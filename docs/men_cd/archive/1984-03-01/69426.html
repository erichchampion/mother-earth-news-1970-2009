        <h5>Issue # 86 - March/April 1984</h5><p><em>The ever-growing menace of pollution is no secret to most MOTHER readers. We live with the news-and some of us encounter immediate examples</em> - of it every day. Power plants emit sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides that can make precipitation as acid as vinegar. Automobiles spew out compounds that react in sunlight to create brown sheets over urban areas. Synthetic organic chemicals invade our underground water supplies. Worse still, some chemical processes result in by-products, such as dioxin, that are so toxic that a mere one part per billion is considered dangerous!</p><p><em>In the face of all these exotic contaminants, how in the world can anyone be concerned over something so mundane as carbon dioxide? We all know that the gas is normally present in our atmosphere in weak concentrations . . . and that it's so nontoxic that we can chill food with it, in the form</em><em>of</em><em>dry ice, and put out fires with extinguishers charged with the compound. Why, without carbon dioxide our gardens wouldn't even grow!</em></p><p><em>Indeed, in any concentration that's likely to occur on earth in the immediate future, carbon dioxide presents no direct threat to our health. But, as two of MOTHER's staff members learned during a visit to the National Center for Atmospheric Research in early October of 1983, the accumulation</em><em>of</em><em>CO 2 in our atmosphere-as the result</em><em>of</em><em>burning fossil fuels-will, in all likelihood, bring about profound changes in our climate within 50 years.</em></p><p><em>Dr. Walter Orr Roberts, president emeritus of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (and retired director</em><em>of</em><em>its laboratory perched on a mesa above Boulder, Colorado), told our team that the majority</em><em>of</em><em>the world's atmospheric physicists believe that the warming trend that would result from the Greenhouse Effect is</em> inevitable. <em>Our editor and photographer were also lucky enough to get a tour of NCAR with the man who knows it best. Inside they saw one</em><em>of</em><em>the world's most powerful computers, a Cray I, where staggeringly complex simulations of our atmosphere's circulation are run at the rate of hundreds</em><em>of</em><em>billions</em><em>of</em><em>calculations per hour. They also visited a "clean room" where the solar telescope for Skylab was built, and there saw an instrument that measures the sun's diameter with amazing accuracy.</em></p><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"><em>Dr. Roberts' credentials and achievements are far too numerous to list here in their, entirety, but a few highlights hint at the scope of his distinguished career. After earning his bachelor's degree at Amherst College, Walt went on to Harvard to complete a master's and a doctoral degree. Then, after matriculation, he became a research associate at the Harvard College Observatory, where he studied the solar corona and the influence of various other solar phenomena on the earth's weather. In 1946 he was named director of the college's High Altitude Observatory. Roberts stayed there, continuing his study</em><em>of</em><em>the sun, until he became the first director</em><em>of</em><em>the National Center for Atmospheric Research in 1960. He was succeeded as director</em><em>of</em><em>that organization in 1968, but he continued as chief executive of the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research-the multimember organization that manages NCAR-until 1973.</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"><em>Dr. Roberts continues as president emeritus</em><em>of</em><em>UCAR and as a research associate at NCAR . . . but also spreads his time between being a professor at the University</em><em>of</em><em>Colorado, a senior fellow</em><em>of</em><em>the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies (where he was director of the Program on Food, Climate and the World's Future from 1974 through 1981-vice president</em><em>of</em><em>the American Philosophical Society, and a faculty member of the Western Behavioral Sciences Institute, where he recently led a telecomputing course on the impact of climate changes on human societies.</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"><em>Though Dr. Roberts still keeps up with developments in the hard science of climate change, his recent interests have leaned toward the effect that future weather may have on the earth's ability to feed its human population. In short, because of his solid scientific background and his keen interest in the social, political, and moral issues of climate change, it would be hard to imagine anyone who is more qualified to speak about the Greenhouse Effect.</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"><em>Throughout the text of this interview, you'll note that nearly everything that's known about the Greenhouse Effect is couched in terms indicating at least a little bit of uncertainty. Being the good scientist that he is, Dr. Roberts would never stoop to calling a calculation or a statistical</em><em>correlation a fact. And, as he emphasized over and over during the conversation, the atmosphere is a tremendously complex system to try to second-guess. The scientific community won't be absolutely sure that our</em><em>planet is becoming warmer because of carbon dioxide accumulation until our climate is several degrees hotter than it is now . . . and even then our understanding of the exact mechanisms may still be hazy. Nonetheless, as one of the most distinguished atmospheric scientists points out in the following interview, there's almost nothing of which he and his colleagues are</em> more <em>certain!</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Dr. Roberts, last fall the Environmental Protection Agency and the National Academy of Sciences both released reports on the Greenhouse Effect. For many people, the idea that humankind's activities might be changing the weather was startling. How long has the scientific community had an inkling of this potential problem?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Well, I suppose it would be almost impossible to recognize the first moment. You see, even the ancient Greeks believed that humans were able to influence the weather . . . both by supernatural acts and by their day-to-day impact on the earth.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">The work that best characterizes modern interest in man's influence on climate, though, is probably the research done independently by two chemists, Arrhenius and Chamberlain. Around the turn of the century, these men recognized that the accumulation of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere could produce a warming effect on the earth. They actually did some extremely crude calculations that predicted almost exactly the magnitude of warming that would occur globally as a result of increasing carbon dioxide levels.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Arrhenius and Chamberlain recognized that human activities were boosting the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere above normal levels?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: I don't know whether you could say <em>above</em> normal, because it's hard to determine just what <em>normal is.</em> The earth's atmosphere has, at various times in the past, probably had much less or much more carbon dioxide than it does now. The variation might be as much as two or three <em>times</em> today's level.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: What magnitude of increase, then, do scientists expect from human influence?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: We're talking about a doubling over the next 50 years from turn-of-the-century levels. The total amount is actually very small: Today C0 2 represents about 330 parts per million (ppm) of our atmosphere, but by 2030 or 2040 it's likely to reach a concentration of 500 to 600 ppm.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY:Where is this additional carbon dioxide coming from?<br /></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: There are many sources, but the one that's probably caused most of the increase over the last 100 years is the burning of fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: You've already mentioned that Arrhenius and Chamberlain thought that increasing levels of CO 2 in the atmosphere might cause the earth's climate to become warmer. Why would that be the case?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: The theory behind the Greenhouse Effect, as this warming trend's usually called, is based on the role carbon dioxide plays in helping the earth retain heat. The atmosphere <em>-</em> including its 330 PPM C0 2 <em>-</em> is very highly transparent to sunlight. The short-wavelength radiant energy coming from the sun warms the earth's surface, but that heat, which is in the form of infrared radiation, would escape from our planet's atmosphere were it not for molecules (such as carbon dioxide) that aren't transparent to infrared. Fortunately, some of the heat from the sun is retained as a result of the effect of carbon dioxide and other partially infrared-opaque molecules.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Without C0 2 , then, we'd be very cold right <em>now?</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: That's right. Without it, Earth would probably be too cold for life. But if our atmosphere were like that of Venus, for example, where carbon dioxide makes up more than 90% of the gases, our planet would be so hot that many metals would melt.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: If carbon dioxide in the atmosphere increases to, say, 550 parts per million <em>-</em> a doubling from turn-of-the-century level <em>-</em> show much warmer is our climate likely to become?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: On the average, the earth's temperature will probably increase about 3° Celsius (5°F). There might be as much as a 10° Celsius (18°F) warming at the poles and as little as a 1 ° Celsius (1.8°F) warming around the equator. Also, some parts of the globe are likely to be colder, while others will become correspondingly much warmer. Climate (and its weather patterns) is a very complex, interactive subject.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Have we seen evidence of this C0 2 -induced warming trend yet?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Carbon dioxide concentrations have increased 20 to 25% since the turn of the century, and we've seen an average of about 1° Celsius (1.8°F) warming during that same period. Some places have been warmer and some have been colder. It's an average of a lot of ups and downs . . . kind of like the stock market: Some values go up and some go down, but analysts can say that the stock market as a whole has risen.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Still, we don't consider this trend to be observational proof of the Greenhouse Effect. There are too many other possible causes for fluctuations. For example, from 1890 to 1940 the climate became warmer in the Northern Hemisphere, and everyone thought at the time that it was a result of the carbon dioxide effect. But from 1940 to 1960, the climate actually got <em>colder . . .</em> and that set people to wondering, "My gosh, maybe the warming wasn't caused by CO 2 after all!" And then, of course, the temperature average started back up again: 1981 was the hottest year in the Northern Hemisphere since the invention of the thermometer.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">The long-term rise in atmospheric carbon dioxide content starting at the time of the industrial revolution and continuing into the next century. The early data were critically reviewed by Callender (1958) and subsequently reevaluated by Barrett (1975). The current series of observations for Mauna Loa are those reported by Keeling, et al. (1976b) and C.D. Keeling (private communication), for South Pole by Keeling, et al. (1976a) and C.D. Keeling (private communication), for American Samoa and Point Barrow by NOAA (1975) and T. Harris (private communication), and for the Swedish aircraft observations by Bolin and Bischof (1970). The model calculations predicting future carbon dioxide increases by Machta (1973), Broecker (1975), and Bacastow and Keeling (1973) all take account of the uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide by oceans and the biosphere (but in somewhat different ways) and assume a nearly exponential increase in the rate of burning of fossil fuels (notably coal) in the next half-century or more. It is expected that, in this time period, about half of the new carbon dioxide released will remain in the atmosphere. Illustration <em>is from Climate Change and Society</em> by William W.

Unburned hydrocarbons <em>-</em> such as gasoline vapors <em>-</em> and other gases may produce between a third and a half of the overall effect.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Furthermore, there are other factors, such as the dispersion of particulate matter in certain layers of our atmosphere, that have the <em>-</em><em>opposite</em> effect.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Do all these influences result from industrialization?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: No, some of them are natural. For instance, when volcanoes erupt and put carbon dioxide (among other things) into the atmosphere, we can't really blame humanity.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: How <em>does</em> the eruption of a volcano such as Mount St. Helens affect climate?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Actually, St. Helens affected carbon dioxide levels very, very little. It's just not a big volcano, as volcanoes go. But the eruption of El Chicõn in Mexico that occurred in April of 1982 was much, much more potent. However, the main effect of El Chicõn wasn't the C0 2 released . . . it was the <em>dust</em> that the eruption spewed way up into the stratosphere. That dust layer reduced the sunlight coming in and caused cooling.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">It's very complicated to figure out whether a given volcano is going to produce heating or cooling over land. Low-level dust or smoke, for instance, can bring about <em>warming.</em> And the effect depends on the season, as well. Still, we think that El Chicõn probably will have produced about 0.8 or 0.9° Celsius (1.3 to 1.5°F) cooling when the final results come in.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Interestingly enough, this cooling effect is roughly equal to the amount of warming the Greenhouse gases may have produced since the start of the industrial revolution. But unlike the Greenhouse Effect, it's shortlived.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Does all of this mean that a warming trend from the 'Greenhouse Effect is less than a sure thing?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: There are, of course, elements of uncertainty, but I would say that the likelihood of carbon dioxide-induced warming is one of the most certain of the predicted atmospheric effects. The idea is based on theoretical calculations, but scientists are more sure of it than they are about almost any other facet of our very, very complicated atmospheric system.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: If (or when) the global average temperature increases 3° Celsius (5 °F), what sorts of problems are we likely to experience? We're obviously going to be more uncomfortable in the summer, but humanity can certainly survive <em>that.</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Well, first of all, the Greenhouse Effect isn't going to be an unmitigated disaster. In fact, there are likely to be areas that actually <em>benefit</em> from it. Our predictions are rather speculative, but East Africa, for example, might get two or three times as much rainfall as it now does.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">One method we have for making such predictions involves looking back at what climatologists call the Altithermal Period, a span of time about 4,000 to 8,000 years ago for which we have relatively good data. The climate at that point in history was warmer on a global scale than it is now, and that difference did result in different circulation patterns in the atmosphere . . . effects similar to those we expect from carbon dioxide.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Was that warming trend similar in magnitude to the one expected from the Greenhouse Effect?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: The doubling of carbon dioxide would probably produce a greater warming than occurred during the Altithermal . . . maybe from 50 to 200% greater.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: So we're perhaps facing a climate change over the course of a century and a half that might exceed anything experienced on earth in thousands of years?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: That's certainly correct. A 3° Celsius (5°F) global warming (with as much as 10° Celsius at the poles and maybe 1 ° Celsius in the tropics) is probably about three times the heating that prevailed in the warm period around 1000 A.D., and it's also greater than the heating during the Altithermal over 4,000 years ago. So it would be unprecedented since the appearance of the first humans on earth, perhaps.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: What exactly can the record of the Altithermal Period tell us about what might happen to our weather during a climate warming?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: The most profound effects are likely to be on moisture patterns: Specifically, there'll be changes in soil moisture brought about by increased or decreased rainfall and/or evaporation. One of my colleagues here at the National Center for Atmospheric Research, William Kellogg, has done a lot of work in this area, using the Altithermal Period as a model in developing a possible scenario.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Now there were lots of variations throughout the period, but if you look at the Altithermal on an average, you do see certain repeated patterns. One of these is that the centers of continents were very dry. The Great Plains of the U.S., for example, were probably drier than they were during the dust bowl. The Altithermal drought most likely extended over most of what is now the great agricultural region of this country.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Similarly, areas such as the Kazakh Desert in the Soviet Union were also drier than they are now. On the other hand, the Sahara may actually have been vegetated back then, since the drought belts moved north, up into the Mediterranean.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Did the characteristic drought belts of today move north, in general?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Yes, the drought belts moved northward in the Northern Hemisphere. On the other hand, it was probably somewhat wetter in the·very high altitudes. In fact, there was probably more rainfall on the earth as a whole. But most of that moisture very likely fell into the oceans, because of a weakening of high-level winds in the atmosphere.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">You see, when the poles get much warmer and the equator a little warmer, the temperature contrast between the polar and equatorial regions is reduced. And since that difference is the force that moves the large-scale winds on our planet, the winds were probably weaker. Major storms wouldn't have penetrated as far inland, so the great volume of moisture that was deposited probably fell on coastal areas and in the oceans.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Does this mean that weather in a warming period might be less variable?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Well, that doesn't necessarily follow. The jet streams and the general circulation of the winds would probably be appreciably weaker. But that doesn't inevitably mean a decrease in variability. Weak systems operating within continents might wander around a larger area, because they wouldn't be controlled so well by the jet stream. The weather would be likely to become more summerlike, but weather during that season is at least as variable as that of the winter. Tornadoes occur in the warmer months, you know.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: One aspect of the Greenhouse Effect that received a great deal of attention from the media after the EPA and NAS announcements was the possibility that ocean levels would rise as a result of the melting of polar ice. Would you care to comment on that potential threat?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: If the warming comes in according to the "3° Celsius in 50 years" scenario, there <em>will</em> be a measurable increase in the height of the oceans . . . but the rise won't happen so quickly that we can't accommodate to it. It'll probably be on the order of a few centimeters (an inch or two) every decade.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">There is, however, the <em>remote</em> possibility that the West Antarctic ice sheet might slide off the land into the ocean. That mass is sort of anchored to the continent by sea ice, which would melt a lot faster than would the ice on land. If the melting of shallow sea ice destabilized the land-bound sheet, causing it to slide rapidly toward the ocean, the sea might rise as much as five meters (16 feet) in a decade or two. That would be very serious, but I think the probability of it happening within a thousand years is, say, 50/50.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Well, where would that put the odds of it happening in the next <em>century?</em></a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Such an event is essentially impossible to predict, but I think the odds are very, very small. It's not a possibility to ignore, though. After all, if every bit of the ice on Antarctica actually melted, you'd get a 50- to 80-meter (165- to 260-foot) rise. And Greenland would add another 5 meters (16 feet). Without a sudden slippage of an ice mass, it would happen at the rate of only a few centimeters per decade, but there would still be significant land mass lost, even during a <em>slow</em> rise.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: How might a C0 2 -induced warming influence the spread of tropical diseases and pests?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Once again, this is a little hard to quantify . . . because the prevalence of such things is very much related to the levels of atmospheric moisture, and we're much less sure about predicting rainfall than we are about predicting temperature. But, in general, the frost-free regions would expand, and freezing is one of the principal ways that diseases and insect pests are controlled. So, as examples, the tsetse fly and schistosomiasis would probably change distribution . . . and both <em>could</em> increase. You might also expect insects such as locusts to change their range, since they need to be close to the tropical zone for vegetation but not so close as to be exposed to the environment of a full tropical rain forest.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">There could also be changes in the prevalence of respiratory diseases in northern climates. The milder weather that would probably occur in Scandinavia and Britain could lessen the incidence of colds, flu, and asthmatic conditions, since there's reason to think that these ailments are encouraged by staying indoors, where pollution is usually worse than it is outside. What's more, some people say that suicide rates in Scandinavia appear to be inversely related to temperature.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: The southwestern U.S. is already experiencing a shortage of water. Is a warming trend likely to bring on a drinking-water crisis?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: In some areas, reduced rainfall <em>may</em> increase the competition between domestic use and irrigation. I don't think that there's an extreme threat to those who rely upon drinking-water supplies, but domestic water in general <em>is</em> likely to become more expensive.

A 1° Celsius rise lengthens the growing season about a week, so southern Canada might get an additional three weeks between first and last frost.

If you take a forest that's at full maturity, its bioproductivity is probably less than that of a young one.

Consequently, more sheep could be grazed, despite the fact that a third of the ground was now given over to trees.

Soil is made up of organisms, and gross intrusion by a chemical or salt is an insult to it that <em>kills</em> those organisms.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">On the other hand, if you go to closed-environment agriculture-as they're doing at the Environmental Research Lab in Arizona-you can grow field crops with about 10% (or even less) of the water you need when using conventional methods. This is simply because the big Mylar greenhouses reduce the loss of evaporated water. The water used is recycled when it condenses on the inside of the covers. What's more, yields may also rise by 500% per acre!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Dr. Roberts, though these things you're describing may make sense to us from almost any perspective, there's not much evidence that they're headed toward widespread implementation. Do you anticipate that climatologists will be able to produce strong enough evidence of the Greenhouse Effect to influence decisionmakers to take appropriate action?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: Well, the answer to the question is <em>yes</em>. The major stumbling block in our computer models today is in predicting the interaction of weather systems with oceans, but we are fairly close to having equipment that can do the job. Definitive predictions are perhaps five to ten years away. But to convince political planners who look two, four, and six years ahead that they should act on something that's 50 years in the future is going to be far more difficult.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">And, of course, many of the people who are now growing wheat are only interested in this year's crop . . . and next year's crop . . . and after that, they'll retire to Florida. You've got to have <em>pride</em> in the land to husband it well. That's one of the reasons why you see land in Europe that's beautifully cared for, even though there's no immediate large economic return. Soils there are more fertile now than they were when we started planting the Great Plains . . . and our Department of Agriculture says that we're exporting more than a 'quarter-bushel of soil (into the Gulf of Mexico) for every bushel of wheat we produce.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Last year I visited a little wine cellar in Hungary, one that I'd been to 20 years before. The man I'd met on my first visit had passed away, but his son was running the winery. And while I was there, his grandson stopped by with <em>his</em> new baby. I asked how long the vineyard on that beautiful hillside had been in the family. They said, "Forever!" When I seemed doubtful, they replied that they'd tended it <em>at least</em> since the year 1500.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Yet-in this country-farms are steadily becoming ever bigger and more obsessed with year-to-year profit statements. The corporate structure is taking over from the individual family. And is that corporation wedded to the soil . . . or will it just abandon the ground and go somewhere else when the nutrients and water are completely mined?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Then; in your view, we have some fundamental problems with the way we practice agriculture, and a carbon dioxide-induced warming may bring out the worst of some of those methods?</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">ROBERTS: True, but if and when we have a doubling of carbon dioxide, I have no doubt whatsoever that there will be accommodations and adjustments. The earth will adapt. We talk about how fragile our planet is, and in a sense that's true. But our ecosystems also have tremendous curative and restorative capabilities. The earth can adapt to a quadrupled increase in carbon dioxide. It's just that certain interests will suffer. .</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">James Lovelock's Gaia Hypothesis suggests that there are feedback loops that allow systems to adjust to changing conditions. Now I don't go along with the concept of the earth's atmospheric system as a living, sentient entity, but I do think that those mechanisms of self-adjustment and compensation exist and are important.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">PLOWBOY: Perhaps the question, then, is whether <em>we'll</em> be adjusted out of the scene.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p>ROBERTS: Well, the most likely cause of <em>that</em> would be a nuclear war . . . then humankind probably <em>would</em> be written out of the scene.
