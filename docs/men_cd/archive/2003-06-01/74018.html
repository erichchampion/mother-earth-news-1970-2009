                    <h5 id="byline">      by Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      Fresh basil may well be the signature herb of summer,      perfuming our gardens and flavoring our foods with its      delightful clovelike essence.    </p>    <p>      Historically, basil has been associated with emotions      ranging from love to hate. Various religious sects have      used it ceremonially to pave the way to both heaven and      hell; according to early 20th-century herbalist Maude      Grieve, "Every good Hindu goes to his rest with a Basil      leaf on his breast. This is his passport to Paradise."    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      COOKING WITH BASIL    </h2>    <p>      Not surprisingly, admiration for this delicious and      aromatic herb eventually won out over ancient fears of its      mystical powers; today, few basil lovers ever get enough of      it to eat. Fresh basil leaves are closely associated with      traditional Italian foods, especially pasta and tomatoes,      and basil also has deep roots in the cuisines of Thailand      and India, where the first plants probably originated.    </p>    <p>      Contemporary basil-crazy cooks find many ways to use it.      Basil pairs well with pasta or tomatoes, but it also works      nicely with a number of other vegetables, from asparagus to      summer squash.    </p>    <p>      The quirky thing about basil is in the cooking-it      should be added only at the end of the process because when      cooked, it quickly loses its bouquet. This characteristic      may be one reason that pesto-a thick, pureed sauce of      fresh basil leaves, olive oil, garlic and nuts-is the      most popular way to make use of a copious supply. Basil      also can be used raw in marinades, as a wrap or in salads      to delicious effect.    </p>        <p>      Preserving basil for winter use can be tricky. It blackens      when bruised, cut or frozen, and loses much of its flavor      when dried, so handle it carefully. In summer, many      gardeners freeze small containers of prepared pesto for      wintertime treats. Other great ways to save a little basil      magic are to make and freeze basil cream sauce (see our      low-fat recipe, Page 80), or to freeze individual leaves.      Just rinse and gently pat the leaves dry, lay them out on a      cookie sheet and pop them in the freezer. After an hour or      so, when they are frozen crisp, quickly transfer them to a      labeled storage container and place it in the freezer.      Basil vinegar and basil-infused oil are tasty options for      hoarding the herb's flavor, too.    </p>    <h3>      CHOOSING VARIETIES    </h3>    <p>      The best culinary basils are called sweet basils,      classified botanically as Ocimum basilicum. My personal      favorites are the small-leafed globe basils 'Spicy Bush' or      'Minette,' which fit into tight spaces and are very slow to      flower. For flavor, it's hard to go wrong with any variety      described as a "Genovese type." I love small-leafed      'Piccolo' or 'Fino Verde,' too, but I know better than to      get stuck on a favorite. Plenty of good ones, including      subspecies that carry s cents of cinnamon, lemon and even      anise or camphor, are available. All of these are fun to      grow, though I have settled upon lemon basils as the only      scented strains for my garden. A few plants of a      dark-leafed red or opal basil, such as 'Red Rubin,' add      lovely color to the garden, too.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/198-079-03.jpg" alt="198-079-03.jpg" width="93" height="59" />    </div>    <h3>      Basil Cream Sauce    </h3>    <p>      Fresh or frozen, this easy, low-fat cream sauce is great      with pasta, poultry or a variety of vegetables.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons butter<br />      1 large clove garlic, quartered<br />      2 tablespoons plain flour<br />      1/4 teaspoon each salt and freshly ground black      pepper<br />      2 cups lowfat milk or soy milk<br />      2 cups fresh basil leaves</em>    </p>    <p>      Melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat.      Add the garlic and cook 2 minutes, until the aroma is      released. Mix in flour, stirring constantly. Still      stirring, mix in the milk or soy milk, a little at a time,      allowing the sauce to thicken between additions. After all      the milk has been added, cook and stir the sauce for 5      minutes. Chop the basil. As soon as the sauce begins to      bubble, remove the garlic and stir in the basil. Cook for 3      minutes more, until the basil wilts and the pieces no      longer float to the top. Cool slightly and freeze in      airtight plastic containers. If desired, the sauce can be      processed until smooth in a food processor or blender      before freezing. To reheat: Thaw, then warm gently,      stirring over medium-low heat.    </p>    <p>      Variations: You can transform it into a cheese sauce by      adding % cup grated cheese per 1 cup sauce. Or, jazz it up      with a squeeze of lemon juice or a sprinkling of curry      powder.    </p></div>    <h3>      WHAT'S THAT SMELL?    </h3>    <p>      The rich aroma of basil will envelope your garden on a warm      summer day. Chemically, basil's floral scent is due in part      to the presence of linalool, which some insects find      repellent. In India and Africa, people sometimes rub      handfuls of basil on their skin to repel insects. This may      or may not work to repel North American mosquitoes, but why      not try it? Being bathed in basil's beautiful scent would      make any work session in the garden more enjoyable.    </p>    <p>      A warm-weather annual, basil can be grown only in summer in      most of North America. Seeds are easy to start indoors a      few weeks before your last frost (or simply buy seedlings      when you are ready to plant in late spring).    </p>    <p>      Basil germinates best at about 70 degrees. If you have a      long growing season, sow a second crop in early summer,      because the plants you start in spring will deteriorate      before the season ends. In my Zone 7 garden, I plant basil      a third time in early August to make sure I have plants to      carry me through the fall. Once summer heats up,      direct-sowing the shiny black seeds where you want them to      grow works well. Outdoors, expect a germination rate of      about 60 percent. Plants are bushy, so space seedlings at      least a foot apart.    </p>    <p>      Whether grown in beds or containers, basil requires warm,      well-drained soil. In cool climates, the plants must have      full sun; where summers are long and hot, partial afternoon      shade is welcome. To support basil's fast growth, fertilize      your plants every few weeks beginning in early summer with      a liquid plant food such as a seaweed/fish emulsion      product.    </p>    <p>      It also is crucial to pinch plants back regularly after      they've grown at least 6 to 8 inches tall. This helps      induce branching. It's an aromatic and joyous job because      each time you pinch, you release fragrance and harvest      sprigs for your kitchen. As summer wears on, continue      pinching stem tips often to delay flowering. If your plants      get away from you and cover themselves with flower spikes,      just prune them back by one-third. Within a week or two,      you should see a fresh crop of new stem tips emerging.    </p>    <p>      To use your pruned-off flower spikes, dry them in a warm,      airy place and add them to potpourri sachets or dream      pillows (they're too woody to use for cooking). Basil dies      at the first hint of frost, but the plants should remain      fragrant for several weeks afterward, reminding you of the      pleasures of summer while the world is aglow with autumn's      glory.    </p>    <h3>      MYSTERY WILT    </h3>    <p>      Sometimes, basil plants suddenly wilt to death due to a      soil-borne fungus called fusarium, which injures the roots      and main stem. To diagnose this disease, look for a dark      brown patch on the main stem near the soil line. The      fusarium strain to blame is specific to basil; it's a      little different from the fusariums that bother beans,      tomatoes and other crops. There is no cure, but one of the      first-ever hybrid basils, 'Nufar,' shows good resistance to      the disease. Rotating your basil to a new space each year,      planting fusarium-free seed, and maintaining excellent      drainage and air circulation discourage the disease.    </p>    <p>      Excerpted from Barbara Pleasant's forthcoming book, <em>The      Whole Herb</em> .    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
