                    <h5 id="byline">      by Joe Hurst-Wajszczuk    </h5>    <p>      Is your kitchen counter curling up at the edges? Are you      ever going to fix that broken handle on your favorite      coffee cup? Are your most comfortable running shoes falling      apart? Here's how to pick the right glue for every repair      job!    </p>    <p>      Four thousand years ago, ancient Egyptians made glue by      boiling animal hides and used the substance as a binder in      paint and for woodworking. This early glue technology      didn't change much until the middle of the 20th century,      when different organic and synthetic glues began to be      developed.    </p>    <p>      Today, dozens of glues designed to stick virtually anything      to anything else are on the market. Favorite "anythings"      include ceramics, fabric, glass, leather, metal, paper,      plastic, rubber, Styrofoam, vinyl and wood; mix and match      as needed. Despite the advances, no miracle glue has yet      been invented; what works well with some materials may not      work at all with others.    </p>    <p>      To help you make the right choices, a glue "vocabulary" and      a handy chart that lists the different types, their uses,      properties and other facts follow. All glues are about the      same strength as long as you use them according to the      directions. Remember, some are toxic or contain irritants,      so try to use the least-toxic glue available for your job.    </p>    <h3>      THE VOCABULARY OF GLUE    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Open-assembly time:</strong> This is the period of      time you have between when you spread the glue on the      surface and when it starts to set. If you're fixing the      handle on a broken mug, you want a glue with a short      "open-assembly time"-in other words, a "quick-set"      glue. If you're working on a more complex job, such as      repairing an antique chair, use a glue with a long      open-assembly time so you have time to fit all the pieces      together.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cure times</strong> The amount of time it takes for      the glue to form its maximum bond. This can vary from as      few as 24 hours for white or yellow glue to as long as a      week or more for some epoxies.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Shelf life:</strong> Good glues do go bad. "Shelf      life" refers to the period of time that glue remains      useable. White, yellow and polyurethane glues last for      about a year if properly stored in airtight containers.      Hot-melt sticks and epoxies remain useable for many years.      Improper storage can cause glue to spoil prematurely. (For      this reason, buying a larger container isn't always a      bargain.) As a rule, if the working properties of a      particular glue seem abnormal, don't use it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pot life:</strong> For those glues that require      mixing, "pot life" refers to the time you have to apply the      glue to your work after you have mixed it. Epoxies have pot      lives that vary from five to 30 minutes; if you need more      time, lowering the glue's temperature will extend its pot      life.    </p>    <p>      Related Article:<br />      Choose Your Glue Chart    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
