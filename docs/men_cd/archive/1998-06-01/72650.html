            		    <p>      <strong>Energy and Environment</strong>    </p>    		<p>      <strong><em>A California rancher becomes his own      utility.</em></strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Douglas Bath    </h5>        <p>      I met Terry Montgomery for the first time one mid-summer      afternoon in 1993. Terry and his wife Taffy were looking      into purchasing remote land in Mendocino County and had an      idea that they might want an alternative approach to their      energy needs. I am always interested in the way a person's      interest in renewable energy evolves. An event sometimes      provides a new perspective on the way things are done.      Terry put it this way: "I once served as the chief of staff      for the governor of Minnesota. During that time a      tremendous groundswell of resentment rose up from the      normally soft-spoken inhabitants of rural Minnesota when      the utility began to run a 400kW powerline across the land.      The National Guard had to be called out. This made me      ponder the choices between energy consumption and the      environment."    </p>    <p>      "I was raised on a cattle ranch in a remote part of South      Dakota where we had no electrical power. In my adult life,      I took electrical power as a given, but my upbringing      allowed me to face the prospect of a more austere lifestyle      without a lot of trepidation."    </p>    <p>      The first requirement of being a homepower troubleshooter      is flexibility. There are as many individual permutations      of renewable energy systems as there are people who need      them. I did my best that afternoon to provide Terry with      valuable information for his situation without losing him      in a miasma of techno-babble. In a soft-spoken      conversational manner, he would first ask an intelligent      question, then play out a fair amount of rope. I could then      try and tie a pretty knot with it, or hang myself. This      went on for about two hours. At the end of our      conversation, we went our separate ways on amicable terms,      with me wondering if I had left Terry a baffled and      unlikely client, a more informed but still unlikely client,      or a very informed but still unlikely client, or a very      informed and very likely client. Either way, I felt      brain-picked. Over the next few months, Terry called or      stopped by for more information, which ultimately resulted      in a rough quotation for an energy system large enough to      handle the rigors of a full working ranch.    </p>    <p>      Taffy had run a successful equestrian business when she and      Terry lived in Minnesota, and her love of horses meant they      would need some real open space for their animals. As they      toured Mendocino County in search of the right place, Taffy      and Terry told me they were able to use the information I      had provided to evaluate some of the installations they ran      across.    </p>    <p>      Mendocino County certainly deserves recognition as one of      the independent energy hubs of the world. This means that      the evolution of renewable power systems has stumbled      through the sometimes haphazard installation techniques of      people with limited funds, ability, or understanding of      what they were trying to accomplish. The early "Mendo"      systems are sometimes remarkably ugly electrical systems      which somehow seem to work in spite of poor installation      and years of neglect. Local solar-powered homes which had a      more conventional appearance and energy use patterns      (rather than the more rustic, low-tech homes with kerosene      lamps and cigarette-lighter outlets) gave Terry and Taffy      inspiration. Terry didn't want to have a Rube Goldberg      energy system, but one that would offer safety and quality      in appearance and function. Armed with the conviction that      a renewable energy system could satisfy his needs, he      purchased Thunderhawk Ranch. 185 acres of off-the-grid      heaven.    </p>    <p>      The rolling grasslands at the top end of this      three-thousand-foot mountain offer tremendous vistas of      Redwood Valley, Ukiah, and the surrounding mountains, as      well as excellent forage for the critters. The local      utility company, however, showed little interest in      Thunderhawk Ranch. With no more than a few homes to service      and miles of power poles to install, the cost would be      prohibitive to the end user and gain little for the      utility.    </p>    <p>      Terry took to heart my insistence that he would be best      served by using the least electricity and ordered a Sun      Frost RF-16 refrigerator. His other priorities were to      carefully lay out his 3,800-square-foot ranch-style home      with abundant vertical south-facing glass, and use 2 x 6      studs for his framing members, allowing ample insulation of      the house shell. He also decided to add several skylights      along the hallway that runs the length of the house for      very effective passive lighting. Terry specified      fluorescent lighting throughout the home, garage, and barn.      Difficult compromises in energy efficiency were made when a      1.5 horse-power submersible pump and a forced air heating      system were installed. By every appearance, this is a ranch      home that offers high efficiency through thoughtful design      and simple elegance.    </p>    <h3>Power for the Posse</h3>        <p>      Between the time we first outlined an energy system and the      installation, Trace Engineering unveiled their new 4000W      sine-wave inverter, the SW4024. This remarkable inverter      provides utility-quality power, efficient battery charging,      auto generator starting capacity, as well as 220V AC power      when mated to a second SW4024. A pair of these inverters      could easily satisfy the needs of Terry and Taffy, as well      as those of any visiting guests. Energy storage is in the      form of sixteen Trojan L. 16 batteries (1400 amp-hour at      24V, or about 35kWh maximum) which are housed in a      hinged-lid battery enclosure.    </p>    <p>      A manual transfer switch allows Terry to select between his      primary Honda 10kW diesel generator and a 5kW gasoline      backup generator. A second manual transfer switch offers      the ability to bypass die battery/inverter system and have      the generator power die home directly.    </p>    <p>      Initially, all power was to be provided by a 10kW diesel      generator running about three hours per day. The large      battery bank and battery chargers built into the inverters      can salt away a lot of energy to be used during the rest of      die day. Terry explains his program this way. "I wanted to      get tire fundamental system and then start adding renewable      power sources. We chase components that would allow us to      add a variety of energy sources down the road"    </p>        <p>      After a year of running the facility by generator only,      Terry opted to deploy an 800W solar electric array and a      small, 300W turbine. Solar has a proven track record in      Mendocino County, and running a small wind turbine for a      few years can prove whether one has a good wind site or      not. The solar has now, been operating for three years, and      the wind turbine two and a half. I recently asked Taffy how      she met her energy needs these days. "We run the generator      about an hour a day in the summer to top off our 10,000      gallon storage tank. Otherwise, the solar will take care of      all our needs in the summer. I don' t think that a big wind      turbine would he all that cost effective for us at this      point. We are quite happy with die way the system operates      now, although we haven't seen much sun lately!" It wouldn't      be a timely article without Taffy's reference to El      Ni√±o.    </p>    <h3>Coming Full Circle</h3>    <p>      Like tier husband, Taffy spent her early years without      electricity. On her family's New Hampshire dairy farm, she      says, "We had no electricity until the Health Department      decided that we couldn't use frozen pond water to keep the      milk cold. My father had to buy a generator to nun a      refrigeration system, but that was always breaking down, so      our electricity was intermittent at best. I never thought      that I would he going back to a similar-but so      different-way of life. We once again live in a fairly      remote location, but with the amenities of city living."    </p>    <p>      As I got into my car to leave Thunderhawk Ranch, I took a      moment to soak up the view. Tonohon. the sixteen-year-old      donkey, was braying for attention. The brisk winds of March      rippled the brown grass of last year with die rich new      grass starring to push up from below. I reflected upon the      sequence of events that had brought me to this hill. In      this industry, we must have an abundance of patience. Terry      had told me how annoyed he was when I fast told him that a      conventional refrigerator would be bad news for a remote      home. He had just bought a new one, and this was another      fly in the ointment in his search for paradise. The      education of the client is a long-term investment. Terry      and Taffy are well on their way.    </p>
