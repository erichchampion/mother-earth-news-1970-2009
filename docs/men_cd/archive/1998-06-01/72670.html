            		    <p>      <strong>Season</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Chasing      tornadoes, lightning bugs, and other summer wonders.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaaf    </h5>        <p>      Many people think of spring as the season for tornadoes,      and generally they are right. The strongest tornadoes      usually reach their peak of occurrence in May. About the      third week of May, Oklahoma and the Texas Panhandle is, on      an average, the place and time where the world's most      violent weather phenomenon is at its fiercest and most      common. Back in February, we saw - tragically -      that Florida and the Gulf Coast have an early tornado      season, though usually not as early as in this year of a      strong El Niño. Likewise, June and July bring the      threat of tornadoes farther north - to eastern      Colorado, for instance, where smaller tornadoes are      numerous in early June, and even to the Northeast U.S.,      where a second peak of frequency for the year comes in July      and early August.    </p>    <p>      Most of us have heard that tornadoes in the Northeast are      usually far less powerful than their cousins in the Plains.      But what's interesting is that scientists and storm-chasers      have learned so much about severe weather in the past few      decades that they can now give separate terms to a number      of different varieties of atmospheric vortex, including      some of the weaker tornadoes. This isn't just a matter of      classifying tornadoes from FO (weakest) to F5 (strongest)      on the famous Fujita scale, which relies on the type of      damage caused. Different tornadoes and other whirlwinds      have different means of formation.    </p>    <p>      Two kinds of vortex which are visibly different than      tornadoes have been known and named for a long time:      waterspouts and dust devils. You might think that a      waterspout is just a tornado over water. Actually, the true      waterspout forms over the water and is typically much      weaker than a tornado. In cases where the vortex forms from      a severe thunderstorm over land and moves onward to pass      over water, it can have a ferocity far exceeding the true      waterspout. As for dust devils, these whirls occasionally      can be big and strong enough to be dangerous, but their      genesis is from localized heating. Their source of energy      is limited. The source of most strong tornadoes is the      energy of a major weather system concentrated by a      super-cell thunders, form and a special rotating region of      these storms called a mesocyclone. The mesocyclone. might      be typically five miles in diameter and produce a tornado      up to a mile wide.    </p>    <h3>      Lightning Safety Remainders    </h3>        <p>      Lightning kills more people in the U.S. each year than      tornadoes do. Many of the deaths and injuries could have      been avoided if people followed certain basic safety tips.      I've discussed some of these here before, but it's well to      repeat them.    </p>    <p>      When is lightning too close for you to be outside? You can      estimate the distance of lightning by noting the number of      seconds between the lightning and its thunder and dividing      this by five to get the distance in miles. Certainly      lightning three miles away is getting too close for safety.      In fact, you should really play it much safer, because      there i no guarantee that the next bolt will not come from      another part of the cloud and be tight on you. If far from      shelter initially, remember that thunderstorms can      occasionally advance at speeds of 50 mph or faster.    </p>    <p>      The worst situation of all is to be the highest object in      an area. A boat or swimmer on the water or a person      standing in a large field or out on the open plains is in      grave danger of being struck by lightning. If you can't      escape and find yourself in this situation, get down as low      as possible-even if you feel your lair stand on end,      you may avert the strike if you throw yourself down. Water      is worst of all because it can conduct electricity so well.    </p>    <p>      Most people realize that they are relatively safe from      lightning in a motor vehicle, with its goal grounding and      rubber tires. On the other hand, most don't realize how      hazardous-potentially deadly-it is to be on the phone      with an electrical storm nearby.    </p>    <p>      Waterspouts and dust devils look very different and occur      in very different environments than tornadoes. But some of      the new subclasses of tornado would not immediately he      differentiated by the layperson, Some of these terns for      them are slang of storm chasers, but they make gold sense.      A landspout is a small weak tornado which typically doesn't      arise from a mesocyclone or a supercell but instead from      less severe thunderstorms and other convective clouds. Most      of the many tornadoes of eastern Colorado in June are      landspouts. A gustnado is a weak tornado which is formed      from the gust front, the line of winds which races out      ahead of a thunderstorm.    </p>        <p>      <strong>A LM A NAC June-July 1998</strong><br />      2 Coronation Day (in U.K.). 3 First American spacewalk, by      Edward White on Gemini 4 in 1965.<br />      6 World Environment Day.<br />      7 Trinity Sunday.<br />      10 FULL MOON, 12:18 A.M.

The only major vortices I've ever seen were a group of      cold-air funnels in North Dakota. A meteorologist friend      and I rode bicycles to within about a mile of the nearest      of these funnels before it dissipated. We weren't taking      much of a risk, though in rare cases such a vortex might      generate winds in roughly the 70 to 100 mph range.    </p>    <p>      By the way, a funnel cloud is a condensation funnel which      is not in contact with the ground. If its end ever touches      the ground, it is then classified as a tornado. Not every      tornado has a visible funnel, however. In some cases, an      observer may see only a whirl of debris down on the      surface, but the phenomenon can still be classified as a      tornado. It can still be pan of a violent storm, however,      and nay or tray not he something fun to chase after on your      bicycle.    </p>    <h3>Night Lights</h3>    <p>      The sky can bring many other wondrous of summer's arrival.      One of the most welcome a that first early June night when      the fireflies begin their flashing.    </p>    <p>      There are other luminescent creatures in the world, but      none quite like these. There are about 50 species in the      U.S. and many more in the tropics. All share the property      of having a marvelous final segment or two of their soft      bodies which is capable of lighting up with a pale      radiance.    </p>    <p>      What is the secret of this cool green illumination? How do      fireflies produce light without heat? Scientists have      identified the chemicals luciferin, luciferase, and      adenosine triphosphate at work, and there apparently has      been progress in understanding the cold fire in recent      years. But much of the mystery remains. We see it on the      wing, the living lights of the fireflies putting out their      marvelous messages in light to attract mates.    </p>    <p>      Glowworms are the wingless females of some firefly species.      They signal to the airborne males above from among the      stems of grass. Fireflies are not flies, but a kind of      beetle.    </p>    <p>      The larvae live underground and in rotting wood or refuse.      They eat tiny insects, as the adults probably do too      - except for some kinds which may never eat at all      once they become adults.    </p>    <p>      Early summer seems to be the optimum time for fireflies. In      his book <em>A Walk Through the Year</em> , naturalist and      entomologist Edwin Way Teale writes of a great display of      fireflies observed by him and his wife in Connecticut on      one June 21.    </p>    <p>      Teale goes on to say that fireflies seem most numerous in      the air between about 10 P.m. and midnight, "on nights      moist and warn." It seems many of us-Teale and I      included - have looked up spellbound to see them      intermingle with numerous stars in what were, therefore,      rather non-humid nights. Is that point of light you see 60      feet or 60 light-years away? I'm pretty certain I've seen      fireflies floating among the tops of 100-foot tall tees,      but their distance can indeed be difficult to estimate.    </p>    <p>      I wonder if it was heat, humidity, or both which has set      off displays of fast, seemingly wild and erratic flashing      which I've seen in fireflies a few times when a      thunderstorm was approaching. Could their strange behavior      have been due to the charge in the air? From the ozone from      lightning? But the storms had not arrived yet...    </p>    <p>      Or - is it possible? - were the little bugs      reacting to the flashing from what their instincts mistook      for a sky-wide firefly? Some people - my wife is one      of them-grew up calling fireflies by one of their      popular names: lightning bugs.    </p>    <p>      Surely everyone has caught a firefly in his or her hand and      watched the pulsing glow shine out from within. We still      often hear people encouraging kids to capture-and      keep - as many of them as possible in jars. That may      not be such a good idea. Of course, in some years and some      places, the number of fireflies is stupendously      large-in the year of Teale's memorable display he      asked, "In this June night, who can guess how many billion      fireflies are on wing above the dark fields of eastern      Connecticut?"    </p>    <p>      But there <em>are</em> individual species of firefly whose      numbers are small. In any case, we creed to teach respect      for the living world to our children. If, as a child, you      don't learn respect for the magic of fireflies, what in      nature will you ever respect?    </p>
