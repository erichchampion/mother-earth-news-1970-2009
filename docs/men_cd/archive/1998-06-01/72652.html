                <p>      <strong>Country Skills</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Quick! How fast      can you tie a clove hitch?</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Doug Thalacker    </h5>    <p>      ILLUSTRATIONS: HEADLINE TYPE: RODNEY A. OKYNE    </p>                <p>      A hitch for when the clove hitch can't be tied. It is not      as easy to<br /> untie as the clove unless you "slip" it.    </p>    		    <p>      The most useful way to make a loop in the<br /> end of a rope. It      is better than the more<br /> common loop knot because it is easy      to<br /> untie, even when the rope is wet. It also<br /> has a mnemonic      for tying it-the rabbit<br /> (end of the rope) comes out      of the hole<br /> (overhand loop), runs around the tree<br /> (standing      rope), and goes back down the<br /> hole.    </p>        <p>      This is one of the best ways to secure two pieces of rope      together,<br /> particularly if they are of different sizes.    </p>	    <p>      <em>Three times a true-loves knot I tie secure Firm be the      knot, firm may his love endure.</em> (Early American lose      rhyme)    </p>    <p>      Have you ever been driving along and wondered how a sofa      gets on the side of the road? Have you ever reached your      destination only to find that something formerly on the top      of your car or trailer is no longer there, and then      wondered if someone else is driving down the road wondering      how <em>your</em> item got on the side of the road? I      imagine that in the days of covered wagons there      were...well. you get the picture. We have all been a victim      of the Bad Knot Syndrome. It's not that we are careless,      it's just that to most people, multiple bends and twists in      a rope constitute a knot. We don't give much thought to      ropes and knots until we lose something over the side or      off the top. Or we get that something to the other end,      only to find that we have to use Alexander's solution (keep      reading) to get the stuff off-and lose a good rope in      the process.    </p>    <p>      Knots have been with humans as long as ropes have, but,      unlike ropes, they have taken on many uses beyond merely      securing objects. The peoples of the Andes developed the      <em>quipi</em> (Quechua for knot) for doing mathematical      calculations and as an accounting method. The abacus of the      Arabian cultures is thought to have started as knotted      ropes; the Hebrew-Aramaic word <em>abaq</em> means "make a      loop or knot." Polynesian people kept genealogies with      ropes and knots.    </p>    <p>      Knots were also used for more mystical purposes. In most      cultures, people tied knots to bind up the winds and rain,      bind lovers together (the modern wedding band probably      evolved from betrothal knots), tie up illnesses, secure      fevers, not to mention more malevolent pursuits such as      murder and torture. The most famous knot is possibly the      Gordian knot. The story goes something like this. Apollo      chose Gordius, apparently a farmer, to rule a small      kingdom. As an offering, Gordius tied his plow to the      temple of Apollo with a knot so cunning that the ends of      the rope were hidden. The oracles soon foretold that      whoever untied the knot would he the ruler of Asia. The      knot baffled everyone who attempted to untie it until      Alexander (soon to be the Great) came. He was also stymied,      until in a fit of frustration-or genius-he took      out his sword and cut the knot in one swift stroke. He went      on to role most of the known world.    </p>    <p>      In today's world-with the invention of such items as      the hook-and-eye (Velcro), the zipper, and various designs      of nylon straps and ratchets-knots have become less      important for securing things. However, working knowledge      of some basic knots is still important for those times when      modern-day securing devices are unavailable or impractical.    </p>    <p>      What is the best knot? Well, it depends. The best knot for      any situation is one that: (1) holds when it is supposed      to; (2) a relatively easy to untie without a knife and; (3)      does not bend the rope in such a way that the rope itself a      weakened. Fishing is a prime example of the last factor.      When a fish breaks off and you're left with a little      curlicue at the end, it means the knot weakened the line.      Three basic words describe the anatomy of virtually any      knot. They also have the virtue of making you sound      knowledgeable about knots if the subject happens to come up      in cocktail party conversation. They are:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bight:</strong> a bend in a rope.    </p>    <p>      <strong>End:</strong> I'll let you guess at this one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Hitch:</strong> a knot used to bind a rope to an      object.    </p>

It works best on round posts but can be made more secure with a hall hitch. It comes loose easily when tension is released on the rope.
