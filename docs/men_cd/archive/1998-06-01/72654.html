            		    <p>      <strong>Land and Law</strong>    </p>    		<p>		<em>What are      your rights in a land dispute?</em>		</p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Jean Vernon    </h5>        <p>      <em>In 1972, my wife and her late husband purchased 3,800      acres in a western state. For many years, the only access      to the east side teas an old road off of a county road that      the original homesteader used. An aerial photo taken in      1952 shows the road well within the fence line for about a      half mile to the homestead.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>My wife's family used this road for many years to      access the property for hunting and fishing and other      recreation. Even after they moved out of state, they      returned from tune to time. The only other access was the      long way around or through a section of state land, if the      old jeep trails through it were even passable.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>During the mid '70s, the adjacent land was developed      into a subdivision of approximately ten-acre parcels. This      sub division engulfed the old road. The family continued to      use the road up until 1991. During her late husbands      illness, my wife sold much of the property but held on to      part of it.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>When we married, my wife and I moved to the township      sixteen miles away to begin building on the property.      Everything was fine for a while. Then we moved a fifth      wheel onto the property, and also a 10' by 50' mobile      office. We were blockaded at the subdivision entrance by      two members of the subdivision home-owners association. I      couldn't reason with them, and my son had to get the      sheriff. The sheriff escorted us to the property gate,      approximately three miles, and stated that we bad legal      access to our land.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Shortly thereafter, we had to go to California to help      our daughter after an earthquake and were gone for over      year.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>In the meantime, the ten acres at our entry gate was      purchased, and the owner sealed the gate with wire and      dumped a pile of dirt in the road on his side of the fence.      He then sent my son a letter telling him to stay of the ten      acres or go to court. My son is not the legal owner, so he      passed the letter on to me. We returned to reason with the      association to no avail. We even offered to pal' our share      of the road maintenance.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As a result of limited finances, we refrained from      legal counsel, and since we were essentially land-locked,      they wouldn't even let us remove the RV and trailer. They      are sitting there deteriorating to this day.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Meanwhile, the portion of land my wife sold was turned      into a subdivision. The road building was difficult and the      developer finally abandoned the project. During this time,      a legal easement and road was created to our west entrance.      It is ten miles farther and only accessible in dry weather      we haven't been able to build on our land because cement      trucks and propane trucks refuse to use the new road. We      desire to be a good neighbor.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Can you help?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-R. A.<br />      Name and address withheld</em>    </p>    <p>      Easements are the boon and bane of many country property      owners! It sounds as if you originally had an easement by      prescription to the land: that is, an access route that was      used for so long that access could not be denied. Such an      easement does not usually have to be used on a daily basis,      only used consistently according to the type of land. For      example, if the land was used for recreational purposes,      then sporadic use of the easement a enough to maintain      rights of access. <em>But in many states when you cease      using this type of easement, you may be in danger of losing      it.</em>    </p>    <p>      Easement law is complicated, however, and it varies from      state to state. It is possible that an easement used for      recreational purposes will not be acceptable for      residential purposes, although if the land was an old      homestead, your easement will probably provide residential      access.    </p>    <p>      Financial considerations not with-standing, you must check      with an attorney to determine your rights. Be sure to take      care in locating an attorney well versed in easements. Most      are not, and many do not even realize easements are      practically a field unto themselves.    </p>    <p>      Mother consideration: in many states if you allow a      situation to continue for a certain number of years without      taking any action, you give up any rights you may have had      to pursue the matter. Do not delay on this. Seek an      attorney and consult him or her immediately. It may be      possible that your attorney can explain your rights to the      concerned parties and that will be the end of it. Good      luck.    </p>    <p>      <em>I purchased a ten-acre patented mining claim in the      mountains of Colorado. The land is located within a      national forest. The access road was originally closed off      by the Forest Service, but a few years before I bought the      land, someone bad torn the sign down. The real estate      company assured me the Forest Service could not deny access      to my land. I wrote to the forest service asking permission      to use the road. They wrote back saying it could take years      to receive road access permission from them, and they      demanded to see a building permit, even though I had not      mentioned building in my letter. I did not reply to this      and so far am continuing to use the road.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>After all that, I called a building inspector and asked      what I needed to do to get a building permit. He told me I      could build up to 160 square feet without a permit. He then      asked me where the land was. When I tried to explain the      location and that there are other cabins in the area, he      suddenly changed his opinion and recommended that I not      build at all. He also stated that if there is an existing      cabin on the land, I could not even add a nail to it      without a permit. All I wanted to know is if I could put up      a small cabin on the land, but I just got a runaround and      no answer.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Could you please answer my questions? (1) Can the      Forest Service deny me access or is the road grandfathered      in? The mine was founded in 1899). (2) Is the building      inspector wrong about building a cabin on the land when be      doesn't know where it is located? Can I build a cabin      without electricity and water? (3) How do I determine if I      have water rights to my land?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Jackie Arnold<br />      Red Cliff, Colorado</em>    </p>    <p>      One should always verify legal access and other rights      before buying real estate. If you want to build on land,      you should always verify that you can do so before the      purchase is finalized. To answer your questions:    </p>    <p>      (1) About your access: Allan Grimshaw, with the U.S. Forest      Service, Aspen Ranger District, was very helpful in      clarifying the access question for you. He states that the      Forest Service roads provide public access, and that      includes landowner access for parcels within the national      forest. However, the forest supervisor may close some roads      on a seasonal basis to protect them from damage due to      seasonal instability. During such closures, a landowner      usually my continue to use the road but my be responsible      for my damage he or she my cause. When writing such      closures, the supervisor my exempt landowners, or require      them to obtain a special use permit allowing them to use      the road.    </p>    <p>      Mr Grimshaw cautions that the Forest Service is not in the      business of providing roads or maintenance like the county,      but generally does not deny public access over its roads.      He also warns that certain areas in the state are very      confusing, with mining claims that pre-dated the national      forest, non-existing roads still on record, and      non-official roads that do exist. You should check directly      with your local ranger district about your road.    </p>    <p>      You might also check with the title company that issued      your title report when you purchased the land. They my very      well show an easement of record that provides access.    </p>    <p>      You could also check with the U.S. Government Bureau of      Land Management (BLM). They directly oversee and keep      records on mining claims and my be able to locate records      of an access road that serves the claim.    </p>    <p>      (2) Regarding a building permit: the State of Colorado and      each county has its own set of zoning roles and building      regulations that apply to each specific area. You should      take your latest land tax bill to the county building      department to show exactly where your land is located. They      can then determine which zoning and/or other regulations      apply to your land for building purposes, and what you will      need to do to obtain a building permit. If your land is      located near Red Cliff in Eagle County, you could talk to      jean Garren in the Eagle County Planning Department. Her      phone number is (970) 328-8893. It my take a day or more to      research the regulations that apply directly to your land.      If it is in another county, you must check with that      county's building department.    </p>    <p>      (3) Water rights: unlike other property rights, water      rights are not a matter of title in many states, including      Colorado. To find out about water rights, you must contact      the State of Colorado, State Engineers Office, Division of      Water Resources, in Denver. Once you give them your legal      description, they can tell you if you have existing water      rights or if they are available and what it will take to      get them.    </p>    <p>      <em>My question a about the payment of property taxes and      the relevance, if any, of those payments to the ownership      of the property. Here's my situation:</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>My sister and I inherited a piece of property thirty      years ago. Neither of us lives on the property, nor are we      geographically near it. We live in different states. For      many years, I was struggling to survive as a single parent.      During that rime, my sister, who is single, managed the      property to the extent of paying the taxis from a fund      accumulated by the rental of a house on the property. Now      that my children are grown, I spend time once a year on the      property, maintaining the house and grounds.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I became aware that the bank account that handled the      rental income and expenses was in my sister's name only,      whereas the account itself was our joint money. After some      effort, I arranged to have the account put in both our      names, but she continues to pay the taxes from the account.      The tax bills are sent to her and tax records are in her      name only.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Recently, in order to obtain aerial views of the      property, I was asked to submit a tax receipt as proof of      ownership and, of course, I had none. Added to this, a      friend of mine says that the payment of taxes for so long      by one person gives that person some son of claim to the      land beyond our joint ownership. Could this be so? I tried      at one time to have the local tax office, where the      property is located, add my name to the tar record and to      the tax receipts. They refused and said that any question      of ownership of the property is easily answered in the will      by which we acquired it. There is no deed.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>I feel uneasy about all this and would appreciate your      advice. This is very important to me as my sister and I      view the property very differently She has wanted to sell      it but I refused. I love the land and would not want to pan      with it. I am not financially able to buy her half.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Name and address withheld<br />      New Jersey</em>    </p>    <p>      You are concerned about the possibility of a claim by your      sister through adverse possession, but that my not be too      likely. In order to make that type of claim, all of the      adverse possession requirements must be met, not simply      payment of taxes. To be sure about this, discuss it with an      attorney in the state in which the land is located.    </p>    <p>      You did not say in which state the property is located.      Determine who normally searches tide in that state and seek      advice from the entity that handles such matters. That my      be a title company, attorney, or individual belonging to a      title search association. Once you reach the right entity,      it shouldn't be too difficult to prove your co-ownership      via the will and learn how to have your name recorded as a      co-owner. You my have to pay for a consultation, but if it      is a simple matter of recording an appropriate document, it      shouldn't be too costly.    </p>    <p>      Even though you and your sister differ philosophically      regarding the land, it sounds as if she has been diligent      in trying to manage the rental and tax funds. If she wants      to sell and you can't afford to buy her share outright, you      might try offering her installment payments. Be sure to      formalize agreements with a land sales contract and record      it.    </p>    <p>      <em>Send your questions to "Country Real Estate, " c/o      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O.
