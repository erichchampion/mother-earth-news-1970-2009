                <p>      <strong>Garden and Yard</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Mulching a      Vegetable Garden.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Mort Mather    </h5>        <p>      Mulch, as a verb, is the act of applying some covering to      the soil, usually for the purpose of controlling weeds. As      a noun, it is any material that will serve the purpose. If      that sounds like a very broad range of materials, it is. I      have used mulches that were living and dead and ranged from      dust to oil. What they all accomplished-with any      luck-was:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Controlling Weeds.</strong> I can't think of a      mulch that doesn't do this if used properly. When I first      heard of clear plastic being used as a mulch, I questioned      how it would control weeds. After all, I used clear plastic      to help plants that needed heat to grow. Clear plastic used      as a mulch works to kill weeds by cooking them when the sun      comes out. Some weeds may get started in cool cloudy      weather, but one sunny day will shrivel them in a hurry.      Unfortunately, I didn't learn this by using a clear plastic      mulch. I learned it when, one sunny morning, I got to the      garden a little late to open the plastic row covers over my      eggplant and pepper seedlings. Baked seedlings were a sad      lesson but one not soon forgotten. I paid for my laziness      that year and didn't use plastic row covers for several      years after that. Then I found slitted row covers which      open up to release excess heat without my attention.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Retaining Moisture.</strong> All of the mulches I'm      going to discuss retain moisture with the arguable      exception of a living mulch. A living mulch like clover      will draw moisture from the sod for its own growth and some      of the moisture drawn by the plants will be lost to the      atmosphere through the leaves. On the other hand, a carpet      of leaves on low-growing plants that catches morning dew      and holds a cushion of air beneath it may snake up for the      moisture it uses. By cushion of air I mean that low-growing      plants, such as clover grown between rows of corn, will      shelter the soil surface from drying breezes and from the      baking sun. Whether or not the beneficial influence offsets      the moisture used is something for scientists to      investigate.    </p>    <p>      All mulches, except dust, inhibit rainfall or irrigation      from above from reaching the soil. For this reason, it is      best to mulch a soil that is already moist. Here in New      England, the spring soil is usually moist. There has been a      time or two when I held back on mulching and waited for      rain. Once an impervious mulch like plastic is put down,      there is no chance of additional moisture reaching that      soil in any quantity. It amazes me when I check the      condition of soil under a plastic mulch in mid or late      summer and find it moist below the top half inch. Where are      the plants getting sufficient water to fill out eggplant      and tomatoes? The roots have probably extended beyond the      plastic, but still, the soil under the plastic has received      no additional moisture since the end of May.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Fertilizing</strong> . All organic mulches do this.      Grass clippings provide nutrients more quickly than other      organic mulches. Sawdust is at the other end of the scale,      as it will require nitrogen from a source outside itself to      break down into usable nutrients and humus. When we put      sawdust in contact with the soil, the sod organisms      recognize a big job ahead and they multiply rapidly. To      multiply, they need nitrogen. Since it is not available in      the sawdust, they use nitrogen that is already in the soil.      If the nitrogen supply in the soil is insufficient, the      sawdust is converted more slowly. Of greater importance,      the soil is deficient in nitrogen for the plants and they      will suffer.    </p>    <p>      The most important thing to keep in mind regarding soil      fertility and mulch is the carbon-nitrogen ratio. The      carbon-nitrogen ratio of sawdust is 400:1, for example,      while young sweet clover is 12:1. An average bale of hay      might be 80:1, while rotted manure might be 20:1. A      substance that has a C:N ratio below 17:1 will actually add      nitrogen to the soil while a ratio above 33:1 will take      nitrogen from the soil. Between those two figures the      result is neutral. Grass clippings might have a ratio of      16:1 but if the plant is allowed to grow to maturity, the      ratio might go to 30:1 or 40:1. If the plant starts to dry,      the ratio goes up even more. Once dried as hay the ratio      will be in the vicinity of 80:1.    </p>    <p>      There is one other factor to keep in mind regarding the C:N      ratio. If the material is just going to be used as a mulch,      the amount of interface with the soil is limited to the      soil surface. It is when a high C:N ratio material is      incorporated into the soil that the temporary loss of      nitrogen can become severe. You may use a sawdust mulch on      a section of the garden one year and have no problems. If      you turn it under the next year, you want to stake sure to      incorporate some additional nitrogen at the same time.    </p>    <p>      Materials from trees have the potential for lowering the pH      of the soil-making it more acidic. Leaves, sawdust,      and wood shavings are acidic. However, in the process of      becoming humus, they move toward a higher pH. Also, it      seems the more humus in the soil, the wider the band on the      pH scale that is acceptable to plants. (See MOTHER x166 for      more on sod fertility.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Warming/Cooling the Soil.</strong> Clear or black      plastic mulch will warm the soil more quickly in the spring      and hold the warmth over night. In my climate, that makes a      tremendous difference with eggplant and melons and usually      a noticeable difference with peppers and tomatoes. Organic      mulches insulate the soil. Mulching crops that prefer a      cool soil like lettuce, peas, and spinach can lengthen the      harvest period or improve the harvest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Keeping Plants off the Ground.</strong> A tomato      plant can be allowed to sprawl on a cushion of heavy straw,      grass, or hay mulch and the fruit will not be the worse for      the contact. If the same tomato is allowed to rest on the      bare ground, wire worms or some other soil critters may      damage the fruit. Melons will also benefit from this      technique.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Keeping Plants Clean.</strong> Lettuce and celery      are especially prone to getting soil splashed all over      them. Not so when they are mulched with something other      than a dust mulch.    </p>            <p>      <strong>Controlling Erosion.</strong> While we are      picturing the rain drops splashing the sod up on our clean      plants just before we harvest them, let's think about the      soil. Those rain drops are falling hard on the soil and if      enough of them fall and there is any slope to the garden,      they will start to flow. That will cause erosion. Mulch can      stop erosion on any slope.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Making the Garden Attractive.</strong> Beauty is      clearly in the eye of the beholder. I think a mulched      garden is beautiful. We need some spaces in the garden for      ourselves, and I like to have my walkways covered with      mulch. There are also spaces into which plants haven't      grown yet which simply look better with a tittle covering.      Call me a prude, but I think the winter squash patch looks      better covered with mulch than showing bare exposed soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Controlling Insects</strong> . Have I ever      mentioned that I think the best way to control of insects      in a garden is to grow healthy plants in a healthy soil?      Organic mulch goes does much for the soil by providing      plants with humus. The plants are also healthier with a      steady supply of moisture available as needed. I have seen      claims that mulch interrupts the life-cycle of some      insects. That may be true, but I have not seen any evidence      of it. To be fair, I have not looked. I'm convinced that      anything good that happens is simply the result of a      healthy growing environment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preparing Soil for Planting.</strong> An organic      mulch can also be used to prepare sod for planting the next      year. Spreading it over the sod will smother the plants      underneath, making it easier to turn the soil a year later.      You'll be pleased next planting season by sod that is soft,      friable, and easy to work.    </p>    <h3>Which Mulch is Best</h3>    <p>      I'm going to start with the dead organic mulches fast. This      is the biggest category, the most common, the best for most      things, and the most likely to be the least expensive.    </p>    <p>      I have heard several stories of people who have been able      to get the municipal road crew to deliver leaves and/or      grass clippings. If you live in a place where the      municipality collects leaves and your garden is as close or      closer than the place they are planning to dump them, there      is a good chance you can get in on this free delivery      service.    </p>    <p>      Lawn-care people may also deliver for you, but there are      some things to watch out for. Sometimes the leaves or grass      clippings come with unwanted materials.    </p>    <p>      I have several bags of leaves next to the garden right now      that have enough gravel in them to make a path. I could      actually use the gravel, but separating the two is a task      that I have not found the time to do yet. I'm fond of      saying that time is a function of desire.    </p>    <p>      The other cautionary note involves grass clippings. Lawns      receive more chemicals than agricultural      fields-wonderful (he says sarcastically) mixtures of      all-purpose concoctions that will make the lawn green, kill      certain kinds of "unwanted" grasses, kill broad-leaf      plants, and kill insects. I'm not going to go into why that      is a bad idea. It would take another article. Besides, if      everyone agreed with me on lawn care there wouldn't be any      grass clippings for gardens. What we are concerned with is      keeping those chemicals out of the garden, off our hands      and clothes, and out of our house. If you are dealing with      reasonable lawn care people, they may be happy to tell you      when the lawn was last treated. After all, there are      broad-leaf plants in the garden and you wouldn't want to      unknowingly introduce a herbicide designed to kill such      plants into the garden. They would understand that      reasoning better than telling them, "I hate chemicals."    </p>    <p>      If you can't get free home delivery, you can probably find      a good neighbor hood for collecting bagged leaves and      clippings. I always ask before collecting. Even if bags are      at curbside, it is possible they are there waiting for      another gardener. Besides, talking to someone who is      bagging mulch for you may be the beginning of a treasure      trove. They may be willing to call you when they have some      good stuff and they are likely to keep the bags more pure.      You might want to heft the bags just to check the weight      before asking for them. If I had an opportunity to do that      with the leaves and gravel I have now, I would have avoided      a job.    </p>    <p>      Mast organic mulch is easy to use. The finer materials,      such as clippings and leaves, are the easiest to use. Just      spread or place them with your hands where you want them,      between four and eight inches thick. The thickness depends      on the coarseness of the material. Sawdust will smother      weeds at a couple of inches, leaves three to four, grass      clippings four to six, hay or straw eight inches. If the      materials are too coarse (such as corn stalks or sugar      cane) they should be shredded to make a good mulch or mixed      with other mulch materials. Don't obsess over the thickness      of the mulch. You are unlikely to use too much, and if you      use too little you will know when the weeds poke through      it. If that happens, just drop some more on top of the      impertinent weeds.    </p>    <p>      I generally have a variety of materials and I use them in      different places. The coarsest materials are easiest to      spread in large areas like the squash patch, between the      corn rows, and on the walkways. My favorite material is      freshly cut grass clippings that will go right where you      put them and stay there.    </p>        <p>      Grass clippings are so easy to use that when I started      market gardening, the only motorized vehicle I bought was a      riding mower and grass collector. Instead of driving      equipment around in the garden, I drove around on sod and      collected grass clippings. I had twenty rows 100 feet long      of carrots, all mulched with grass clippings. I doubt that      anyone has done that before. It really wasn't much work.      They were all mulched before the radishes that were planted      with them got their first we leaves. When I harvested the      radishes I did a little in-row weeding, and that was the      end of the care of those carrots until harvest. If I ever      have another market garden, I will do it the same way. Some      enterprising soul could develop a machine that cuts the      grass and deposits it as mulch in adjacent rows.    </p>    <p>      Bark and wood chips are popular mulches around ornamentals      and shrubs. These plantings do well in an acidic soil so      there is no concern about the wood products making the soil      too acid. Wood products break down more slowly and thus      provide less nutritive value to the soil. As a barefoot      gardener, I prefer a mulch that feels good underfoot. This      is my particular reason for not using them.    </p>    <p>      Wood shavings and sawdust are sometimes used as bedding for      animals and come mixed with manure. The manure has nitrogen      that improves the carbon-nitrogen ratio. Manure by itself      or in combination with other materials is generally not      used as a mulch. If you put it on thickly enough to smother      weeds, it will likely be too rich for the soil. The      combination of manure and straw, may be a good growing      medium for plants and while smothering seeds in the soil,      seeds in the manure mix will geminate.    </p>    <p>      The list of possible dead organic materials is long: potato      peelings, buckwheat hulls, peanut shells, egg shells,      lobster shells, feathers, hair, grapefruit skins, leather      scraps, pea pods, pine needles, prune pits, and on and on.      While some of these are exotic to most of us, they are an      easily obtained waste product for others.    </p>    <p>      There is one other that is readily available to just about      anyone. It is different from the those mentioned so far      because it is a processed organic material. Newspaper is a      wood product. It performs well as a mulch in all aspects of      other organic mulches except that it has limited nutrient      value and it doesn't look, in my opinion, as nice as      natural organic materials. I have read nothing that leads      me to believe it should not be used. The paper is OK and      the ink will not create problems in the soil or be taken up      by the plants. The best way to use newspapers is probably      to put them down on the sod first, several pages thick, and      cover them with a light natural mulch to hide them. This      will make it possible to stretch your natural mulch farther      if it is in short supply.    </p>    <p>      I have been making a distinction for dead organic mulch      because a living mulch is also providing organic material      for the soil. Living mulches work best, I think, for crops      like corn that will grow tall and not have to compete with      the mulch for sunlight. Vine crops will also do well as      they will grow above the living mulch. I have two favorite      living mulches. Clover is a legume and will actually add      nitrogen to the soil. It is also low-growing and spreads      out over the surface of the soil, blanketing it easily. It      seems like a natural for growing in corn as the corn is a      heavy nitrogen feeder.    </p>    <p>      The other favorite living mulch is weeds. Nice      strong-stemmed weeds like lambs quarters will support      tomato and squash vines, keeping the fruit off the ground.      AS they grow along with the crop, they keep the ground      covered from early in the season. They grow the structure      to support my plants. After my experience last summer,      which I'll get into in a minute, I am not sure I will use      this method again.    </p>    <p>      A dust mulch is the simplest but it also provides the      fewest positive results. Dust mulch will help the soil      retain moisture. control weeds and, perhaps, insulate the      soil slightly from temperature fluctuations. Dust is not      applied. It is created by cultivating the surface      shallowly. By loosening the soil on the surface, air spaces      are created that inhibit the capillary action that draws      moisture from below. Without the dust, the moisture on the      surface evaporates and more moisture is sucked to the      surface to be last to the air.    </p>    <p>      The "oil" I use as a mulch is in the form of plastic that      is a petroleum product. I prefer black plastic, though I      have been assured that clear plastic works just as well.      Although plastic will do just about everything an organic      mulch will do except add fertility, I use it for only one      reason: to warn the soil. Even then, I only use it for      corps that will not do well otherwise in my climate. I      could get cucumber and squash earlier if I used plastic,      but I am satisfied with the date and production of these      crops. I usually mulch them with hay that can have a      cooling effect but I don't mulch them until the plants are      up and growing, and I mulch at the end of the day when the      soil is warm.    </p>    <p>      Plastic gives me considerably letter yields of eggplant,      melons, and tomatoes. 1 think it gives me better yields of      peppers, and so I usually plant them in plastic but pepper      yields seem to operate on some cosmic scale that baffles      me.    </p>    <p>      Using plastic is fairly easy. I bought a roll years ago for      the market garden and I'm still using it. You want to he      sure to store plastic out of the sun, as sunlight      deteriorates it. I start by hoeing a trench eight or so      inches deep down the center of the row I plan to plant. I      half fill the trench with compost and then fill it in and      smooth the bed. My plastic is three feet wide but most sold      now seems to be four. I dig a six or so inch deep trench on      either side of the first trench about eight inches in from      the edges of the plastic. Then the plastic is rolled out      and the edges are tucked into the trenches and covered to      keep the plastic from blowing away. Seedlings are      transplanted through holes poked in the plastic. Be sure to      remove the plastic as soon as the plants die in the fall.      If left over winter, it is much more likely to deteriorate      and become a problem. The best method I have found for      removing it is to cut the plant sterns close to the soil      line rather than trying to pull the plants or tear the      plastic around them. Leaving the roots in the soil is a      good idea anyway.    </p>    <h3>Solving Problems</h3>        <p>      If I were as fortunate as some and had no slugs or moles or      mice, I would garden with a permanent mulch. I did for a      couple of years and loved it. It wasn't quite as simple as      that, because each year the garden got larger and I would      have someone come to till the new ground. While they were      here, I would have them till part of the old ground. There      was always some tilled ground to he dealt with each spring      it seems.    </p>    <p>      There were also the witch grass rhizomes that were in      abundance then. Tilling was necessary to get that plant un      der control. By mid-summer most of the garden had been      mulched.    </p>    <p>      Slugs were a problem. There were whole families living in      lettuce and cabbage plants. I could pull back mulch just      about anywhere and find slugs. They did considerable damage      to the pea vines one year and another year they wiped out      my late planting of lettuce when it reached an inch in      height. I used pans of beer, which do attract slugs, and      various other control methods. However, I really didn't      want to spend my life feeding slugs mulch so their      populations could explode while also trying to kill them.      The solution seemed to be less mulch.    </p>    <p>      I removed the dead organic mulch from the lettuce and      cabbage. Lettuce hates to be crowded, so a living mulch      would not work. A living mulch actually provides shade and      moisture at ground level which slugs need. I wanted to      create a desert between the slugs and my precious lettuce      and cabbage. A dust mulch was the answer. That meant,      though, that the lettuce would get dirty in a hard rain and      that it wouldn't have the benefit of the cool stable soil      temperature of mulch. It's a trade-off.    </p>    <p>      Potatoes can be planted right on top of the soil and      covered with eight inches or so of hay. It works very      well-most years. It is the other years, when the      rodents find diem, that have caused me to change my method.      Now I plant potatoes a couple of inches deep and mulch up      around them as they grow rather than hilling. It doesn't      matter if it is soil or mulch that protects them from the      sun just so the sun doesn't touch the tubers.    </p>    <p>      Rats and mice have occasionally gotten into my carrots and      potatoes in the fall. This usually happens after a section      has been under mulch for a couple of years. when it becomes      a problem, 1 usually till a major .section of the garden      the following spring to disrupt their tunnels, nests, and      to let them know this is not a good place to tell home.    </p>    <p>      Two years ago, moles became a serious problem. They are      insectivores so 1 wasn't worried about the plants this time      but rather about the earthworms which are at the core of my      fertilization plan. I put up a vibrating windmill that was      supposed to drive them away. It didn't. I put out traps,      also to no avail.    </p>    <p>      Last spring, virtually any place in the garden where I      pushed my hand into the soil, it would drop through a mole      run. With all that air in the soil, it was quite possible      roots would be affected. Worse, where a shovel would      usually turn up a couple dozen worms, now there might be      shovels-full of soil with no worms. I had two-thirds of the      garden tilled. The mole runs that we see in our lawns and      gardens are where they eat. Their homes are dug deeper,      below the tines of the tiller.    </p>    <p>      I took up mulch in some places. I used a living mulch in      the corn instead of hay, which I prefer. The moles left in      early summer to aerate the front lawn. I don't think they      left because of anything I did. I think they ate most of      the worms and moved on in search of more food.    </p>    <p>      By fall the earthworm population was up to a respectable      level again. The moles, however, have circumnavigated the      house and are headed back toward the garden. I don't have      the answer to this little problem yet. I'm thinking about a      moat.    </p>    <p>      Using less dead organic mulch left more of the garden open      for weeds to grow. I am going to be more careful about      letting weeds go to seed in the garden. That is why I am      probably not going to use a living mulch of weeds to      support squash or tomatoes. Of course, if weeds get away      from me to the squash or tomato patch, you can count on me      to claim I planned it that way.    </p>
