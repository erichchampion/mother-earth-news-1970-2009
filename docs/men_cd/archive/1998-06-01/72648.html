                <p>      <strong>Country Skills</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Dr. Jack's amazingly easy and effective garden      fence.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Dr. Jack Pedersen    </h5>        <p>      For years, Maggie would suddenly spring up from her snooze      and demand to be let outside at once, for unknown dog      reasons. When she died at 13 1 / 2 -antique for a      Doberman-we were suddenly confronted with a herd of      at least six does and a buck or to two that traveled our      neighborhood, sampling at will. Besides the beans, beets,      and tomato plants, we lost onions, garlic, strawberry      plants, and even hot chilies, to blatant deer nibbling.      They also ate the fruit trees and blueberry bushes. It      became clear the old dog had, in fact been doing her job in      keeping such critters away.    </p>    <p>      I had been searching over the years for the perfect wonder      fence, one that would solve the problem of deer and other      varmints making oft with the actual fruits of our labor.      Every sample design I found had more disadvantages than      advantages. The Bureau of Reclamation and the Forestry      Service both had a wonderful, nearly indestructible design      However, these violated several of my requirements. I      wanted to build the most effective fence, at the lowest      cost, with the least amount of labor- <em>that wasn't      ugly</em> . Based upon my research over the years, and      adding a few modifications of my own. I finally managed to      come up with a winner It has stood the last three years      against the combined efforts of rabbits, deer, dogs and      cats, possum, raccoons, wild turkeys, pheasant, and the      neighbors' chickens and goats.    </p>    <p>      Our garden spot is 50' by 50', giving us 2,500 square feet.      This spot, along with multiple berry beds and fruit trees,      produces enough to last the two of us through a year. We      have seen what happens if the garden is left without      protection. We have also seen the ugly home-construction      fences that blight the countryside year-round. My fence can      be taken down in about an hour at the end of the season and      stored in a space smaller than a wheelbarrow. It goes up      after final tilling in the spring in about an hour or two.      If you site your posts properly, they can stay in the      ground year round.    </p>                <p>      Initial cost is around $200 if you have to buy the charger.      Often times, used units hide out at yard sales and junk      shops. You can reconfigure the shape of the fence, and the      replacement cost in materials and labor is minimal. The      second year, I spent about $5, and the third year, due to      upgraded redesigns, I had to add another roll of galvanized      ( <em>not</em> aluminum) wire and some extra insulators,      for a total of under $20. You can modify my design to your      own configuration, as long as you heed a few basics.      Shopping around for the best prices is part of the fun.      (See sidebar for a list of supplies and costs.)    </p>    <p>      The secret of the fence design lies in the incorporation of      a fundamental understanding of just how clever deer can be.      While deer can jump amazingly high, <em>or</em> amazingly      far, they cannot jump both far and high at the same time.      While my fence is only about 6 1 / 2 tall, the angle of the      support posts make it effectively much higher, as the      offset width between top and bottom strand is about 3'.      When they are close to the lower wire, the top wire is      directly overhead and they cannot clear the top wire. When      they are in position to jump the top wire, they are too far      away to clear the bottom on the inside. They will not jump      blindly. I found I could fake them out if I extended a      white fiberglass rod about 2' above the middle, between the      corner posts. They seemed to consider the height increased      by that amount. One of the secrets is to make it appear      that your fence is more of a barrier than it actually is.    </p>    <p>      Without the electrical charger, this design a doomed to      failure sooner or later. Without the necessary visual      guides, eventually some buck will knock a wire or two down      and happily graze on your goodies. The proper "post-set" is      a vertical short post and an angled long post. These have      to be connected together to stabilize each other. The 6'      post is driven to 4'; the 10' is inserted about 3' toward      the opposite corner post, then driven in at a 45°      angle. There is about 3' angling out above the vertical      post.    </p>        <p>      I drove the 6' posts in with a regular post driver in the      comers of a 50' by 50' square. The 10' posts are angled at      45°, and have a hole drilled so the posts can be      bottled together. You can square your garden spot by making      the four sides equal, then make the diagonals equal to each      other. Actually, I missed this part, so I have an irregular      polygon, but the fence is so adaptable it didn't matter. I      have seen this same basic design keep out cows and even      elk. That fence was 100' by 30' using only four more      post-sets.    </p>    <p>      I used a common metal squeeze-link to stabilize the      post-pairs. Place your bottom insulators about the height      of a possum's back, or whatever your smallest invaders may      be, and stretch each section of this first line around the      insulators as you unroll the wire around the periphery.      Measure up about 12" for each of the remaining wires. You      can construct a more elaborate gate, but I used just the      insulated handles for attachment to the special insulator      with the wire connector built in. Connect the hot wire from      the charger in parallel to each fence wire. Ground your      charger well. I mounted mine on a post and used an old      plastic washbasin screwed to the post with drywall screws      to protect against rain. The following year, I bought a      translucent plastic container so I could see the charger      (lash, and I used the lid as a small porch roof to keep the      water out of the upper edge. Now, as we pull our garden      produce from the freezer all winter, we take special pride      in the knowledge that we are more clever than deer.    </p>
