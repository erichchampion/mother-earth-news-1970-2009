        <p>When AAA made news for lobbying against mass transit and the Clean Air Act, Todd Silberman and Mitch Rofsky recognized the need for an eco-friendly alternative and created the Better World Club (BWC). BWC provides 24/7 roadside assistance, from lockouts and jump starts to gas delivery and towing, in all 50 states. Their environmental stewardship efforts include a roadside assistance plan for bicycles and a 15 percent discount on new memberships for owners of hybrid and biodiesel vehicles. They make it easy and convenient to reduce your carbon footprint, using their TravelCool! carbon offset program for journeys by car or air. Plus, $1 from every travel booking is donated to the purchase of offsets - and BWC donates 1 percent of their revenue to environmental cleanup and advocacy.
