        Although Toyota chose not to continue production of its all-electric RAV4, electric cars make sense to the people who own them, such as actor Ed Begley Jr. “My Toyota RAV4 EV handles great,” he says. “It’s the perfect car for around town, and the batteries are in perfect shape after nearly five years and 50,000 miles. The best thing is I get to fuel it with solar power from my rooftop.”
