        <p>Most of us have experienced short-term power outages due to spring thunderstorms and have learned we can get through a day without power. But imagine a blackout that lasts several days. Such prolonged power outages are a real possibility after a serious hurricane or winter storm, especially for rural folks who often are last in line to get their power restored. Ease your mind by preparing a simple and inexpensive emergency preparedness kit.</p><p><strong>Water</strong><br />The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) recommends having 2 quarts per person per day for drinking water, and 2 quarts per person per day for washing, flushing toilets and other purposes. Save water for sanitation purposes in plastic jugs that have been cleaned with hot, soapy water.</p><p>Drinking water requires more exacting storage. Commercially produced bottled water lasts for a year when stored in a cool, dark place. But you don’t have to buy bottled water. Instead, store your own in thoroughly cleaned 2-liter plastic bottles, which are better than milk jugs because the plastic is thicker and less likely to leak. Glass bottles with screw-on caps are great, too.</p><p><strong>Food<br /></strong>Set aside cabinet space or a storage bin to store emergency food reserves. Your stash could include canned soups, meats, nuts, fruits and vegetables; unopened peanut butter and jelly; dried fruits and vegetables; crackers and hard candy. When stored in airtight containers, these foods will keep for a year.</p><p><strong>Cooking</strong><br />With a wood- or gas-powered cookstove, you’ll still be able to cook when the grid goes down. But if you have an electric stove, you'll probably want to include a portable stove in your emergency disaster kit.</p><p>Numerous portable cookstoves are available for outdoor use, but most of them are not safe for indoor use. Just as with portable space heaters, always check the instructions before you use any stove indoors.</p><p><strong>Light<br /></strong>If you plan to rely on flashlights or electric lanterns for emergency lighting, be sure to keep plenty of fresh batteries on hand. Or avoid the expense of replacing batteries by using a flashlight that can be recharged by cranking or shaking.</p><p>Kerosene lamps are a traditional non-electric light source, and Aladdin mantle lamps will provide more light than simple wick-type lanterns. Candles are an inexpensive and easy-to-store lighting option, but to be safe, use them with glass chimneys. And for your emergency kit, you may want to choose longer-lasting products such as the NUWICK 120-hour candle.</p><p><strong>Communication</strong><br />The ability to communicate with family, friends and the outside world is critical during an emergency. If only the electricity is out, hard-wired phones will continue to work, but cell phones will work only if the service provider’s towers have backup generators. Also consider purchasing a battery-operated radio to keep abreast of weather warnings.</p>
