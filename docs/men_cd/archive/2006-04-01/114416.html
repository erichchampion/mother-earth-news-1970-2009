                    <h3>      We raise poultry to produce the most nutritious eggs, and      we teach others how to do the same. By Lisa Jansen Mathews    </h3>            <p>      <strong>M</strong>y husband, Kevin, and I live on a small      farm in northern California named Far Out Farms. Although      our property is only two and a half acres, its large enough      to produce several cash crops, including apples and      supernutritious eggs from pastured chickens and ducks.    </p>    <p>      We moved here seven years ago, but I first saw the property      at least a decade before, when my two young sons and I      drove by on the way to our favorite state park. We saw an      old sign for the Far Out House hanging in a cedar tree at      the driveway gate. The property was so heavily forested      that we couldnt see the house from the road, but there was      a hand-painted hippie bus parked outside. For fun, we made      up stories as we drove by. We pretended that the Far Out      House was everything from a hideout for secret agents to a      nudist commune.    </p>    <p>      I was a single parent for many years, but the boys are      grown up now. One day, one of my sons introduced me to      Kevin, an older friend he worked with. Sparks flew, and      Kevin and I got married. Shortly afterward, he noticed that      the Far Out House was for sale. Kevin had heard my sons      stories about the house, and just for fun, he grabbed a      real estate flier and brought it home. His jaw dropped when      I started seriously scanning the flier. Six months later,      the Far Out House was ours.    </p>    <p>      It didnt take much to stir my farming genes. My family has      been farming in California for more than 100 years, ever      since 1889, when my great-grandfather and his two younger      brothers came over from Germany. They purchased a 40-acre      farm that supported our family for several generations. I      discovered my own love of growing crops in junior college,      when I paid my way through school by working in the college      greenhouse. Since then, I have gardened on campuses, in      wading pools and in the grassy strips between parking lots.      I love being able to feed my friends and family from any      available patch of dirt, but when we purchased the Far Out      House, it was my first chance to raise food on a larger      scale.    </p>            <p>      <strong>Fixing up the Farm</strong>    </p>    <p>      The first thing we did after purchasing the property was to      hit the books and learn more about rural living. The house      is so far out of town that it is completely off the      electrical grid, and everything on the property is      solar-powered. We knew we would have a lot of work to do      because the property was unkempt and generally run-down, so      we read about wells and pumps, sewage systems, generators      and solar power.    </p>    <p>      The Far Out House was not built for beauty; its builders      had function and conservation in mind. To the best of      anyones memory, the house was built in the 60s. The lumber      was milled on-site from cedar trees cut from the property.      All the windows and fixtures are secondhand. There are no      bedrooms, only sleeping lofts accessible by ladder. The      previous owners added a kitchen and dining room in the 70s,      and a small office and a bathroom sometime during the 80s.    </p>    <p>      The fixtures are even older than the house. The bathtub is      from 1915, the bathroom sink from 1941 and the cookstove      from about 1930. The property also has numerous      outbuildings, including a small, rustic cabin. Our six      75-watt solar panels were here when we moved in, and they      have been very dependable, requiring minimal maintenance.    </p>    <p>      I have been asked many times, How did the Far Out House get      its name For years we did not know. We thought it could      have been inspired by the popular 60s phrase far out, or      possibly by its long distance from any town. Just recently,      a long-time neighbor cleared up the mystery. He said the      original owners came up with the name because the outhouse      was so far from the house!    </p>    <p>      As we began cleaning, painting, repairing, pruning and      raking the property, I realized how much we could do even      with this small amount of land. We began by selling apples      from the orchard, farm-fresh chicken eggs and campfire      wood. Fortunately, our property is located next to a      campground, so we have a steady stream of customers who      enjoy coming to the farm.    </p>    <p>      A year later, we began selling duck eggs to two local      stores I had bought the ducks purely for enjoyment, but I      soon found that we had many customers who were eager to buy      them. In British, Chinese and Japanese cooking, duck eggs      are often used instead of chicken eggs. I also raised geese      and sold their eggs for a short time, but discovered that      geese require more space than we had available, so I gave      them to a friend with a larger pond.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Raising Healthy Animals</strong>    </p>    <p>      My grandfather always said that farm animals should be      given a good life. Practices such as locking birds in small      cages or feeding them stale bakery goods an ingredient in      some poultry feeds just did not meet Grandpas standards. I      wanted to raise our chickens and ducks with access to green      pastures and sunshine. Our heavily forested land had little      pasture space, but we increased it by pruning and thinning      some of the trees. Old apple trees, maples, pines, madrones      and cedars perked up while the sun warmed the soil, and the      natural grasses began to revive.    </p>    <p>      In college I majored in nutrition, so I began applying that      knowledge to raising poultry. I have been studying how the      nutrient content of eggs is influenced by what the birds      eat. According to the latest research, eggs from      pasture-fed birds are lower in cholesterol and higher in      vitamin A and vitamin E. (For more information, visit The      Chicken and Egg Page at www.MotherEarthNews.com/eggs.      Mother) The eggs also contain more omega-3 fatty acids,      which are essential for heart health. Our eggs are      lab-tested for their fatty acid content, and the results      are the benchmark I use to make feed and management      choices. We cant keep up with the demand for our      omega-3-enriched chicken and duck eggs. Last year we sold      about 700 dozen eggs, at $3.25 a dozen for chicken eggs and      $3.50 a dozen for duck eggs.    </p>    <p>      When we started raising poultry, I began to experiment with      different pasture grasses and seed mixtures. Using the      right seed mix in a pasture where you keep free-range birds      will increase the omega-3 content of your flocks eggs.      Peaceful Valley Farm and Garden Supply sells one of my      omega-3 seed mixes in its catalog. Some of the seeds I am      currently using in the pasture include purslane, clovers,      vetch, alfalfa, cowpeas, mung beans, flax, oats, buckwheat      and teff.    </p>    <p>      Our hens eat as much wild food as is available pasture      grasses, seeds and bugs and then we supplement their diet      with high-quality organic feed. The ducks eat a mixture of      grasses, vegetables and commercial waterfowl food. We dont      push egg production with antibiotics. Our birds live long      lives, and I believe keeping the birds healthy leads to      more nutritious eggs and a longer production cycle.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Lifelong Learning</strong>    </p>    <p>      After we began selling eggs, I started getting questions      from other owners of small flocks, ranging from Do I need a      rooster to get eggs (the answer is no) to Why do my ducks      lay soft-shelled eggs (often the problem is diet chicken,      turkey or wild-game food does not meet the nutritional      needs of waterfowl).    </p>    <p>      I decided there was more than enough interest to teach a      poultry-care class, and I now offer a regular course that      teaches everything from making inexpensive brooding cages      to postmortem examinations. We also offer longer-term,      hands-on learning. These guests stay for a few days in our      cabin; some of them come to stay because they are      interested in our egg production system, and some want to      learn more about solar power and rural living.    </p>    <p>      Guests at the cabin begin each morning with two fried eggs      one chicken egg and one duck egg. Many of our guests claim      they do not like duck eggs, but then decide theyre      delicious after trying them.    </p>    <p>      Next, the guests come along on my morning rounds, so we      head to the duck pond in waders and gloves. We discuss      bloom, a natural coating on the egg that acts as a barrier      to bacteria. Then we move on to the chicken coop. We      discuss keeping nest boxes clean and how to keep roosters      separated so they wont fight. Someone always asks about the      two ducks living with the chickens. We have a Buff      Orpington hen that hatched two Indian Runner ducks, Hansel      and Grettle, who insist they are chickens!    </p>    <p>      The year 2002 brought some serious changes in my life. I      had two strokes followed by 10 months of seizures. I      thought my farming days had come to an end. I struggled to      walk, my speech was impaired, and my memory and recognition      abilities were damaged. But slowly, I have returned to      farming, employing adapted techniques. I never would have      guessed it the first time I saw the Far Out House, but this      place has had a profound impact on my life. Living here has      not only put me in touch with my farming roots, it has      given me incentive to heal.    </p>    <p>      Farming is in my blood and in my soul. I have long been      convinced that, as a culture, our nutrition can be no      better than our farming practices. This farm is an ongoing      science class. Right now, we are working on increasing the      conjugated linoleic acid content in the eggs and trying new      types of forage. Here, on this tiny piece of the planet, I      have a place to test my theories and live my dreams.    </p>            <p>      Visit www.faroutfarms.com to learn more about Lisa Jansen      Mathews farm and poultry-care workshops.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Proof that Pastured Eggs are Better      </h3>      <p>        The flavor and nutrient content of eggs from poultry        raised on pasture is superior to that of eggs from caged        birds.
