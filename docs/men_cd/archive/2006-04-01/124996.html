CHOOSE AN EFFICIENT RIDE</b><br />by Bryan Welch, Publisher</h4><br /><br />Before you plunk down a lot of dough on a new hybrid car, considerwhether a used motorcycle might be more fun and might get you moretotal miles per gallon. I love my 1988 BMW K75S. It cost me about$3,000 and gets about 60 miles per gallon. I can't ride it everyday, but when I average it out with my car, my overall mpg isterrific!<br /><br /><h4><b>2. SUSTAINABLE LAWN CARE (AND FREE ORGANICFERTILIZER)</b><br />by Cheryl Long, Editor in Chief</h4><br /><br />Conventional American lawn care is about as unsustainable as youcan get. First, people buy expensive fertilizer that makes thegrass grow faster, which means they have to mow more often. Thenthey send the nutrient-rich grass clippings to the landfill, ratherthan leaving them to decompose and return nutrients to the soil.Plus, most people tend to mow their grass too short, making iteasier for weeds to move in. Here's a better way: Fertilizesparingly if at all, leave the clippings on the lawn, and cut yourgrass high.<br /><br />You can help further reduce the amount of yard waste sent tolandfills by using the bags of clippings that your neighbors putout with their trash. The clippings are rich in nitrogen and othernutrients and make a great organic garden fertilizer (be surethey're herbicide-free). A 1- to 2-inch layer of fresh clippingsapplied once a year will provide plenty of slow-release nutrientsfor most crops. Plus, the clippings do double duty as a great mulchto prevent weeds and conserve soil moisture.<br /><br /><h4><b>3. CHECK TIRE PRESSURE; IMPROVE FUEL ECONOMY</b><br />by John Rockhold, Managing Editor</h4><br /><br />One of the easiest ways to maximize your car's gas mileage ? andmake a significant difference for the environment ? is to maintainthe correct tire pressure. Seasonal temperature changes and normalwear and tear cause tires to lose pressure, which can cut fueleconomy by up to 5 percent ? costing you an extra $50 to $100 ayear, depending on your vehicle's mpg. If every American drove withproperly inflated tires, we would annually save 1 to 2 billiongallons of gasoline and slash global warming emissions by as muchas 20 million tons, according to the<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/" target="_blank">Union of ConcernedScientists</a>.<br /><br />So resolve to check your tire pressure at least once a month. Do sowhen the tires are 'cold' ? before you drive or after driving lessthan a mile. For the recommended inflation level, check yourowner's manual or look for a sticker on or near the doorjamb of thedriver's door (don't use the number that's on the tire itself).Simple gauges the size of a pencil cost a couple bucks, moreaccurate digital gauges cost $20 or more. I keep a gauge in myglove compartment and check the pressure every other time I getgas.<br /><br /><h4><b>4. TURN YOUR GARBAGE INTO GREAT GARDEN SOIL</b><br />by Megan Phelps, Senior Associate Editor</h4><br /><br />For an easy way to reduce the waste you send to the landfill, trycomposting! Composting transforms your kitchen scraps and yardwaste into nutrient-rich garden soil. To get started, all you needis a simple compost bin or tumbler. Then add a mix of 'browns' (dryleaves, straw, dirt) and 'greens' (grass clippings, vegetable foodscraps). Add water to keep the compost moist, and occasionally stirit up to keep it aerated. You can learn more about<a href="http://www.MotherEarthNews.com/library/1997_February_March/What_s_in_the_Heap" target="_blank">how to compost</a> from the <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> archive.<br /><br /><h4><b>5. STOP JUNK MAIL</b><br />by Scott Hollis, Associate Editor</h4><br /><br />If you get large amounts of unwanted advertising through the mail,you can reduce this wasteful and annoying 'junk mail' byregistering your name and address with the Mail Preference Servicesponsored by the Direct Marketing Association. Once you register,many (but not all) companies will remove your name from theirmailing lists and after a few months you will receive lessunsolicited mail. To register for this free service, go to<a href="http://www.dmaconsumers.org/offmailinglist.html" target="_blank">www.dmaconsumers.org</a>.<br /><br /><h4><b>6. PROGRAM YOUR FURNACE TO SAVE</b><br />by Charles Higginson, Associate Editor</h4><br /><br />You can cut heating and cooling costs dramatically with asuperefficient tool, the programmable thermostat. The simplestmodels cost as little as $35 ? less than some standard thermostats? and can work with conventional heating and cooling systems andsome heat pumps. Set the thermostat to hit target temperatures whenyou're home and to pull back by 8 to 10 degrees while you're awayor sleeping. In a typical home, that could reduce fuel use by 10percent, reducing annual carbon dioxide emissions by about 1,000pounds and cutting annual utility bills by $100. If you can operatea screwdriver, you can install a programmable thermostat in lessthan half an hour. Set it, forget it and save!<br /><br /><h4><b>7. A WIN-WIN APPROACH TO EATING</b><br />by Tabitha Alterman, Associate Editor</h4><br /><br />The average American meal travels 1,500 to 2,500 miles before it isconsumed. It's not hard to imagine how much it would cost us tomake that trip, but when the supermarket is just a few blocks awayit's easy to forget about the environmental costs of all that fuelconsumption. Meanwhile, I've been witnessing an encouraginggrass-roots movement: The number of farmer's markets in the UnitedStates has increased more than 900 percent since the 1970s. Sowhat's happening? <i>People are eating locally.</i><br /><br />By purchasing food from as close to home as possible, you can helpreduce America's addiction to oil while giving the environment amuch-needed break. Plus, when farmers sell directly to consumers,they are able to keep all the profits. (Typically, only about 20percent of the money we spend on food trickles down to the farmerswho actually grow it.) To find food produced near you, check out<a href="http://www.localharvest.org" target="_blank">Local Harvest</a> and enteryour ZIP code.<br /><br /><h4><b>8. SAVE WITH COMPACT FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULBS</b><br />by Heidi Hunt, Assistant Editor</h4><br /><br />Replacing your standard incandescent light bulbs withsuperefficient compact fluorescent light bulbs (CFLs) can decreaseyour overall home energy use and save you money in the long run.CFLs cost a little more upfront (prices start at about $3), but usea quarter of the electricity of comparable incandes cents, and lastup to 13 times longer.<br /><br />Replacing a standard 75-watt incandescent 'long-life' bulb (whichlasts about 1,500 hours) with an equally bright 20-watt CFL (whichlasts about 12,000 hours) can save you more than $50 over theeight-year life of the CFL. If you replace just five standard lightbulbs with CFLs, you could save more than $250. This is one simplething you can do for yourself <i>and</i> the Earth. CFLs areavailable almost anywhere you find standard light bulbs.<br /><br /><h4><b>9.

REUSE AND RECYCLE E-TRASH</b><br />by Katie Moyer, Editorial Intern</h4><br /><br />Twenty to 50 million tons of electronic products are discardedworldwide every year. In addition to the bulk of this e-waste,there are toxic substances ? such as lead, chromium and mercury ?in computers, cell phones, televisions and other electronics thatcan contaminate our soil and water.<br /><br />Do your part to reduce and recycle e-waste: Sell or donate yourunwanted cell phone; donate your old computer to a local school orcontact the manufacturer for recycling information; take your oldelectronics to a local drop-off or community recyclingcenter.<br /><br />Find the nearest electronics recycling organization by visitingthese Web sites:<br /><a href="http://www.iaer.org/search" target="_blank">International Association ofElectronics Recyclers</a><br /><a href="http://www.earth911.org" target="_blank">Earth 911</a><br /><a href="http://www.eiae.org" target="_blank">EIA Consumer EducationInitiative</a><br /><br /><br /><b><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/cgi-bin/udt/im.send.story.prompt?client_id=motherearthliving&story_id=195" target="_blank">MAKE A DIFFERENCE:</a></b> Send these Earth Day tips to yourfriends and family.<br /><br /><b><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/cgi-bin/udt/um.register.account?avail_publications=2&user_publications=2&client_id=motherearthliving&user_pref_email=enter+your+e-mail&submit.x=30&submit.y=7&submit=submit" target="_blank">ENJOY TIPS LIKE THESE EVERY WEEK:</a></b> Twice a week, MotherEarth Living provides short, practical tips via e-mail.
