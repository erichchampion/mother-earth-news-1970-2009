                    <h3>      Homesteading is all about living in a more hands-on,      meaningful way.    </h3>    <p>      Many of us dream of finding the perfect piece of land where      we can grow big gardens, raise chickens or goats, build a      solar-powered home or otherwise pursue our individual      visions of “the good life.” This kind of      self-reliant lifestyle is sometimes called homesteading.      It’s all about choosing to live in a more meaningful,      hands-on sort of way.    </p>    <p>      Growing healthy, nutritious food is a vital part of the      homesteading life. Rather than relying on food from a      supermarket, produced by strangers thousands of miles away,      we can enjoy the bounty of our own gardens and share it      with friends and neighbors. By growing food in a greenhouse      and preserving it by canning or freezing, we can eat      homegrown food year-round.    </p>    <p>      Many homesteaders want to build their own homes. Some want      to create their own energy from the sun, the trees and the      wind. This kind of work can be deeply satisfying because it      allows us to learn new skills, and to live more      conscientiously?- and more consciously.    </p>    <p>      Although homesteading is often associated with rural      living, you don’t need to buy land in the country to      enjoy a more self-sufficient life: You can create your own      food, shelter and energy wherever you live. Even with a      small yard in the city or suburbs, you can plant a garden      and learn to preserve food. Fruit trees can be planted      almost anywhere, and many towns and cities will even allow      you to put up solar panels, try out new building      techniques, or raise chickens and rabbits.    </p>    <p>      This issue includes six articles to help you pursue your      homesteading dreams:<br />      • “Plan the Perfect Homestead,”<br />      • “Build a Pond,”<br />      • “Fish Farming,”<br />      • “Our Far-out Free-range eggs,”<br />      • “Discover Versatile Compact      Tractors,”<br />      • “Choosing and Training a Watchdog,”    </p>        <p>      In our interconnected world, no one is completely      self-sufficient, but living a more self-reliant lifestyle      can be a rich and rewarding experience. Where better to      focus your time and energy than on the particular place you      call home    </p>    <p>      -Mother    </p>
