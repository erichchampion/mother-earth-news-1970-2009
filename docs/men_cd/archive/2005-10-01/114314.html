                    <h3>      Hit the water with this easy-to-build rowboat.    </h3>        <p>      <strong>A</strong>s Water Rat noted in The Wind in the      Willows, “There is nothing-absolutely      nothing-half so much worth doing as simply ?messing      about in boats.” Mother’s Basic Boat is a      simple boat plan, which should be easy to construct for      those with woodworking experience. To purchase more      detailed plans, with instructions for constructing an      optional sail.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cut out The Pieces.</strong>    </p>    <p>      All you’ll need to build the boat are a few tools and      the materials listed at right. The large pieces of the boat      will be cut from plywood, and reinforced with pieces of      hardwood lumber. You can cut the 170 feet of lumber you      will need from three 10-foot lengths of 1-by-8 stock, or      use any scrap hardwood lumber cut to 11/8-inch-wide boards.      (For a sketch of the completed boat.    </p>    <p>      Start by drawing an alignment line for the midship      bulkhead, which forms the central support for the boat,      across the sheet of plywood 3 feet 61/2 inches from the      stern end, as shown in Figure A. Now select one of your      long pieces of lumber, which you will use to draw the      ship’s curve. Start by drawing the left side piece.      Mark the midway point of the length of the strip on the      piece and center the strip on edge over the midship      alignment line. Next, use a C-clamp to secure the strip      over the outside center clamp position located one-eighth      inch in from the plywood’s edge. (Clamp positions are      marked on the diagram with a “C”.)    </p>    <p>      With a friend’s help, gradually bend the ends of the      strip in until its outside surface can be clamped at the      two other outer clamping positions. Now trace along the      outer surface of the ship’s curve to form an arc that      intersects all three points. Move the piece of lumber to      the inner set of clamp positions, again aligning its center      point to the midship line. Bow the strip around to      intersect the three points and secure it with clamps.      Again, draw the arc along the ship’s curve, then add      the slant of the bow and stern as shown in Figure A. Use a      saber saw to carefully cut around the boat’s      sidewall. Use the flopped first piece as a pattern to cut      out the right sidewall.    </p>    <p>      Going on to the second plywood sheet, use your hardwood      strip “ruler” to draw the boat’s bottom,      employing the same bend-and-trace technique used when      drawing the sides. Then, cut out the bottom, leaving a      surplus of 11/2 to 2 inches around the pattern on the sides      and at the bow. It will be trimmed away later. With that      done, you can cut out the second side and the transoms, and      also draw and cut out the midship bulkhead.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Assembling the Boat</strong>    </p>    <p>      Next, you’ll put together the support frames for the      bow transom (front of the boat), stern transom (back of the      boat) and midship bulkhead (center support) and attach them      to the boat sides. Start by gluing and screwing the      hardwood support strips, and the cut-to-fit motor-mount      brace, to the front and rear transoms and the central      support, using the No. 6 wood screws set at 3-inch      intervals. The upper support strips for the front and rear      transoms will be trimmed to match the angles of the bow and      stern (see Figures C and D). Simply use a sliding bevel to      measure the appropriate angle on the bottom panel-use      the pattern lines, not the “hem”-then set      your saw’s miter gauge to that angle and trim away.    </p>    <p>      Use glue and 3-inch-spaced No. 6 wood screws to secure the      two sides to the midship bulkhead, which should be      positioned 3 feet 61/2 inches from the boat’s stern.      Then, swing in the sides and, starting with the stern      transom, glue and screw the side panels to the stern      transom support frame-again setting the screws at      3-inch intervals. You might want to loop a rope around the      two sides at a point near the front to keep them from      spreading too much while you do this. Now, secure the sides      to the bow transom in the same manner and let the glue dry      for the full recommended time period.    </p>    <p>      After the glue has dried, you’ll need at least 20      clamps to secure hardwood support strips to the bottom      edges of the two sides. Start by finding the two 10-foot      chines, which you will attach to the bottom of the boat      (see Figure F). Clamp one along the bottom edge of each      sidewall. Start at the rear, allowing the chine to extend      past the stern transom a few inches, then gradually work      your way to the bow, applying clamps every 10 inches or so.      Once the chines are clamped in place, anchor them from the      outside at 3-inch intervals with the No. 6 wood screws. To      add a little extra holding power, screw in a No. 8 fastener      from the outside at each of the six butt joints between the      sidewalls, transoms and bulkhead. After the glue has set,      trim the excess length from the chines.    </p>    <p>      Now it’s time to attach the bottom of the boat. Apply      a continuous coating of glue around the frame, then      position the bottom, finished side up, over the hull so      that the midship alignment marks line up. Secure the bottom      plate to the chines, transoms and bulkhead from the outside      with No. 6 fasteners at 3-inch intervals.    </p>    <p>      Use glue and 3-inch-spaced No. 6 wood screws to secure the      two sides to the midship bulkhead, which should be      positioned 3 feet 61/2 inches from the boat’s stern.      Then, swing in the sides and, starting with the stern      transom, glue and screw the side panels to the stern      transom support frame-again setting the screws at      3-inch intervals. You might want to loop a rope around the      two sides at a point near the front to keep them from      spreading too much while you do this. Now, secure the sides      to the bow transom in the same manner and let the glue dry      for the full recommended time period.    </p>    <p>      After the glue has dried, you’ll need at least 20      clamps to secure hardwood support strips to the bottom      edges of the two sides. Start by finding the two 10-foot      chines, which you will attach to the bottom of the boat      (see Figure F). Clamp one along the bottom edge of each      sidewall.

Apply      a continuous coating of glue around the frame, then      position the bottom, finished side up, over the hull so      that the midship alignment marks line up. Secure the bottom      plate to the chines, transoms and bulkhead from the outside      with No. 6 fasteners at 3-inch intervals.    </p>    <p>      With the bottom in place, carefully trim the excess plywood      from the edges, then glue and clamp the four bottom support      strips along the length of the hull, as shown in Figure F.      Then flip the skiff over, and from the inside, fasten the      strips with No. 6 wood screws set 3 inches on center. Next,      attach the gunwales (top support strips) to the top of each      side of the boat, just as you attached the chines to the      bottom of each side.    </p>
