        <div class="sidebar"><p><strong>Secure Compost Bin</strong></p><p>My 4-by-4-foot open, wooden compost bin worked well for years, but the compost material was heavy to turn. When we rescued a dog from the local animal shelter and discovered that she liked to dig into the compost bin, we knew we needed a more secure compost system.</p><p>I discovered these 22-gallon barrels, with holes in the sides and lids, at the hardware store and purchased two. I feel as if I have built a better mousetrap. I throw kitchen scraps-along with leaves, wood chips, lawn clippings and soil-into the barrels. Last summer, I made 12 bins of compost (about 260 gallons).</p><p>The bins sit in the sun and “cook” fast, breaking down the organic material; the holes provide necessary aeration; the barrels are easily moved around the garden on a trolley or handcart; and rain can get in through the holes in the lids. I also drilled several drainage holes in the bottoms for the excess fluid to escape, and put the bins on bricks to keep them from sinking into the ground. In winter, I move them close to the house.</p><p>These compost barrels are ideal for a family that generates small amounts of garbage. They are compact, rodent- and dog-proof and not unsightly even in the smallest</p></div><p></p><hr /><strong>Reusable Freezer Containers</strong><p>You can make excellent food-quality freezer containers from 1- or 2-quart cardboard milk cartons. Cut off the top of a carton and cut down the sides to form flaps. We have found that they can be reused if the contents are first put into a plastic bag. Remember to leave expansion space for freezing. A closure tab on the cover is optional. Just seal the carton with regular masking tape and a label.</p><p>Bob and Mitzie Langevin<br />Chesterville, Maine</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Recycle Shredded Paper</strong><p>We shred our paper instead of adding to the landfill. I keep two piles, one for private or confidential material and the other for junk mail.</p><p>The shredded confidential paper is fed to our worms. They recycle it into the best fertilizer-great for the garden and especially for house plants. The shredded junk mail we use as packing material instead of Styrofoam peanuts or bubble wrap, and the package recipient can use the shredded paper in his/her compost pile, as well.</p><p>Neil Jacob<br />Ambler, Pennsylvania</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Dogs Dig Dirt</strong><p>Our border collie/German shepherd puppies are great, but they seemed to dig holes in the same location no matter what we did. We tried bitter spray deterrents, hot peppers, scolding them, positive reinforcement and other methods, but none of them seemed to work-until we tried this method: Put chicken wire or some sort of steel screen (make sure the holes are not too small) over the favored location; cover the screen with dirt, and wait. Your dogs will try to dig as before, but the wire covering will stop them from getting too far, and the dogs will be deterred because the wire hurts their paws. Before long, they will give up, and you’ve solved your digging problem!</p><p>Scott Hollis<br />Lawrence, Kansas</p><p></p><hr /><strong>The Taste of Fall</strong><p>Ahhh, autumn! The crunch of crisp leaves underfoot; a sip of spiced cider; the heady aroma of fall leaves burning, pumpkin pies baking, cinnamon, allspice and nutmeg.</p><p>Here are a couple of recipes to bring the scent of autumn into your home:</p><p>Baked Apple Cuplets<br />Coating/filling:<br />1/4 cup sugar<br />1/2 teaspoon cinnamon<br />6 apples<br />Batter:<br />2/3 cup sugar<br />2/3 cup flour<br />1/4 teaspoon baking powder<br />Pinch of salt<br />1 egg<br />3 tablespoons butter, melted<br />1 teaspoon vanilla</p><p>Combine the one-quarter cup sugar with the one-half teaspoon cinnamon. Peel and core the apples, and then roll in the mixture. Place in custard cups coated with nonstick spray. Fill the apple cavities with any remaining sugar/cinnamon mixture and set aside. To make the batter, stir together the sugar, flour, baking powder and salt. Lightly beat the egg, mix with the melted butter and vanilla, and then add to the dry ingredients. Stir well. The batter will be thick. Put 2 tablespoons of the batter over each apple. Set the custard cups in a baking dish and bake in a 375-degree oven for 40 to 45 minutes, until the apples are tender. Serves 6.</p><p>Cider Mulls<br />You can use these cider mulls for a festive and aromatic drink. When packaged in a pretty bag, they make a delightful gift.</p><p>1 medium orange<br />1/2 cup brown sugar<br />2 teaspoons ground allspice<br />1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br />2 sticks cinnamon<br />Whole cloves<br />Apple cider or juice</p><div class="sidebar"><hr /><h3>Cedar Split-rail Fence</h3><p>When my wife and I purchased our country house in 1985, the cedar trees were overgrown on the north side of the house. Over the next several years, some blew down and the local utility company removed others that were under power lines. I began to save the logs with the hope that I eventually would make a split-rail fence.</p><p>In the fall of 1999, I purchased a sledgehammer and metal wedge and went to work. I cut the posts and rails to length with an electric chain saw, and split the rails with the hammer and wedge, notching the posts with my electric drill. After some frustration and ingenuity, I succeeded in making and installing my own 88-foot fence that consists of 11 sections of 8-foot rails and 12 posts.</p><p>The fence is still standing and in good shape today.</p><p>Daniel Boerman</p></div><p>Cut the orange in half and scoop out the pulp. Place a crumpled ball of aluminum foil in each orange half to maintain their shape. Place them on a baking sheet and dry in a 200-degree oven for 4 to 5 hours, leaving the door slightly open. Remove the foil and allow the orange halves to dry in the oven for 15 minutes more.</p><p>In a small bowl, combine the brown sugar, allspice and nutmeg. Mix well. Pack half of the mixture into each orange section. Decorate the tops with a whole cinnamon stick and cloves, pushing them down into the brown sugar mixture. To serve: put one mull into 3 cups of cider and simmer over low heat for 20 minutes. Serve hot. To give as a gift, wrap each half in plastic wrap and attach directions.</p><p>Makes two mulls, or enough for about 6 (1-cup) servings.</p><p>Jan Woolley<br />Hermann, Missouri</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Raising Bread Dough</strong><p>Looking for a warm place to raise your yeast-bread dough in winter Simply plug in an electric heating pad on the low setting and place it on the kitchen counter. Put the covered bowl of dough on the pad. As the bowl gradually warms, the dough rises nicely. Glass, pottery or metal bowls all will work.</p><p>Barbara Coleman<br />Henderson, Nebraska</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Scare Away Birds</strong><p>In Waimanalo, Hawaii, birds were eating my seeds as quickly as I could plant them. But each time the sprinkler turned on, the birds were frightened away for a while. I began to think about using a “snap action” intermittent sprinkler that could keep the birds away all the time. I wanted something that wouldn’t need an electric outlet or batteries. I was disappointed to learn that no such product existed, so I jumped on the idea of making one myself with permanent magnets. The sprinkler pops open from the water pressure, and then closes again after the water is released. It runs automatically as long as the water is turned on. It works as an irrigation system in addition to just scaring animals away. See the sprinkler in action at www.spritzwiz.com/index.htm.</p><p>Quentin McKenna<br />Boulder, Colorado</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Gophers and Gum</strong><p>To get rid of pesky gophers, roll together two pieces (one won’t work) of Wrigley’s Juicy Fruit gum and put them down the gopher hole. We have tried several other methods without success, but this works like a charm for us!</p><p>Joel and Donna De Blauw<br />Valley Springs, California</p><p></p><hr /><strong>Safe Scrub</strong><p>I can’t believe I thought baking soda only was for baking all those years. I could have been using it to clean, scrub and deodorize.</p><p>I make my own disinfectant by combining four parts baking soda with one part borax. I store the mixture in a shaker container and then use it as a soft-scrubbing cleaner. It safely scrubs away soils and grease without scratching or putting harmful chemicals into our environment.</p><p>Used in the kitchen, it cleans sinks, countertops, microwaves, pots and pans, cutting boards and food containers. Stick a small box of this miracle deodorizer in the refrigerator to eliminate odors. When casserole dishes get burned food stuck on them, just fill the dish with hot water and add 1-tablespoon baking soda and let it soak. Keep garbage disposals fresh by putting in several inches of warm water and a handful of baking soda. Turn on the disposal and let the water run out.</p><p>Baking soda works great in bathrooms. It safely removes tough dirt and soap scum on sinks, tubs, showers and toilets, and is a super grout cleaner.</p><p>I buy giant-size boxes of it and keep them near at hand for my household cleaning.</p><p>Marti French<br />Jefferson, Colorado</p><div class="sidebar"><hr /><h3>Share Your Wisdom!</h3><p>Have you learned some trick of the trade, secret formula or way to work more sustainably around the homesteadWe’ll pay you $25 to $50 for each letter we publish.
