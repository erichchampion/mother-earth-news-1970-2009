                    <h5 id="byline">      By Bob Langevin    </h5>        <h3>      Eat better by toasting and mixing a tasty, nutritious      breakfast.    </h3>    <p>      <strong>W</strong>e have heard a lot lately about the      importance of whole grains in our diet-even the U.S.      Department of Agriculture has come to this conclusion. Of      course, many of us already knew this.    </p>    <p>      My wife, Mitzie, and I raised our four children on a small,      self-sufficient homestead in Massachusetts. We discovered      that breakfast was the best time to get whole grains into      our diet. We love old-fashioned rolled oats, but not every      day; so we have come up with a concept that organizes and      simplifies preparing breakfast, and gives us a large      variety from which to choose.    </p>    <p>      We have a dozen or more kinds of whole grains in tightly      sealed wide-mouth jars arranged on our kitchen shelves,      placed out of the sun to keep the grains fresher. From      these jars we concoct new combinations to our hearts’      content.    </p>    <p>      We always purchase quality whole grains, avoiding processed      products that have lost their goodness. We think certified      organic is the way to go. Cracked and toasted wheat, rye      and barley berries are flavor enhancers when mixed with      other grains. Corn is another favorite of ours, both whole      and ground into meal. The two corns mixed together create a      thick, creamy cereal.    </p>    <p>      Other jars on our shelves contain dried fruits such as      raisins, apples, pears and strawberries. Dried Jerusalem      artichokes are a great sweetener; we shred and dry them for      this purpose. Sunflower seeds or nuts can be added to any      cereal. We also sprinkle brewer’s yeast onto the      cereal at serving time.    </p>    <p>      Toasted grains are a bit time consuming to prepare, but our      method is fairly simple and worth the time. First, the      whole grains are run through a grain mill to crack the      outer shell. We use our 30-year-old Corona hand-crank mill,      setting the adjustment as coarse as possible. Two quarts is      a good amount to mill at one time-so it can be used      before losing its freshness. Toast the cracked grain in a      hot and dry cast-iron skillet, stirring constantly to keep      the grain from burning. You want it to be slightly      toasted-the grain will start popping and give off a      nutty aroma. Remove the skillet to a rack to cool, and stir      a bit longer to make sure the grain does not burn, because      cast iron stays hot for a long time. After the grain cools      completely, store it in a jar with a tight lid and a label.    </p>    <p>      Parched corn also is easy to make. Harvest mature, fresh      corn right from the garden and blanch it in boiling water.      While still hot, cut the kernels off the cob, spread them      on a cookie sheet and place in a 110- to 120-degree oven      for 12 to 16 hours; stir the kernels and rotate the pans      occasionally. The parched corn, when cooled and stored in      tight jars, will keep a long time; and when reconstituted      into cornmeal porridge, it tastes out of this world.    </p>    <p>      Most of our cereals are cooked in a ratio of 2-to-1; so a      batch for two people would be 1 cup of water to one-half      cup of grain mixture. Here are four of our favorite      combinations:    </p>        <p>      • 1/4 cup cracked barley and 1/4 cup toasted cracked      whole wheat    </p>    <p>      • 1/4 cup rice, 1/4 cup toasted cracked whole wheat      and 1 teaspoon shredded/dried Jerusalem artichokes    </p>    <p>      • 1/4 cup millet, 1/4 cup toasted cracked rye and 1      tablespoon buckwheat    </p>    <p>      • 1/4 cup quinoa, 1/4 cup toasted cracked rye and 1      teaspoon brewer’s yeast    </p>    <p>      Corn porridge is our favorite; the measurements are a      little different:    </p>    <p>      1 cup water<br />      1/3 cup corn meal<br />      2 tablespoons parched corn<br />      1 teaspoon pastry flour?    </p>    <p>      Don’t forget good old-fashioned rolled oats with lots      of raisins, or maybe applesauce stirred in at serving      time.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Sources for Whole Grains      </h3>      <p>        Arrowhead Mills<br />        (800) 434-4246<br />        www.arrowheadmills.com      </p>      <p>        Bob’s Red Mill<br />        (800) 553-2258<br />        www.bobsredmill.com      </p>      <p>        Eden Foods<br />        (888) 441-3336<br />        www.edenfoods.com      </p>      <p>        Great River Organic Milling<br />        (608) 687-9580<br />        www.greatrivermilling.com      </p>      <p>        King Arthur Flour<br />        (800) 827-6836<br />        www.kingarthurflour.com      </p>      <p>        Montana Milling<br />        (800) 548-8554<br />        www.montanamilling.com      </p>      <p>        Pleasant Hill Grain<br />        (800) 321-1073<br />        www.pleasanthillgrain.com      </p>      <p>        Sun Organic Farm<br />        (888) 269-9888<br />        www.sunorganicfarm.com      </p>      <p>        Wood Prairie Farm<br />        (207) 425-7741<br />        www.woodprairie.com      </p>    </div>    <hr />    <p>      Bob Langevin and his wife, Mitzie, live in Chesterville,      Maine.
