                    <h3>      Anyone can bring down a tree safely by preparing carefully      and cutting correctly.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Malcolm Margolin    </h5>        <p>      <strong>C</strong>utting down trees can be dangerous work,      especially in yards with buildings and power lines nearby.      Even if you are cutting firewood out in the forest, you      should prepare carefully before you begin sawing. Trees      don’t always fall exactly where you intend, and if      they bounce off neighboring branches, you could be injured      if you are standing too close. Wherever you are cutting      down a tree, having someone along to help or just watch is      a smart thing to do.    </p>    <p>      To do the job well, you’ll need to establish a      comfortable work area. First, clear out a place around the      tree where you can get a firm footing and have enough space      to work with a chain saw. Lop off any lower branches in      your way. Before making any cuts, walk around the tree and      study it. Are you sure this is a tree you want to      eliminate-is it a nut or fruit tree; does it have nests in      it; is it a rare species.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Judging the Fall</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you have decided which tree to cut, think about where      the tree will naturally fall. Which way is it leaning?      Stand back and hold an axe in front of you by the tip of      the handle. The handle will be plumb (straight up and down)      because of the bottom weight, and by sighting along the      handle, you can determine the lean of the tree. This is the      most important indication of which direction the tree will      go.    </p>    <p>      Next, look at the balance: If there are too many heavy      branches on one side, it may pull the tree over to that      side. Pay close attention to the top of the tree; if it is      nodding in one direction when the wind blows, this will      influence the way the tree will fall.    </p>    <p>      Check the trunk at about waist height-where you will be      cutting-for rot. Look for holes in the trunk of the tree.      Several large, dead branches on the tree may signify      interior decay. Any rot can influence the direction the      tree will fall. If you have reason to believe there is      considerable rot in the trunk of the tree, get the advice      of an experienced tree cutter before proceeding.    </p>    <p>      These four factors-lean, balance, wind and rot-will give      you a good idea of where the tree will land. With that in      mind, look for a clear space, or bed, into which to drop      the tree, where it won’t damage anything valuable or      get hung up in the branches of another tree. Never try to      drop a tree up a steep slope-it could kick back at you when      it hits the ground.    </p>    <p>      You now know where you want to drop the tree and where the      tree wants to fall. But do you both agree? If you and the      tree are within 45 degrees of each other, you can proceed      without any special cuts. If you are unsure of where the      tree will fall, you can direct it by tying a rope or cable      as high on the tree as you can reach. Either make certain      the rope is long enough that whoever is pulling does not      end up under the tree, or put the rope around a tree out in      front of the spot you want your tree to fall, so that your      helper can pull from the side at a 90-degree angle. Also,      create two escape routes so you can move away quickly as      soon as the tree begins to fall. Fix the routes firmly in      your mind.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Dropping a Tree</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you first try felling a tree, be prepared for the      possibility that you will drop a tree in the wrong      direction. Learn from your mistakes and eventually      you’ll master the craft.    </p>    <p>      For small trees up to about 6 inches in diameter, you do      not need any fancy cuts. When you have cut about      three-quarters of the way through the tree, you can usually      stand to one side and push the tree over into its bed.      Pushing with a forked stick is particularly effective.    </p>    <p>      The traditional way of felling bigger trees is with an      undercut and a back cut. It is possible to use an axe, but      also dangerous. Chopping tends to dislodge weak branches,      which can fall on your head, and the lack of precision with      an axe cut makes it harder to predict where the tree will      fall. Using a saw-such as a chain saw or tubular-frame bow      saw-will make it easier to predict where the tree will      fall, but you must exercise caution with these tools, too.    </p>    <p>      The undercut is the first cut you will make. It should be      made on the side where you want the tree to fall. Begin at      waist height with a horizontal cut, continuing to about      one-third the distance through the tree. Pull out the saw      and begin another cut, angling it downward, far enough      above the first to cut out a 45-degree wedge of wood.    </p>    <p>      Make sure the horizontal cut is perpendicular to the      direction of the fall. You can check this with a handmade      sighting stick or with a straight-handled double-bit axe.      Facing the cut, insert the axe head into the wedge, resting      it on the flat, first cut. The handle then should point in      the direction you want the tree to fall.    </p>    <p>      Once you are certain that the undercut is correct, you can      begin the final cut, also known as the back or felling cut.      Go around to the other side of the tree, opposite the      undercut side, and saw into the tree about 2 inches above      the base of the undercut. Keep the cut horizontal;      don’t angle it down. Keep sawing, while paying      careful attention to the hinge-the piece of uncut wood      between the back cut and the undercut. The tree will topple      before the saw cuts all the way through, and how it falls      will depend largely on the hinge. As you saw, try to keep      the hinge uniformly thick. If it is uneven, the tree may      tear from the thin end of the hinge while hanging back on      the thick end, causing the tree to twist and fall in a      different direction than you planned.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the hinge, keep a close watch on the      kerf-the space that the saw leaves behind as you cut      through the trunk. This space will give you your only      advance warning of how the tree is going to fall. When you      get about one-third of the way toward the undercut, you      should notice the kerf getting slightly bigger. Good! This      means the tree is beginning to lean toward the undercut,      which is where you want it to go. Keep sawing-but never cut      all the way through the hinge-until you hear the crack as      the tree leans enough to break the hinge. Remove the saw      and back off quickly.    </p>    <p>      If you notice that the kerf is closing up instead of      getting bigger, you have misjudged the lean or the balance      of the tree and the tree will fall nowhere near the      direction of the undercut. Don’t just keep sawing in      the hope that the tree will change its mind; trees      don’t change their minds. If you keep sawing, the      kerf will eventually close up, trapping your saw. Before      this happens, remove the saw and have your helper put      tension on the rope attached to the tree to pull it over in      the right direction. Or put some wedges into the final cut      to open the space; saw a bit more and then knock in the      wedges a bit further until, as the tree is weakened, its      top is shifted in the right direction. If you opt for this      method and you are using a chain saw, be sure to use wooden      or plastic wedges and not metal ones that could damage the      chain’s teeth.    </p>    <p>      It is possible that the hinge will get thinner and thinner,      but the tree will give no indication of which way it is      heading because it is balanced on the hinge. It may fall      one way or the other; or with no hinge to guide it, the      tree may slide off the stump and kick out at you. When you      notice this happening, stop sawing and use ropes, a pushing      stick or wedges to get the tree down.    </p>    <p>      If the tree does not fall completely, but instead gets      caught in the branches of another tree, there is only one      safe way to dislodge it-wrap a cable around the butt end      and use a winch, come-along or truck to pull it free. Or      just leave it in place, and do not try to cut it down.      Eventually the weight of the tree or wind may dislodge it;      until then, avoid walking under the tree.    </p>    <p>      Always take your time and think through each step. You can      minimize injury by paying careful attention and stopping if      you are tired or confused. With practice and patience, you      can learn to fell a tree safely.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      Adapted from The Earth Manual: How to Work on Wild Land      Without Taming It by Malcolm Margolin, 1975.
