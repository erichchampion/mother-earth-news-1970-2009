        <p>Fire can strike without warning, but there are many simple things you can do to protect yourself and your family. October is National Fire Safety Month, and as good a time as any to be proactive and minimize your risk. Here are the main things to keep in mind as blustery fall weather sets in:</p><ol><li><strong>Create a “fire-free” zone</strong>. Clear leaves, pine needles, brush, dead grass and twigs from around your house for at least 30 feet in all directions. In pine forests, the U.S. Fire Administration recommends a minimum safety zone of 100 feet.</li><li><strong>Can those ashes.</strong> They may look like they are completely out, but ashes often contain tiny embers that can start big fires. Always dump them in a metal trash can, away from buildings.</li><li><strong>Check your chimney.</strong> Clean it regularly - check for obstructions, excess creosote, loose mortar and cracks in the flue. Don’t neglect the firebox, stove gaskets or pipe connections. <em>(For more about wood heat safety, we highly recommend</em> <a title="www.woodheat.org" href="http://www.woodheat.org/" target="_blank">www.woodheat.org</a><em>, a site managed by</em> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span><em> contributer John Gulland. -Mother)</em> </li><li><strong>Don’t hide.</strong> Make sure your house number is clearly visible from the road. Firefighters can’t help you if they can’t find you.</li><li><strong>Watch the wind.</strong> It can quickly turn a small trash fire into a raging inferno.</li><li><strong>Be alarmed.</strong> Have multiple smoke alarms in your home and test them monthly. Install new batteries every spring and fall.</li><li><strong>Cook carefully.</strong> Cooking causes more fires than home heating. Keep a pan lid nearby in case a grease fire starts in a frying pan, and never turn your back on a deep fryer.</li><li><strong>Call the fire department.</strong> Dial 911 at the first sign of trouble and get everyone out of the house. Don’t wait or try to extinguish the flames yourself. </li></ol><hr />
