    <meta name="description" content="Aug. 14, 2009 | We are in a race between tipping points in nature and our political systems.

        The United States increased the share of its grain harvest going to fuel ethanol — from 15 percent of the 2005 crop to more than 25 percent of the 2008 crop — in an effort to reduce its oil insecurity. However, this increase helped drive world grain prices to all-time highs by mid-2008, creating unprecedented world food insecurity.
