        <p>One of the easiest ways to keep your cool in the summer is to use fans. In addition to moving air around, which makes us feel cooler, fans can, if properly located, purge heat from a house and draw in cool outside air. Moreover, fans use less energy than central air conditioners and evaporative coolers, and are less expensive to install. Fans can dramatically lower utility bills by reducing the need to use air conditioning.</p><p>Follow these links for information on specific fan types:<br /><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/Ceiling-Fan.aspx" target="_blank">Ceiling Fans: A Simple Cooling Method</a><br /><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/Solar-Attic-Fans.aspx" target="_blank">Solar Attic Fans: Cool Your Attic and Your Home</a><br /><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Homes/Whole-House-Fan.aspx" target="_blank">Whole-house Fans: Easy, Low-cost Cooling</a> </p><h3>What Will You Save?</h3><p>A regular <strong>attic fan</strong> uses electricity, but saves about 10 percent on air conditioning costs by keeping your attic (and, as a result, the living space below it) cooler. <b>Solar-powered attic fans</b> have a higher initial cost.</p><p>A <b>ceiling or portable floor fan</b> will cut your energy costs if you have central air conditioning - <em>if</em> you raise the thermostat setting. For every degree you turn it up, you will cut 7 to 10 percent from your cooling costs.</p><p>Using a <b>whole-house fan</b> - instead of air conditioning - when the temperature cools off in the evening and early morning hours can save significantly on energy costs. Not only does a whole-house fan cost less to run than air conditioning, but it can cool a house down in just a few minutes, after the outside air temperature has decreased.</p><h3>What Will it Cost?</h3><p><strong>Ceiling and Attic Fans<br /></strong>Cost Estimate: Installation of two ceiling fans and two solar attic fans, controls and wiring.</p><p>Ceiling fans range from: $45 to $700<br />Attic fans start around: $90<br />Solar attic fans cost between: $300 and $700<br />Cost for materials only: $750<br />Contractor’s total, including materials, labor and markup: $1,500</p><p><strong>Whole-house Fans<br /></strong>The materials cost (whole-house fan and other supplies) can be anywhere from about $300 to more than $1,200</p><p>Cost Estimate: Installation of a whole-house fan, including a high-quality 36-inch-square, 6,500-cubic-feet-per-minute (cfm), two-speed fan with switch, wiring and new circuit breaker, as well as an allowance for framing and drywall repair materials.</p><p>Contractor’s total, including materials, labor and markup: $1,450</p><p><em>Costs are national averages and do not include sales tax. If you have a contractor do several small projects at once, you’ll save money overall.</em></p><p></p><hr />This article is excerpted from <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/shopping/detail.aspx?itemnumber=4123" target="_blank">Green Home Improvement</a> by Dan Chiras.
