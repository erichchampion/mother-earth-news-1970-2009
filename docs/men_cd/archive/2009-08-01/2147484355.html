        <p>The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is teaming up with the Boys & Girls Clubs of America and parent-teacher organizations to train the next generation of eco-conscious citizens. Through the EPA’s <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/index.cfm?fuseaction=globalwarming.showPledgeHome" target="_blank">Change the World, Start with Energy Star</a> campaign, the groups will focus on teaching kids about global warming.</p><p>As part of the program, kids and their families will learn how to save energy by taking the Energy Star pledge, which includes switching to energy-efficient lighting, fully insulating homes, replacing energy hogs with more energy-efficient appliances and other home energy saving tips. Already, more than 2 million Americans have taken the pledge. According to Energy Star, if every American household followed suit, we would save $18 billion in annual energy costs.</p><p>Continue reading about the campaign at <a href="http://www.energystar.gov/changetheworld" target="_blank">Energy Star's Change the World webpage</a>.</p>
