                <p>      A little work and ingenuity, and you can have spring in      January with...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     By James L. Jones    </h5>            <p>      Imagine a cold, windy midwinter day in a Boston suburb.      Then picture yourself- <em>in</em> that chilly city      and <em>on</em> that very January day-basking in the      sun on your front steps and enjoying the first daffodil of      the season . . . all as a result of some $100 worth of 2 X      4's, concrete blocks, and (if you don't want to raid the      local dump) window sash.    </p>    <p>      Well, I used to have to pick my way up ice-rimmed brick      steps and-when I threw open the front door-be      ushered directly into the living room by a howling wind. In      those days, everyone knew when I arrived.    </p>    <p>      I got <em>tired</em> of such chilly receptions, however,      and the solution was obvious: I had to construct an      entranceway. Fortunately, my front door faces south,      and-since I like to grow plantsI decided to build a      glass enclosure with a planting bed . . . just to see what      would come up, as it were.    </p>    <p>      My project began with a simple design . . . and the      <em>execution</em> wasn't much more complicated than the      plan. I just built a raised bed of concrete block faced      with brick. Then I constructed a framework of redwood 2 X      4's-spaced to correspond to the size of the available      sash-and secured its uprights in the blocks and its      crosspieces to the eaves. Once the glass was put in, the      winter was shut out.    </p>    <h3>ADDED TOUCHES</h3>    <p>      That's about all there was to the basic construction job,      but I <em>did</em> add an extra wrinkle that you might want      to consider: I made the whole addition demountable.    </p>    <p>      The section of "ceiling" above the planting bed swings back      under the eaves . . . the steps remain covered . . . and      the rest of the glass sash can be removed from the      framework and stored. That way, each spring and summer, the      majority of the entranceway is open to the pleasant      weather.    </p>    <p>      A few winters back, in order to determine just how well the      thermal mass provided by the raised planting bed in my      sun-powered portico held the heat, I took temperature      readings- <em>before sunrise-</em> through the      month of January. I was pleased to discover that, though I      hadn't yet sealed the joints to make the area draftproof,      there was a consistent 10 to 20Â° temperature difference      between the inside of the vestibule and the bonechilling      out-of-doors.    </p>    <p>      (Of course, since I was measuring the addition's      <em>storage</em> potential, the readings were taken before      the morning sun hit the glass. The temperature difference      on a bright mid-afternoon-when the portico is really      gathering in the solar heat-can be much more      extreme.)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, in addition to the obvious, measurable results      of glassing in my entranceway, I've found that the ground      within the enclosed planting bed never freezes . . . the      steps stay dry . . . only gentle breezes (often laden with      the scent of spring flowers) waft into my protected living      room when the door is opened . . . and my home's fuel      consumption has, of course, dropped. Moreover, the      greenhouse foyer is an ideal spot for the children to      comfortably strip off their soggy winter outerwear.    </p>    <p>      Best of all, there's an <em>extra</em> benefit which warms      my gardener's heart. Yes, I <em>do</em> have daffodils in      January (miniature <em>Narcissus asturiensis</em> ) and      they're just as breathtaking as their bigger, later      relatives. And shortly thereafter come the cheerful white      stars of <em>Ipheion uniflorum-</em> along with      crocuses to supply splashes of color-followed by the      spicy scent of wallflowers. I've also found that      carnations, camellias, jasmine, aucuba, and hardy cyclamens      can survive in the solar doorway. Even my delicate      eucalyptus-which is now three winters oldis still      going strong!    </p>    <p>      Around the first of March, the bitter cold of winter ends,      and the gentle sun and cool nights are perfect for starting      many types of seedlings. At that time of year the      entranceway serves as a cold frame, and it has proved to be      an excellent place to give all kinds of vegetables and      flowers an early start.    </p>    <h3>WORTH THE EFFORT</h3>    <p>      I have lived with this unconventional home addition for      <em>nine years</em> now . . . which is certainly enough      time to evaluate and improve upon it. (This past fall, with      fuel prices up again, I found it costefficient to install      <em>double-paned</em> glass.) One of the structure's      <em>finest features-</em> to my mind-is the      surprisingly minor maintenance it requires: 15 minutes in      the spring to take the glass out and 15 more in the chilly      fall to put it back up. And that's all there is to it      (except for the self-imposed and pleasant burden of      selecting the next plant to experiment with).    </p>    <p>      Our northern winter has its place . . . and it's been my      great pleasure to <em>put</em> it there! Spring is a much      sweeter season . . . particularly in January.    </p>
