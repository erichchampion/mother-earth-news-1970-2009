            			<p>      Keep cabin fever at bay with a new version of an old      pastime... 3-D Tick-Tack Toe			!</p>          <h5 id="byline">      By David Dyer    </h5>        <p>      This little game-the "board" for which can be made in      one evening-is simply a much more      <em>challenging</em> version of the tick-tack-toe almost      all of us played (and quickly mastered) as children . . .      and the three-dimensional version makes the childhood      pastime fun again, even for grown-ups!    </p>    <p>      The only tools required to construct a 3-D tick-tack-toe      set are a saw (a handsaw will do) and a drill (preferably      electric) with a 17/64" or 9/32" drill bit. The materials      list is equally modest. It includes a 26" section of a 1/4"      dowel (you should be able to purchase a 36" length for      under 25 cents) . . . a scrap of 1 X 4 (preferably      hardwood, but softwood is OK) ... 28 macram√© beads      with 1/4" holes, which cost 10 to 20 cents apiece (get 14      each of two different colors) ... and finishing materials      (sandpaper, glue, and stain or varnish).    </p>    <h3>EASY CONSTRUCTION</h3>        <p>      To make the base of the game board, saw a 3-1/2" square      from the 1 X 4 stock. Next, cut nine 2-3/4" pieces of dowel      (to use as the game's upright "posts") and mark the peg      holes on the base.    </p>    <p>      The best way to position the holes-to-be is to draw a      2-1/2" square on the board, centered and 1/2 inch from all      edges (see the accompanying diagram). The corners of this      square will serve as the centers for the four corner pegs.      Now, measure and mark the halfway point (1-1/4") between      each two corners. These spots should be used as the centers      for the four remaining perimeter peg holes. Finally, simply      connect the last four points with two straight lines, and      their intersection will position the middle peg.    </p>    <p>      Before you drill holes at your marked points, you      should-as a precaution-begin each one with a      center punch or a nail. This will prevent the bit from      drifting, which would result in an off-center bore. (If you      use a handheld drill, be extremely careful to keep it      <em>perpendicular to</em> the base.) The holes should be      1/2" deep (an easy way to make sure they're all the same      depth is to wrap a thin strip of masking tape around the      drill to serve as a temporary gauge).    </p>    <p>      After you've finished drilling, the board should be sanded      and finished to your taste. (You can also smooth and stain      or seal the to-be-exposed ends of each of the nine pegs.)      Once the finishing process is completed and all the parts      are dry, glue the pegs into the holes, taking care that      they remain perpendicular to the board as the glue sets up.      Then, get out your beads . . . and you're ready to play!    </p>        <h3>RULES OF THE GAME</h3>    <p>      In this three-dimensional version, tick-tack-toes are      scored not only in the usual horizontal ways-on three      levels!-but also vertically, <em>or</em> at an angle      from bottom to top. With a well-placed bead, therefore, a      player may be able to complete more than one row in a      single move! For example, if you place one of your beads on      top of two of your own, you score a vertical tick-tack-toe,      but-if you're lucky and/or clever-that same      bead could finish a horizontal and a diagonal row as well,      totaling <em>three</em> points in one move.    </p>    <p>      The object of the game, of course, is to score more      tick-tack-toes than your opponent. After any impartial      method has determined who moves first, the players      alternately place a bead over any peg on the playing board      in an effort to build or block a three-in-a-row move. The      only restriction is that the beads may not be stacked more      than three high on a single peg. The player with the most      points-after all 27 positions are filled-wins.    </p>    <p>      A variation of the game (which is easier for youngsters to      master) is to play only until someone scores . . . rather      than continuing until 27 of the beads have been brought      into play. In this version, the first to score a      tick-tack-toe in any direction is the winner!    </p>
