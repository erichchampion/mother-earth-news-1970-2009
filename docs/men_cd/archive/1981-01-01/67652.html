                <p>      Here's how one of MOTHER's alcohol fuel seminar instructors      turned his Harley-Davidson motorcycle into a ...    </p>                    <p>      When one balances the "convenience" of owning an automobile      against today's high fuel prices and-in urban      areas-limited available parking, it's easy to see why      many people have chosen motorcycles as personal      transportation. Of course, the two-wheelers do have their      disadvantages (especially in poor weather), but as far as      MOTHER's alcohol researcher and seminar instructor Ned      Doyle is concerned, a "scooter" is <em>the</em> answer to      the gasoline crunch.    </p>    <p>      Quite naturally, then, between a desire to broaden his      range of alcohol fuel experience <em>and</em> the chance to      hit MOM up for free ethanol during the course of a yearlong      testing period, Doyle went ahead and converted his 1979      Harley-Davidson Sportster to the renewable fuel, and the      results were, in a word, amazing. The aircooled,      61-cubic-inch engine-normally well endowed with both      power <em>and</em> vibration as a result of its      long-stroke, twin-cylinder design-immediately became      more "civilized" . . . while apparently delivering greater      amounts of torque (Doyle attributes this to the density of      the alcohol fuel charge and its slow-burning nature, which      evenly distributes pressure on the piston head). The only      noticeable "trade-off" was a slight reduction in top speed      and a 7.8% decrease in mileage . . . both of which the      seminar instructor was content to swap for a smoother, more      comfortable ride.    </p>    <p>      Two other areas that showed marked improvement as a result      of burning the homegrown fuel were engine temperature and      oil consumption. Because ethanol has a high latent heat of      vaporization (as compared with that of gasoline), it      absorbs a good deal <em>more</em> warmth from the engine's      manifold and cylinder heads-in the process of      changing from a liquid to a vapor state-than does its      more conventional fuel counterpart. The result is a reduced      engine operating temperature . . . a welcome bonus      which-especially in an air-cooled      powerplant-can result in longer periods between oil      changes.    </p>    <p>      Ned reported that the conversion process was a relatively      simple matter. "The first thing I did was to enlarge the      main jet to 35% over its original diameter, using a small      jeweler's bit and a pin vise . . . then I reamed the fuel      port in the idle circuit to about 45% larger than normal.      Both of these changes seemed to suit the bike's Keihin      carburetor while burning 185-proof fuel. I also      found-through experimentation-that the      motorcycle's response was markedly improved when I      <em>decreased the</em> length of the accelerator pump      stroke . . . thus slightly reducing the amount of      additional fuel injected into the carb throat when the      throttle's cracked open, and thereby <em>diminishing      the</em> liquid's tendency to form globules rather than      vaporize.    </p>    <p>      "Further testing indicated that advancing the ignition      timing-a modification that's normally a matter of      course for <em>any</em> alcohol-powered engine, because of      the fuel's high 'octane' rating-had such a minor      effect on the vehicle's performance that I readjusted the      setting to factory specifications."    </p>    <p>      The remainder of Mr. Doyle's research work involved rigging      up a miniature coldstart system and testing the      effectiveness of a small fuel preheater. As a winter      starting aid (necessary when the temperatures drop below      45Â°F or so, because of the ethanol's resistance to      vaporization in cold weather), Ned simply mounted a      plunger-type plant waterer inside a homebuilt canister      fastened to the frame of his motorcycle. From the outlet      nozzle of this thumb-operated squirter he ran a short      section of 1/8" model airplane fuel line to a needle valve,      then routed a length of thin copper tubing from this      control to a small hole drilled in the wall of the      carburetor air inlet ... taking precautions that neither      the opening-nor the tube inside it-interfered      with the movement of the choke plate.    </p>    <p>      Now, when the compact container is filled with gasoline, a      pump or two on the plunger will provide a starting "prime"      for the engine . . . and the amount of boost can be      regulated with the needle valve.    </p>    <p>      The fuel preheater was another matter. Borrowing ideas from      MOTHER's experiments with her Chevy pickup truck (see      MOTHER NO. 61, page 86), the researcher located a short      piece of copper tubing having an outside diameter      compatible with the <em>inside dimensions</em> of the      motorcycle's fuel line. He then found a copper strap (about      1/2" wide and 3" long), formed one end of it completely      around the center of the tube section, and soldered the two      "penny metal" components together. Cutting the alcohol fuel      line in half, resplicing it to the two ends of the      preheater, and bolting the metal medium to a convenient      "hot spot" on the engine allowed sufficient thermal energy      to be transferred through the device to warm the fuel.    </p>    <p>      During more <em>moderate</em> seasons, Doyle found that the      preheater had little effect on performance or mileage . . .      but in <em>cold</em> weather, its presence tended to      enhance the engine's operation.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, some people may be wondering what long-term      effects the alcohol has had on the bike's fuel system.      According to Ned, there was no noticeable deterioration. "I      did encounter a slight swelling of the O-ring seals when I      tried to reassemble the carburetor after a periodic check,      but they returned to original size when they dried out. So,      other than a minimal amount of white, powdery residue in      the carb float bowl and fuel tank, there seems to be little      problem with using ethanol . . . even though some of the      carburetor's components are synthetic."    </p>    <p>      The bottom line, then-at least as far as Ned Doyle's      12-month experience goes-is that his twowheeled      transportation adapted readily to "homegrown energy" . . .      so well, in fact, that it may never see another drop of      gasoline!    </p>
