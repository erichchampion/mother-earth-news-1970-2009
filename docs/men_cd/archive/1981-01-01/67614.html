                <p>      Using her means of providing for an entire Alaskan husky      sled team as an example, a reader explains how <em>you</em>      can . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Miki Collins    </h5>                                <p>      I don't think a homestead is really complete without a few      animals roaming the place, but-as you probably      know-the cost of maintaining pets or working critters      can be prohibitive <em>. . . especially</em> for folks who      live in rural areas where obtaining store-bought supplies      requires expensive travel.    </p>    <p>      However, you <em>can</em> feed a canine crew economically      and nutritiously . . . just as my sister Julie and I do,      here on our isolated spread in the bush country of central      Alaska. We were inspired to make our own dog food by the      sheer expense of buying premixed dry feed. Including      freight charges, a 50-pound bag of commercial dog food      costs us a whopping $22, so we decided that we'd have to      find some less expensive way of feeding our sled team of      eight animals.    </p>    <p>      The basic ingredient of the low-cost dog dinners is fish.      We catch plenty in the lake near our cabin . . . and you      can feed <em>your</em> kennel of hounds from a similar      source (or even, perhaps, buy large quantities of      inexpensive "trash" fish from local commercial fisherfolk      ).    </p>    <p>      During the summer, we use gill nets (such seines are      illegal in many areas, so be sure to check local game laws      before netting fish) to bring up an abundant harvest of      whitefish, pike, burbot, and suckers each day. When winter      arrives, of course, we first have to chop holes in the      three-foot layer of ice that covers the lake-a      tedious, tiring job-but the nets can then be left in      the water for up to a week without any spoilage of the      catch. If our haul is larger than the dogs' daily ration,      we dry and store the extras for use during the spring and      fall (when erratic ice movement makes netting unsafe).    </p>    <h3>A FINE KETTLE OF FISH</h3>    <p>      We usually cook the swimmers whole-heads, guts,      scales, and all-to provide our dogs with hearty,      wholesome meals. (We've noticed that the beasts <em>do</em>      sometimes choke while eating, but never because they have      bones caught in their throats . . . it's simply a result of      their gulping the food too fast. If fish is cooked      <em>long</em> enough, the skeletons become soft and easy to      chew . . . posing little danger to canine gullets.)    </p>    <p>      A cereal supplement of rice or oatmeal can be used to fill      out a skimpy netful . . . and will also add extra nutrients      on those days when the animals have to work long hours and      haul particularly heavy loads, or when the temperature is      extremely cold. (Under such conditions, the huskies may      need extra calories just to maintain their body weights . .      . so it's sometimes necessary to mix a half-cup of lard,      per animal, into the meal.)    </p>    <p>      We also add game birds and other small trapped or hunted      animals to the kettle (as well as inexpensive meat      trimmings that are sometimes available from the grocery      store). Here in Alaska's interior, for example, the hare      population fluctuates regularly . . . but we find we can      usually snare several of the large rabbits a day during the      peak season, and then stew up one hare (plus a little lard      and oatmeal) for each dog.    </p>    <p>      Table scraps provide an additional wide range of possible      ingredients for our homestead canines' dinner menu. We      throw in such leftovers as old potatoes, stale bread, cold      zucchini, moldy cheese, and carrot tops. The dogs even seem      to enjoy the chickweed and lamb's-quarters that I      occasionally add to the pot when the fish ration is getting      scarce. (Remember, however, that dogs are <em>not</em>      natural vegetarians . . . so plant matter-much of      which the animals can't digest-should make up only a      <em>small</em> part of their total diet.)    </p>    <p>      We cook our "canine fuel" in the sawedoff bottom half of a      55-gallon drum . . . which is hung from a wooden tripod      over an open fire in the summer and set on top of our      woodstove during the colder months. Once the food is in the      pot, we pour in two or three gallons of water. (Whenever      oatmeal or rice is included in the mix, however, it's a      good idea to add <em>more</em> water than usual . . . and      stir the stew often, since grains tend to stick to the      kettle and-as a resultwill burn quite easily.)    </p>    <p>      When we're cooking outside, I build a large fire using      driftwood found on the lake shore. As the flames grow under      the pot, the homecooked hash comes to a boil, simmers for      about half an hour . . . and then cools slowly while the      fire burns down. (It's important, of course, to cook fish      and game <em>completely,</em> in order to kill any      parasites the critters might be car rying.) The food will      be ready when the bones are soft, the meat crumbles easily      into small chunks, and the whole mixture has a thick, mushy      consistency.    </p>    <h3>DINNER IS SERVED</h3>    <p>      We feed our hardworking helpers once a day . . . and their      dinner hour always results in quite a scene! Julie gathers      the animals' pans, and I dish out the portions according to      each eager eater's weight. After an active day on the      trail, the dogs are <em>always</em> hungry . . . and their      individual reactions to the sight and smell of a steaming      pan of fish are highly predictable . . . and entertaining.      Yukon-our big 100-pound malamute-joyfully hurls      his bulk into the air when he sees dinner approaching. The      smaller wolf/husky, Loki-who's always alert and high      strung-whines and dances impatiently at the end of      his chain, waiting with increasing anxiety until his pan is      set down in front of him. Trapper, another greedy malamute,      stands and stares intently at the pot . . . his eyes      growing wider and wider until he's allowed to attack his      share.    </p>    <p>      The general chorus of yelps and barks that always greets      the arrival of loaded food dishes subsides into a steady      slurping as the dogs consume their meal . . . and, finally,      the yard is silent except for the contented lapping of      tongues.    </p>    <p>      I'd bet that almost <em>any</em> dog-whether it's a      husky, malamute, or just plain old garden-variety      mutt-would thrive on a diet of fish, meat, and      vegetable stew. The nutritious, wellbalanced combination is      a great way to feed your tail-waggers economically . . .      and the extra effort will be well rewarded as you see your      crew dig eagerly into the tasty mush. As long as you can      net or (inexpensively) buy fish in bulk quantities, you're      in business . . . and so are the four-legged friends that      pull your sled, herd your sheep, or just patrol your      homestead acres!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: You can learn more about the art of training      and using an Alaskan dog team by reading "Homestead Dog      Sledding" (MOTHER NO. 60, page 88).
