                <p>      It doesn't take much cash or time to recycle an old      refrigerator into . . .    </p>            <p>      Most cost-conscious folks would frown on the purchase of a      product that might see use only once or twice in a year's      time. But when that same implement can be salvaged-at      almost <em>no</em> expense-chances are that the      frowns will turn to smiles . . . no matter how      <em>often</em> the device is used!    </p>    <p>      Such is the case with MOTHER's combination air and vacuum      pump, which is nothing more than a slightly modified      refrigerator compressor, but is still capable of inflating      tires, filling air tanks, recharging cooling systems, or      evacuating heat pipes . . . all with just a little      tinkering. MOM's research crew discovered several years ago      that many folks were literally <em>begging</em> to be rid      of old iceboxes-most of which had bad door seals or      temperamental thermostats, but perfectly <em>good</em>      compressors-so locating the "raw material" for this      project should be no problem, even if it requires a trip to      your local dump.    </p>    <h3>BUILD IT IN AN HOUR</h3>    <p>      The conversion from cooler to pump is an easy one. The job      requires a tubing cutter or hacksaw, a drill with an      assortment of bits, a soldering iron and some 50/50      general-purpose plumbing solder, a handsaw, a 9/16" wrench,      and a pair of pliers. In the way of hardware, you'll need      six No. 8 X 1" flathead wood screws, a No. 6 X 2" threaded      wood fastener, a 1/4" pipe tee, a 1/4" pipe to 1/4" tube      flare coupling, a 1/4" pipe to 1/4" hose barb, a 1/4" male      45° permanent flare coupling (available from your local      refrigeration and heating supply jobber), a 1/4" X 2" bolt      with nut and washer, and a 1/4" stem 0-100 PSI pressure      gauge. A scrap of 2 X 4 about 32" long will also be      required, and a length of bicycle tire pump hose.    </p>    <p>      The first step, of course, is to investigate a fridge or      two until you discover a self-contained hermetic compressor      similar to that shown in the photograph. (Be warned that      not <em>all</em> canister-style pressurizers are the same.      Some have a permanent oil reservoir, while others use the      circulating refrigerant as a lubri cant and hence will      <em>not</em> run indefinitely when salvaged. Ask your local      refrigeration mechanic . . . he or she may be able to tell      you which type your choice is.) Remove the mechanism by      unbolting its mounting platform from the refrigerator frame      and cutting the coolant "feed" lines as far from the drive      unit as possible. (Important: <em>Always</em> wear goggles      and gloves-and work in a well-ventilated      area-whenever you are discharging a refrigerant.)    </p>    <p>      Next, locate the <em>largest</em> -diameter pipe (this      suction "hose" is usually found protruding from the bottom      of the canister) and the <em>uppermost</em>      3/16"-outside-diameter tube (which is the      <em>discharge</em> hose) on the housing. Trim the inlet      line to about 6" in length, and the outlet line to a foot      or so . . .taking care not to collapse either conduit wall      as you cut. With this done, remove an 8" section of 1/4"      <em>O.D. flared-end</em> copper tubing from one of the      lines left in the main body of the cooler (if you can't      find one, just 45°flare the tip of a scrounged straight      piece of tube), and cut a 2" stub off the "funneled" end.    </p>    <p>      Now slip your flare nut over this short segment,      and-taking the remaining 6" piece of 1/4"      line-prepare to fasten the small section to the      pump's outlet pipe, and the <em>longer</em> portion to its      "draw" hose. (This suction pipe will "surround" its      narrower mate . . . while the pressure tube should fit      <em>within its</em> matching half.) Clean all the      to-be-joined surfaces with some steel wool and a sliver of      fine sandpaper, then solder the respective pieces together.      When the work has cooled, fasten the 1/4" flare coupling to      the exposed end of the vacuum tube. (You can also take this      opportunity to plug-with solder-any additional      hoses coming from the canister, if they're not sealed up      already.)    </p>    <p>      Assemble the remainder of your fittings by threading the      flare coupling and the hose barb to the tee-on the      "arms" opposite each other-and the pressure gauge to      the junction's third outlet. (You might want to use a      thread sealant to prevent leakage here.) Finally, solder      your 1/4" X 2" bolt to the <em>back</em> of the tee fitting      (the side to the rear of the gauge).    </p>    <p>      Complete the project by measuring the length of the      compressor's mounting platform, and cutting a section of      your 2 X 4 to equal that dimension (the remaining scrap of      wood can be trimmed to match the structure's width). Rip      the longer plank in half (on its broad side), then mount      the pair of wooden skids to the frame's base-and the      crosspiece to its upper surface-by placing the 1"      screws through existing holes and into the wood. (You can      also, at this time, drill a 1/4" hole in the transverse      support to hold the gauge and tee in place . . . but      remember to tighten the flare nut to its coupling      <em>before</em> mounting the brass components.) When that's      done, all that remains is to secure the motor's electric      relay box (a self-actuating safety switch) to the 2 X      4-as shown in the drawing-with a 2" wood screw,      and attach the air hose to its barbed nipple with a clamp.    </p>    <h3>A DUAL-PURPOSE TOOL</h3>    <p>      You'll discover-as we did-that your homebuilt      compressor/ vacuum pump is a hardworking and versatile      tool. Even though it doesn't have the <em>capacity</em> of      some larger store-bought models (a handicap that merely      causes it to take longer to do the biggest jobs), it is      capable of delivering over 100 pounds of air pressure . . .      far more than you'll ever need to fill a tire, charge a      well tank, or even spray paint (which would, of course,      require the addition of a pressure storage tank to the      pump). And-in case you aim to recharge auto air      conditioning systems or refrigerators-the inlet      fitting is compatible with standard vacuum gauges . . . and      the compressor can draw about 24" of mercury with little      problem.    </p>    <p>      Considering the fact that the <em>commercial</em> equipment      necessary to do the jobs MOM's pump can handle could cost      $400 or more, we're willing to bet that cost-conscious      handypersons will find the device well worth an hour's time      and a few dollars spent at the hardware store!    </p>
