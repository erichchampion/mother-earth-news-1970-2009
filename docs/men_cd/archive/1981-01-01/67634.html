                    <h5 id="byline">      By Marc Bristol    </h5>        <p>      Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves from      time to time, right? And almost everybody these days wants      to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a little      do-it-yourself entertainment?    </p>    <p>      And that's what this column is all about. Down-home music      that you can make . . . and the instruments (which, in some      cases, you can also make!) to play that music on.    </p>    <p>      The important thing is th at this is your column. If you      like it, write to me and let me know. If you have some      ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm open to any      suggestions or information you care to contribute. I'll      even try to answer your questions about down-home music . .      . butboth for the benefit of all MOTHER 's readers and to      ease my correspondence loadI'll deal with those questions,      whenever possible, here in this column . . . rather than in      personal letters.    </p>    <p>      Address your correspondence for this column and this column      only-to Marc Bristol, 18520 312th Ave. N.E., Duvall, Wash.      98019.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      A Dulcimer Directory    </h2>    <p>      Since this column began, I've often been asked to cover the      subject of the Appalachian dulcimer. I've waited until now      to do so, however, because I wasn't-until      recently-either a dulcimer owner <em>or</em> player.      Oh sure, I've <em>tried</em> the Instrument now and then,      when I ran across one at somebody's house, but I never      caught the bug.    </p>    <p>      In spite of that, when David Johnston and Rose LeClere (of      Black Mountain Instruments) wrote and offered to send me      one of their dulcimer-building kits-to help me become      more acquainted with the instrument-I couldn't pass      up the opportunity.    </p>    <p>      I've since discovered that there's a steadily growing group      of dulcimer musicians becoming involved in American folk      music today. And many of these "new" artists have been      experimenting with-and stretching the limits      of-the lap dulcimer's musical capabilities. After      all, plucking simple single-note melodies is a good place      to begin . . . but chances are that learning such advanced      techniques as chording up the neck and finger-picking may      prove to be even <em>more</em> rewarding.    </p>    <p>      So if you've decided to take up dulcimer playing,      <em>do</em> think of it as an easy place to get started in      string music . . . but also set your sights on the horizon      and keep truckin'. You'll find that a lot more is possible      with the uncomplicated instrument than playing "Mary Had a      Little Lamb"!    </p>    <h3>THE CLASSIC APPALACHIAN      DULCIMER</h3>    <p>      The traditional Appalachian dulcimer is also often referred      to as a lap, plucked, or fretted dulcimer. The larger      <em>hammered</em> dulcimer, on the other hand, is a      forerunner of the piano, and was probably the first to bear      the name "dulcimer". Both, however, are members of the      zither (or harp) family.    </p>    <p>      The Appalachian dulcimer is traditionally played sitting      down, with the instrument set across the lap. Notes are      fretted either with the fingers of the left hand or with a      "noter stick", while the right hand strums with a pick (or      perhaps a feather quill). The traditional instrument has      three strings . . . one that's used to play the melody, and      two drones. (More modern versions sometimes have      <em>two</em> melody strings.) Some of today's dulcimer      players add a neck strap to the instrument, and play it      standing up. And many accomplished pickers now fret whole      chords, fingering all of the strings in the process.    </p>    <p>      Most common lap dulcimers are either "hourglass" or      "teardrop" shaped. Other designs <em>are</em> possible.      though, and occasionally you'll see a "courting dulcimer",      which is actually two musicmakers in one. (The man and      woman play facing each other, with the instrument across      <em>both</em> their laps.)    </p>    <h3>THE AMAZING CARDBOARD      DULCIMER</h3>    <p>      Although dulcimers are usually constructed of wood, I      recently received one made from corrugated cardboard. And      here's the <em>kicker:</em> It has a <em>remarkably</em>      good sound!    </p>    <p>      So, with the help of the folks at Black Mountain      Instruments <em>and</em> the editor of <em>Dulcimer Players      News,</em> I located David Cross . . . the man who makes      the cardboard dulcimers.    </p>    <p>      David designed the instrument as a demonstration project      for the children in his third grade class. He wanted to      show the youngsters how folks tucked way back up in the      hills might put an instrument together out of whatever      materials they could find. The frets on his dulcimers, for      instance, are simply finishing nails, each one bent 90°      at the tip and pounded into a small drilled hole at the end      of a slot designed to hold the "fret" in place. The slot      isn't any wider than a saw blade (use a miter saw, with a      cutting edge 1/10" across, if you want to duplicate Dave's      design).    </p>    <p>      To simplify things even further, David used inexpensive      guitar tuning pegs instead of the "friction" pegs more      commonly found in the traditional mountain instruments. So      if you're scrounging to find parts, your nearest junkyard      or salvage shop may be able to provide you with an      inexpensive old guitar. . . whose tuners can be used for      <em>two</em> traditional dulcimers.    </p>    <p>      David is now producing three-string model kits that range      in price from $7.50 (you find your own cardboard and wood)      to $14.50 (all parts are supplied, and the wood and      cardboard are precut). He also produces fourstring kits for      about a dollar more, and <em>finished</em> four-string      instruments that cost $22.50 postpaid.    </p>    <p>      Dave has even written a do-it-yourself manual called      <em>Groups</em> <em>Building Dulcimers,</em> which comes      free with orders for five or more kits (or you can purchase      a copy for $2.00 plus 60 cents postage). There are bulk      ordering discounts as well . . . for those of you who have      groups of friends who might be interested in building      dulcimers together.    </p>    <p>      Finally, if you'd like a set of David's do-it-yourself      instructions (and are planning to scrounge or purchase your      own "parts"), just order his booklet, <em>Make Your Own      Dulcimer Using Common Materials</em> , for $2.50 plus      60 cents postage. (To request information or to place an      order with Mr. Cross, write Backyard Music, Dept. TMEN, 808      South 48th Street, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19143. )    </p>    <h3>THE TRADITIONAL WOODEN      DULCIMER</h3>    <p>      Folks who'd like to build a fine <em>wood</em> dulcimer      would be well advised to contact Black Mountain      Instruments, Dept. TMEN, 16264 Main Street, P.O. Box 779,      Lower Lake, California 95457. The firm's Kit No. 56K, which      the owners sent me, sells for $53. It consists of precut      parts -including mahogany sides, back, and fretboard, plus      a spruce top-and all the sound holes are predrilled. The      fret board is already assembled, and (according to the      instructions) the kit can be put together in three or four      evenings. No special tools are required, but white glue or      masking tape (used for securing clamps) will be needed.    </p>    <p>      The wood used in this kit is very beautiful, and would      certainly inspire any builder to be meticulous in finishing      his or her creation. And any extra time spent on the      "dressing up" process will certainly not be wasted, since      you'll likely be all the more satisfied with your      instrument as a result of such care.    </p>    <p>      Black Mountain products also include cherry wood and walnut      dulcimer kits . . . as well as finished instruments: The      firm's top-of-the-line spruce and walnut model sells for      $125. (Ready-to-play units, however, are sold only      <em>with</em> a case . . . which will cost an additional      $16.) If you're interested, write to the company and tell      the folks there that MOTHER sent you!    </p>    <h3>DULCIMER PLAYERS NEWS</h3>    <p>      Those of you who'd like more information about this      old-timey instrument might want to pick up a copy of      <em>Dulcimer</em> Players <em>News.</em> This quarterly      40-page publication carries everything from festival      reports to instructional articles on both hammered and lap      dulcimers . . . plus songs, interviews, and book and record      reviews. The subscription price is $6.00 a year, and back      issues are available for $1.50 each. Just send the money      with your name and address to <em>Dulcimer Players      News,</em> Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 2164, Winchester, Virginia      22601. (The magazine's editor, Maddie MacNeil, also manages      the Blue Ridge Dulcimer Shop . . . a mail order service      through which you can purchase how-to books, kits, and      finished instruments. Ask for a free catalog when writing      to DPN. )    </p>    <h3>STILL MORE SOURCES</h3>    <p>      While attending the 1980 Musical Saw Festival in Santa      Cruz, California (it was a <em>wonderful</em> festival,      definitely a "don't miss" for saw players or <em>anyone      who's</em> in the right area during September), I stopped      in at the CapriTaurus Folk Music booth and put myself on      the firm's mailing list.    </p>    <p>      Not long after doing so, I received a catalog containing a      large selection of dulcimers, kits, cases, books, and      records . . . including some items I hadn't seen in other      listings. For $3.00 you can have not only the CapriTaurus      catalog, but a regular newsletter and a subscription to      <em>Folk Music</em> Almanac. Write to CapriTaurus Folk      Music, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 153, Felton, California 95018.    </p>    <p>      During my stay in California, I also talked with several      people from Kicking Mule Records. . . who subsequently sent      me a copy of the latest album from Robert Force and Albert      d'Ossché. The record, entitled <em>Cross Over</em> ,      brings the dulcimer down out of the hills and into the      realm of many different kinds of music.    </p>    <p>      The influences of Africa, the Caribbean, Brazil, Iceland,      India, modern folk, jazz, and rock are easily heard in this      album. My favorite cut is "Paradise Boy (Hush Your Eyes)",      a calypso accompanied by steel drums, congas, and several      voices.    </p>    <p>      I also received an album by Mark Nelson called <em>Fiddle      Tunes on Dulcimer.</em> The music is all instrumental, and      features three different types of dulcimers as well as      fiddle, mandolin, and bodhran.    </p>    <p>      All of Kicking Mule's LP's are available with instructions      or tablature materials, for a small extra cost. (The      outfit's free catalog, which lists over 25 albums, is      available from Kicking Mule, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 3233,      Berkeley, California 94703.)    </p>        <h3>SPEAKING OF RECORDS . . .</h3>    <p>      Are you wondering what happened to that Homegrown Music      record I was talking about a few issues back? Well, it's      still in the works . . . and, when ready, will be      accompanied by a book featuring the arrangements to the      recorded songs.    </p>    <p>      One of the projects that got in the way of that album just      happened to be <em>another</em> recording effort (which      will have born fruit by the time you read this), featuring      the sounds of (among other musicians) the four dudes you've      seen in the photo accompanying this column in most back      issues of MOTHER. The disk is recorded by the Okie Doke      Band, and centers on western swing. Copies can be obtained,      for $4.00 postpaid, from King Noodle Records, Dept. TMEN,      8056 Southeast 72nd Street, Mercer Island, Washington      98040.    </p>    <p>      I'll be doing a bit of touring with Okie Doke in 1981, too.      So if you happen to hear we're going to be in your area,      come on out . . . I'd like to have a chance to meet the      people I write to! And, if you have any questions you'd      like me to address in this column, please contact me at my      <em>new</em> address: 18520 312th Avenue N E., Duvall,      Washington 98019.    </p>    <p>      Finally . . . many thanks to David Johnston, Rose LeClere,      David Cross, and Maddie MacNeil for the help they've given      me in preparing this column. You'll be reading more about      dulcimers here in the future!    </p>
