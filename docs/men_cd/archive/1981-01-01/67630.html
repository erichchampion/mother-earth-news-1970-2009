                <p>      Sometimes saving cash is a simple matter of being able to      see "junk" as "raw material".    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By William A. Shellberg    </h5>        <p>      After installing a woodburning fireplace insert last fall,      I was pleased to note that my household's heating oil      consumption dropped from the previous year's nearly 800      gallons to a mere 50! So, when I noted that I was then      buying more oil for the small space heater in my      workshop/garage than for our entire home, I decided that      the utility building ought to have a woodstove of its own!    </p>    <p>      Now, I wasn't <em>about</em> to invest in a readymade      heater for my workroom, but I'm a pretty enthusiastic      do-it-myselfer and figured I could come up with a design      that would get the job done. I began my "research" by      visiting a neighbor who'd built a stove from kit-supplied      components and a pair of 55-gallon drums. I was quite      impressed with his heater, too. However, when I added the      price of the kit to the cost of the 30-gallon containers      that I wanted to use (the drums go for up to $15 apiece in      my part of Michigan), I decided to look for another      solution.    </p>    <p>      Not long after making that decision, I happened to be      rummaging around in my barn and noticed that I had a goodly      supply of old auto tire rims stacked in one corner. The      steel doughnuts are made of pretty stout material, and I      figured that a car-rim heater should last a long time! So,      I borrowed an arc welder and set to work.    </p>            <p>      I first cut the centers out of most of the rims that would      form the firebox and the upper "heat exchange" cylinder.      (The lower chamber, as shown in the photos, consists of      four welded-together 14" rims . . . while the top cylinder      is made from three.) Scrap pipe (for the legs) and sheet      metal (which I used to form the ends of the heater and the      pipe collars) finished the job. I recycled the 6" stovepipe      that had been used on the garage's oil-burner, but did have      to buy two elbows to connect the upper and lower sections      of my stove.    </p>    <p>      To protect the connecting pipe sections from early burnout,      I decided <em>not</em> to remove the center from the last      rim in my stove's firebox, hoping the obstruction would      serve as a baffle. I <em>did</em> cut the "innards" from      all of the rims forming the stove's upper portion, but      don't know that it was really necessary to do so.    </p>    <p>      The total cost of my little workshop heater breaks down      like this: 7 rims (I had them on hand, but they can be      bought in this area for about $1.00 each), $7.00 . . . two      6" elbows (I used the least expensive I could find, at      $2.00 apiece), $4.00 . . . and three pounds of welding rod,      $3.00.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, even if I <em>had</em> gone out and      purchased the tire rims, I would have paid a scant $14 for      my workshop woodburner! The paltry amount I <em>did</em>      spend bought me a clanged <em>effective</em> little heater,      too. And I'm confident that anyone could duplicate the      stove. After all, it shouldn't take more than 15 minutes of      practice with a welder (have an experienced metal worker      show you the ropes, <em>and explain</em> safe working      practices) to learn to run an airtight-though not      very pretty-bead.    </p>    <p>      So borrow an arc welder, scrounge up some tire rims and      metal scraps, and give it a go! You'll end up with an "ugly      duckling" woodburner. . . <em>for</em> a downright      <em>beautiful</em> price!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Folks who are thinking of building their own      stoves, but would prefer a design that's more attractive      and versatile than Bill's tire-rim heater, might well find      what they're looking for in MOTHER's Woodburning Stove      Plans. The foolproof, step-by-step instructions will tell      you how to turn about $40 worth of materials into a custom      woodburner that will perform as well as many stoves costing      up to $500. (In fact, we've heard from readers who've built      the heaters and sold them for as much as $300!) If you're      interested, send $10 to MOTHER's Woodburning Stove Plans,      P.O.
