        <p>      The sweetest of all harvests goes to those folks who keep      honeybees, and the time to prepare to undertake such a      venture is now. But first you should understand...</p>     	<div calss="sidebar">     <p>      <em>The world of men is always uncertain, seldom inspiring,      often a source of discouragement and dismay. But the keeper      of bees, like anyone who has welded his life to the cycles      and patterns of nature, can always turn to his tiny      creatures and his craft ....</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Even as a boy, driven by the passions and impulses that      make youth so tumultuous and blind and filled with folly, I      noted [the] serenity in beekeepers. From time to time I      would see one sitting out in his battered chair, basking in      the peace and sweetness of the setting . . . while around      him, in spring, the cherries bloomed and the bees hummed,      just as they had for a million springs gone by, and as they      will for more millions to come.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Richard Taylor<br /></em> The Joys of Beekeeping    </p></div>    <p>      The picture of a serene individual calmly tending to the      "little golden folk" in his or her beehive presents a rare      and heartwarming example of how humans can sometimes work      in cooperation with the natural world. Yet although      <em>experienced</em> beekeepers may lyrically praise the      sweetness of both their labors and their harvests, most      people find the idea of actually caretaking a hive to be      quite intimidating.    </p>    <p>      Folks are often frightened by the mere <em>thought</em> of      tending to a colony of 30,000 to 80.000 stinger-laden and      venom-carrying flying insects. And individuals who do feel      inclined to learn this seemingly mysterious art find that      many beekeeping how-to guides plunge into such bewildering      barrages of complicated explanations that the books      actually <em>add</em> to the readers' muddle ment.    </p>    <p>      Well, in spite of the fact that bees do have stingers, that      many texts <em>do</em> seem-especially <em>at      first</em> -to be almost unintelligible, and that no      beginner can become an expert (and sagaciously serene)      beekeeper in a single honey season . . . it is quite      possible for an interested novice to learn to work bees and      harvest honey.    </p>    <p>      As long as there are nectar- and pollen-bearing flowers in      your area, you can become a hobbyist beekeeper and      successfully manage one or more hives to produce all the      fresh unadulterated honey you (and your friends!) can use.      This fact holds true even if you live in the middle of a      large city, as many urban beekeepers keep hives of      honeymakers on apartment house roofs or in attics! (Before      doing so, however, city dwellers should check their local      ordinances.)    </p>    <p>      This article, then, will <em>introduce</em> you to the      field of beekeeping. It won't pretend to reveal      <em>all</em> you need to know to undertake backyard      apiculture (much of that information can be had solely      through study and experience) . . . but it should give you      a feel for what's entailed in the endeavor and, perhaps, a      desire to try your hand at tending bees.    </p>	<h3>BUT WHAT ABOUT STINGS?</h3>                <p>      However, getting stung is not a disaster. Sure, it hurts .      . . but most beekeepers soon build up an immunity to the      venom itself, and eventually suffer no aftereffects from      such incidents. (A small <em>minority</em> of people,      though, are especially allergic to bee stings . . . and      their sensitivity may <em>increase</em> with time. Such      folks should not, of course, even attempt to keep bees.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, there's a "secret" technique you can use to      greatly reduce the amount of venom you <em>absorb</em> from      those occasional stings. Simply use a fingernail (or some      other thin-edged object) to scrape the "bee needle" out      immediately . . . otherwise, the stinger's venom sack will      continue to pump poison into your flesh for a minute or      more. (Don't try to grab the stinger with your      fingers-as so many people do-or you'll actually      squeeze even <em>more</em> venom into your system.)    </p>    <p>      That beekeeper's trick will greatly reduce the damage      inflicted by stings . . . but, of course, your goal will be      to get stung as little as possible while tending hives. And      the following tips should greatly reduce the number of      "injections" you receive.    </p>    <p>      [1] Wear a snug ("beetight") veil and <em>light-</em>      colored clothing. (White coveralls are excellent for      beekeeping ... blue jeans are poor.) Eliminate any      "crawlin" spaces between your garments and skin by tucking      your pants legs into your socks and, possibly, wrapping      rubber bands around your shirt sleeves. Do <em>not</em>      wear wool. And consider <em>not</em> wearing protective      gloves. (During the first few months, you may feel more      comfortable if you <em>do</em> don the hand shields, but      eventually you'll probably find that it's easier to work a      hive, <em>without</em> crushing bees, when you're      barehanded.)    </p>    <p>      [2] Do <em>not</em> wear clothes that have previously      received stings. Bees release a banana-scented pheromone      when they strike . . . to alert their comrades to the      threat <em>and</em> summon other bees to sting the same      area. So wearing garments that are still scented with that      alarm odor is literally <em>asking</em> to be stung.    </p>    <p>      [3] Always use a <em>smoker</em> . The portable      bellows/firebox combination (a standard piece of beekeeping      equipment) enables you to puff plumes of smoke into the      beehive. And for some reason-perhaps because the      nectar gatherers believe they're getting ready to flee from      a forest fire-bees engorge themselves with honey      whenever they smell smoke... and become much less      aggressive toward intruders. (A smoker is also useful for      temporarily covering up the scent of a bee's alarm      pheromone if you do get stung.)    </p>    <p>      [4] Whenever possible, visit the bees on a warm, sunny,      windless day when plenty of nectar-bearing flowers are in      bloom (or, as beekeepers say, when there's a <em>honey</em>      <em>flow</em> ). On such occasions many of the insects will      be out working in the fields . . . and the stay-at-homes      will be so busy with their own labors that they'll hardly      notice your presence.    </p>    <p>      [5] Don't block the hive entrance with your body. Tend the      bee house from the side or back.    </p>    <p>      [6] Try to make all your movements calm, evenly paced, and      efficiently purposeful. Don't alarm the insects by moving      jerkily or hastily . . . or try their patience by taking      more time than you should. (Of course, such poise may not      come naturally at first. Keep trying, and your skills and      demeanor will soon improve. And, if at all possible, get      some experience working with other beekeepers . . . a lot      of their self-assurance will rub off on <em>you</em> .)    </p>    <h3>THE HIVE: PARTS AND MEMBERS</h3>    <p>      Before you can begin beekeeping, you need to know a bit      about the equipment and community you'll be working with.      The modern beehive was devised-in 1851-by the      Reverend L.L. Langstroth. His design incorporated two vital      features that are standard today: movable, interchangeable      frames and uniform "bee space".    </p>    <p>      The fact that all the interior parts can be easily taken      out and moved about is-in Langstroth's      invention-what makes precise and nondestructive      manipulation of the hive possible. And since all the      internal pieces of equipment are separated by 5/16" spaces      (the size of passageway that bees naturally prefer), the      insects usually won't be tempted to close off their "halls"      by sticking the hive parts together with extra comb or bee      glue (propolis).    </p>    <p>      The basic parts of the bees' home are a <em>hive stand, a      bottom board</em> , inner and <em>outer top covers</em> ,      and-most important of all-open boxes, or      <em>supers,</em> that make up the body of the hive. Inside      every one of the bee-housing boxes are eight to ten      <em>frames</em> (or <em>racks</em> ), and each of these      removable rectangles contains a thin sheet of beeswax      imprinted with hexagons the size of a worker bee cell. Such      sheets of foundation give the bees ordered starting points      for drawing out either egg or honey cells.    </p>    <p>      The main hive body, or <em>brood chamber</em> (sometimes      called a <em>deep super</em> ) is 9-5/8" high and used to      house the queen and her eggs ( <em>brood</em> ). Many      beekeepers like to keep two brood chambers on each hive.    </p>    <p>      The shorter boxes, or <em>shallow supers</em> (most      frequently referred to simply as <em>supers</em> ), are      only 5-3/4" tall. They are stacked on top of the brood      chamber(s) and used primarily for storing honey.    </p>    <p>      The members of a hive colony are one <em>queen bee</em> ,      thousands upon thousands of worker bees, and a random (but,      in the most productive hives, small) number of drone bees.      The queen, the most longlived member of the colony,      resembles a worker bee with an enlarged abdomen. After her      few youthful mating flights, she spends the rest of her      life (as long as seven years) in the hive, performing one      function: laying eggs . . . to the tune of more than 1,500      a day during the peak of each season!    </p>    <p>      The worker bees are all females that lack fully developed      reproductive organs. These multitudes of industrious      insects run the hive . . . feed and clean up after the      queen . . . gather honey, pollen, and water . . . keep the      internal temperature of the hive constant (they can both      cool and heat their enclosed environment!) . . . feed the      larvae . . . <em>and</em> build all the honey and brood      comb! (No wonder they're called workers!)    </p>    <p>      In contrast, the drones--very large, very <em>indolent</em>      male bees-never lift an antenna to help out around      the place, but simply eat honey (that's why you don't want      too many of them in your hive) while waiting for an      opportunity to mate with a young queen (a fatal-but,      one must hope fulfilling-experience).    </p>        <h3>      HOW TO GET STARTED KEEPING BEES    </h3>    <p>      In order to begin raising bees, you'll have to get some      equipment. The two biggest U.S. suppliers of beekeeping      gear are Dadant & Sons. Inc. (Dept. TMEN, Hamilton,      Illinois 62341) and the A.I. Root Co. (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      706. Medina, Ohio 44256). Both can provide excellent      equipment, including beginner's kits that consist of      everything you need to get started-except bees and      honey supers-and sell for around $75. (Some less      expensive beekeeping supply companies run ads in the      magazines listed in this article's sidebar.)    </p>    <p>      When it's time to obtain your "winged livestock", you can      either [1] mail-order a nucleus of "package bees", [2] buy      a working hive from a local beekeeper, or [3] catch a wild      swarm.    </p>    <p>      Catching a swarm isn't really as difficult as you might      imagine: The tight, homeless clusters of bees-usually      seen hanging from tree limbs, posts, or shrubs-tend      to be remarkably mild-mannered. Still, if you've never      handled bees before (or if you don't want to depend on the      chance occurrence of <em>finding</em> a swarm), you may      prefer to start out by <em>purchasing</em> your      honeymakers.    </p>    <p>      It's often possible to buy a strong established colony from      a local beekeeper. Such a working community may cost around      $100, but for that price you should get about 50,000 bees      along with a complete hive (you'll still have to purchase      such gear as a veil and smoker), and-if subsequent      weather and honey flows permit-you ought to be able      to harvest 50 to 100 pounds of honey your first season.    </p>    <p>      Many states require that such purchases be examined by a      bee inspector (contact the agent through your county      agricultural extension service). The examiner will inspect      the colony for signs of highly contagious bee diseases,      such as American foulbrood. (If you <em>don't</em> have an      inspector look into your hive, you should both expect the      seller to go through the hive in your presence ... and have      <em>read</em> enough to be able to spot problems      <em>yourself</em> .)    </p>    <p>      Some beginners start their colonies with mail-ordered      package bees (a cluster costs around $25), and this is      surely the safest way to be sure you're buying the kind of      bees you want. (There are several varieties of <em>Apis      mellifera</em> , but the vast majority are variants of the      "Italian" strain.)    </p>    <p>      If you choose to go the package route, however, you should      place your order as soon as possible . . . because most bee      suppliers will become quite busy in the warming months      ahead. Your package-which will be shipped four to six      weeks before the first spring bloom-will contain a      healthy, mated young queen . . . two or three pounds of      worker bees . . . a can of syrup for the insects to eat      <em>en route</em> , and complete instructions for both      installing the colony in your hive and feeding its members      until the first honey flow. This method costs less      initially than buying a working hive, but remember      that-since you'll be starting out with a small      nucleus-your new bee community may not make any      <em>surplus</em> honey (beyond their own wintering food      needs) during the first year.    </p>    <h3>COMB OR LIQUID</h3>    <p>      After your bees are in place and prospering, you should      consider adding your first honey super to the hive. But      before you can take this step to expand your colony's      lodgings, you'll have to make another fundamental      beekeeping decision: whether to harvest comb (chunk) or      liquid (extracted) honey.    </p>    <p>      Chunk honey, you see, is produced in frames that contain      thin, chewable foundation . . . while the foundation used      for honey that is to be <em>extracted</em> must be thicker      and reinforced with either preset or hand-inserted wires      (so that it will be sturdy enough to withstand the pressure      of the centrifuge machine, called a honey extractor, that      spins the liquid harvest out of its combs).    </p>    <p>      As a beginner, you'll probably encounter less trouble and      expense if you start off using comb foundations. By doing      so, you'll be able to harvest your golden goody by simply      cutting the honeycomb and all-out of the frames.      Then, if you want to separate some <em>liquid</em> honey      out of the yield, you can smash all the comb cells with a      kraut chopper (or a beater from an electric mixer) and let      the honey drain out through a small-mesh screen lined with      cheesecloth.    </p>    <p>      Heat and then cool the leftover comb shards in a double      boiler, too, and you'll gain some more honey . . . topped      by a solid layer of yellow beeswax. (Don't throw that      substance out! You can either use it for making wonderful      candles or save it until you accumulate enough to sell . .      . to bee supply companies, other beekeepers, or craft      shops.)    </p>    <p>      Because bees use a lot of honey and energy while building      their combs, you can harvest about 50% <em>more</em> honey      from your hive if you extract the sweetener and reinstall      the still-intact cells in the hive . . . rather than cut      the combs out altogether. All, but there's a rub: The      smallest handcranked extractors cost around $150 . . . more      than all the other one-hive start-up expenses combined!    </p>    <p>      However, if you want the increased yield possible with      extracted honey <em>without</em> the full expense of      purchasing the necessary machine, you might be able to      share the purchase cost of an extractor with some other      small-scale beekeepers . . . or pay (with honey) a nearby      commercial apiarist to do your comb/honey separating.      [EDITOR'S NOTE: There's another solution as well! We'll      publish the complete instructions for building your own      inexpensive honey extractor in MOTHER NO. 68.]    </p>    <h3>A VISIT TO YOUR HIVE</h3>    <p>      To give you a better feel for what it'll be like to tend a      "flock" of insect livestock, let's pretend that it's a      sunny day in June. Wildflowers are blooming like crazy,      your hive seems to be prospering (in fact, you added a      honey super to it two weeks ago), and you're a mite curious      as to just how well those bees are doing. In short, it's a      perfect day to inspect your little apiary.    </p>    <p>      Having donned your beetight garments and started a steady      fume-producing flame in your smoker, you approach the      <em>hive</em> from the side and watch for a moment. Yep,      there's a good honey flow on. Plenty of bees are flying in      and out of the wooden home . . . and the ones coming back      are so laden with nectar (bees convert that substance to      honey inside the hive) that they almost "droop" their way      through the air.    </p>    <p>      So, you put the tip of your smoker right in the mouth of      the hive's low entrance and puff a couple of clouds into      the brood chamber. The bees near the entrance buzz around a      bit, but soon most of them go into the hive.    </p>    <p>      A minute later, you lift off the hive's outer cover and      blow smoke down the narrow hole in the inner lid. You wait      for a short time after this . . . then, using your handy      hive tool (an inexpensive crowbarlike implement that's an      indispensable beekeeper's aid), you pry the Inner cover's      corners loose and lift that thin top off.    </p>    <p>      Using your hive tool as a lever, you now carefully pry up      one corner of a spare frame until you can grab that rack's      wooden top edge with one hand. You then pry up the opposite      top corner, grab that end, too, andpulling slowly so you      don't crush any workerslift the entire bee covered frame      out of the hive. Some of the cells you examine are capped      with white beeswax (indicating the presence of      ready-to-harvest honey). Most of the hexagonal units,      though, are unsealed and contain clearly visible honey.      Since such ambrosia needs further curing by the bees, you      know it's not yet time to make your first harvest.    </p>    <p>      In fact, you're just about to seal up the hive and leave      for the day when you recall an old apiarist's saying:      "There're two kinds of folks who fool with honeybees: the      bee <em>keepers</em> (those who conscientiously work with      their bees) . . and the bee- <em>havers</em> (the sluggards      who <em>have</em> hives but for the most part leave their      bees to the insects' own good or ill fortunes)." You know      that the chief trait distinguishing a beekeeper from a      beehaver is the willingness to examine and learn from the      brood chamber . . . the heart of the hive. So, since you'd      like to become a <em>true</em> apiarist, you decide to take      a practice "trip" into your main hive body and see how your      queen is doing.    </p>    <p>      After carefully replacing the frame you'd previously taken      out, you give the entire super a few puffs with your smoker      and then start prying that honey-holding box free from the      brood chamber. Even though the super has been on the hive      only a short while, the bees have already stuck it tightly      to the brood box, and you have to free all four corners      carefully with your hive tool and then slowly twist the      upper story <em>sideways</em> to break the gummy seals.    </p>    <p>      The super's not very heavy (if it were full, it would weigh      at least 40 pounds), so you're able to lift it off easily      and set it on the overturned outer cover. You then grab      your smoker again and give the bees at the top of the brood      chamber a few brief puffs.    </p>    <p>      One by one, now, you pull out a few separate frames from      the central hive "room". Except for the less occupied outer      racks, each frame you examine is-as some beekeepers      say-"slam full of brood". A large semicircle of dark      convex cappings covers much of the surface (some cells      contain uncapped white larvae) . . . and honey or pollen is      stored in the frames' corners.    </p>    <p>      You don't happen to spot the queen as you forage through      the chamber. (Many beginners stare at the moving masses of      bees in their hives and despair of <em>ever</em>      identifying the large-abdomened egg-layer. But rest assured      that-as another oldtime beekeeping saying      states-"you'll know her when you see her".) However,      since your colony is so full of fine brood, the hive is      obviously healthy and "queenright". So you don't bother the      bees by needlessly searching for her today but, instead,      carefully reassemble the hive and head back home.    </p>    <p>      To give this tale a sweet ending, though, let's come back      to the scene a week later. By now, your honey crop is 80%      sealed and ready to harvest. Of course, you <em>could</em>      leave a "one-way bee escape" (a gateway that lets bees out      but not <em>in</em> ) under the super, walk off, and reap      insect-empty racks in a day or so. But you've just got too      much of a hankering for some homegrown honey to wait, so      you pull out the sweet-filled frames one by one and simply      sweep all the bees off with a soft-bristled brush-the      critters don't seem to mind, either!-and take your      golden gatherings home.    </p>    <h3>BEEKEEPING'S VITAL SEASON</h3>    <p>      Every beekeeping season has its own annual tasks. Summer      work includes jobs such as adding supers and perhaps      harvesting. Fall is the time to make sure your bees have      all their winter stores built up. And, before winter hits,      you need to add some hardware cloth to your hives'      entrances (to keep out mice) <em>and</em> start assembling      gear for next year.    </p>    <p>      But the most crucial beekeeping season is surely the      spring. Many colonies-having made it through the      winter on their own supplies and ready to begin foraging      anew-are then faced with a few change-of-season weeks      when no harvestable flowers have yet bloomed. If the      nectar-gatherers don't have enough extra stores to see      themselves through this increasingly active period,      <em>you'll</em> have to provide some sugar or honey syrup      (and perhaps some pollen or pollen substitute). Otherwise,      your bees may have survived the winter . . . only to starve      in the spring!    </p>    <p>      The warming weather after along winter brings yet      <em>another</em> threat to your colony's productivity:      swarming. In the wild, bee colonies      reproduce-annually-by division: Many of the      workers and the old queen emerge from the hive and fly off      to find a new home. If your bees swarm, a new "replacement"      queen and some workers will be left behind to carry on. But      much of your best winged livestock will have flown the      coop, so the hive will probably not produce a good honey      crop the following season.    </p>    <p>      Although you can take <em>some</em> hive-saving steps, you      won't prevent <em>all</em> swarms from occurring. You      might, however, balance your losses with gains, since      spring is also the season to catch stray runaway clusters      and thus increase the number of hives in your apiary!    </p>    <p>      The danger of swarming-as well as the quality and      number of bees that do desert the hive in such      instances-decreases as spring turns to summer. As an      old nursery rhyme notes: "A swarm in May is worth a load of      hay. A swarm in June is worth a silver spoon. But a swarm      in July isn't worth a fly."    </p>    <h3>SWEET REWARDS</h3>    <p>      If you take up beekeeping and manage your honeymakers with      care, you'll have the pleasure of learning about one of      nature's most intriguing phenomena. (The intricate patterns      of bee behavior provide continual discoveries to the most      experienced apiarist.) In addition, you'll begin to      understand how to cooperate with-rather than lord      over-the only livestock creatures whose wills have      never been crippled by domestication.    </p>    <p>      And although this article has emphasized the commitment and      labor that beekeeping will require of <em>you</em> , the      colony's caretaker, you'll probably learn to feel humble      when you compare your efforts to those of your winged      partners. For, as long-time beekeeper Richard Taylor has      artfully phrased it, "The truly monumental work of      apiculture is always done by the bees themselves."    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: MOTHER would like to thank Bill and Nancy      McCullough (leaders of our summer beekeeping seminar),      Lawrence Goltz (editor of Gleanings in Bee Culture), and      several thousand Apis mellifera for their help in gathering      much of the information related in this article.    </p>
