                <p>      There's a "good thing growin'" in the middle of Los Angeles    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Russ Novak    </h5>                        <p>      There's a "good thing growin'" in the middle of Los Angeles    </p>    <p>      If you wander around in West Los Angeles, you might come      upon a sight that's sure to warm any back-to-the-lander's      heart. There, on a hillside boasting a view (on clear days)      of the Pacific, is a replica of the traditional household      vege table plot . . . expanded a hundredfold!    </p>    <p>      During the winter months, Ocean View Farms announces its      presence only by an unobtrusive sign at the entrance to the      Little League field which adjoins it. In the spring and      summer, however, the land shouts a <em>different</em>      story: The yellow green of fresh produce and the brilliance      of flowers proclaim that this isn't just another open space      awaiting condominium conversion.    </p>    <p>      A PASSEL OF PRIVATE PLOTS    </p>    <p>      Since the urban agricultural experiment got underway in      1977, Ocean View Farms has offered area residents an      opportunity to cultivate more than just the hanging plants      in their apartment windows. Plots are currently leased for      $14 per year, and the gardeners report that the      soil-although it's a bit sandy that close to the      sea-can be very productive . . . once it has been      properly rebuilt.    </p>    <p>      According to the current OVF chairman (George Dodds, who's      been involved with the project since its inception), the      idea originated in meetings between representatives of      CETA, the Los Angeles mayor's office, and other      governmental and community organizations.    </p>    <p>      "We had long periods that were all talk and <em>no</em>      action," he said of the nebulous beginnings common to so      many grassroots community projects. After months of      frustration, though, some suitable unused land was located      . . . but-since the area in question had a view of      the coast, good drainage, <em>and</em> access to the      "amenities" of city life-many thought that OVF (and      its Little League neighbor) wouldn't last long before it      fell prey to the machinations of urban developers.    </p>    <p>      And, as a matter of fact, the property is surrounded on all      sides by housing . . . with apartments and condos smack up      against its southern boundary. But the urban sprawl has      been stayed, in this case, by the landowner: the L.A.      Department of Water and Power (which originally planned to      put a reservoir on the site . . . a project whose      completion now seems unlikely).    </p>    <p>      A HEALING AGENT    </p>    <p>      Today-on land donated by city departments that had      idle acres under their jurisdiction-there are similar      projects underway (each with its own organizers) in other      parts of Los Angeles. So the urban farmers of OVF, isolated      as they are, are not completely alone in their      determination not to allow city life to divorce them from      the land that we <em>all</em> depend upon. ( Come to think      of it, metropolitan gardens are a little like healing      agents invading the bodies of malignant growths on the      planet!)    </p>    <p>      Summer afternoons-on weekends especially-see      dozens of city dwellers involved in the kind of work that      has sustained humankind for thousands of years. And      <em>besides</em> the satisfaction of eating the fruits of      their own labor, these gardeners also know exactly      <em>how</em> their food was grown . . . a rare piece of      knowledge to have in a city today!    </p>    <p>      Ocean View Farms may not be the country homestead that many      of its participants dream about, but it is a big leap in      the right direction. Furthermore, it's a fine example of      what a few persistent people can do in less than ideal      surroundings.    </p>    <p>      Maybe possibilities for a similar project exist in      <em>your</em> neck of the precincts . . . and now's the      time to start searching and organizing so that you'll have      all the talk behind you, and the action well underway,      before spring-and planting time-arrives. Making      an urban community garden happen may be a chore, but the      new Los Angeles farmers-with fresh tomatoes and salad      greens in hand-will tell you that it's <em>worth</em>      it!    </p>
