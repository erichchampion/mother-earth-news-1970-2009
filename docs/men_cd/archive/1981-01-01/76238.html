                    <p>  Selected doin's of well-known MOTHER-types from around the      world.    </p>    <h3>     BILLY LOVETT    </h3>        <p>      There are probably some Georgians who'd like to run Billy      Lovett out of town . . . but to many <em>other</em>      residents of the Peach State, the young Public Service      Commissioner's honesty and forthright opinions come as a      welcome relief from the murky and condescending rhetoric      folks usually receive from government officials.    </p>    <p>      Since joining the Commission a little over two years ago,      Lovett has leveled a series of unrelenting attacks on the      utility companies of his state, <em>and</em> on constant      rate hikes. In fact-last spring-he successfully      led the opposition to House Bill 1252, which would have      approved a $120 million increase in the cost of electricity      generated by Georgia Power!    </p>    <p>      Lovett called that piece of legislation "the greatest hoax      since the Yazoo Land Fraud", because it would have required      Georgia Power's customers to foot the bill for a number of      power plants being constructed by the utility company . . .      facilities which, Lovett maintains, are totally      <em>unnecessary</em> (as evidenced by Georgia Power's plans      to <em>sell</em> the plants to out-of-state utilities).    </p>    <p>      Not even his own colleagues are safe from Lovett's attacks.      In November of 1979, he opposed a move to make the PSC      members appointed officials (they are now elected for terms      of six years) . . . and even urged that some of the      longtime members of the board not be reelected when their      terms expired. Several of those officials, he said, had      fallen under the influence of the utility lobby and had      lost touch with the general public they were      <em>supposed</em> to be serving.    </p>    <p>      Commissioner Lovett is also an outspoken proponent of      alternative energy sources. Maintaining that "we must      decrease and eventually eliminate our dependence on      nonrenewable resources and on activities destructive to the      environ ment", he has published a 30-page proposal entitled      "Meeting Georgia's Energy Needs in the 1980's". Lovett's      energy plan, which he says is "designed for the people, not      the utilities", recommends the establishment of a State      Energy Efficiency Development (SEED) Authority, which would      provide interest-free loans to residential consumers for      the construction and use of alternative energy      devices.-JM.    </p>    <h3>BIRCH BAYH</h3>    <p>      Before he was defeated in the November 1980 election,      Senator Birch Bayh of Indiana provided a strong voice for      ecology and alternative energy in the Senate. In addition      to backing such environmental measures as the expansion of      the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and the protection of      national forest lands in his home state, the former      legislator helped stop the construction of several proposed      dams . . . and was successful in amending a bill that      authorizes the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to impose      criminal penalties on deliberate violators of safety      regulations. Senator Bayh also emerged-during his      three terms on Capitol Hill-as a dedicated supporter      of humane animal treatment.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps Bayh's most important activity of the <em>last</em>      two years, however, was serving as the Chairman of the      National Alcohol Fuels Commission. The board's      assignment-during its 18-month life span-was to      study alcohol fuel potential and offer specific      recommendations to the President and Congress for expanding      the country's use of alternative sources of energy.    </p>    <p>      The committee held public hearings in Washington, sponsored      ethanol and methanol research, and urged the government to      play a leading role in advocating the use of such fuels.      Bayh and ten other Congressional members of the Commission      wrote to President Carter last fall, expressing concern      over the slow progress of efforts to convert the U.S. to      gasohol. The letter pointed out that the Federal government      purchased over 340 million gallons of fuel in 1979 to run      its enormous motor fleet, of which only 13 million gallons      (or 4% of the total) was gasohol. The Commission urged the      Chief Executive to beef up the government's purchasing      program for the home-brewed fuel . . . and thus stimulate a      market for the product.    </p>    <p>      Senator Bayh, in explaining his reasons for supporting the      ethanol movement, says: "Alcohol fuels provide us with the      opportunity to declare our energy independence. In fact, I      think we ought to be turning our farms into energy      factories." -JM.    </p>    <h3>JULIA CHILD</h3>        <p>      Julia Child is constantly asked to endorse kitchen and food      products . . . but the <em>chef de cuisine      extraordinaire</em> declares that she's determined to      remain free to speak her own mind. And, although she minces      a lot of fresh vegetables, Ms. Child minces no words when      it comes to pointing out what she sees as dishonest food      magazines ( "one publication has a policy never to      criticize its advertisers, so its restaurant reviews are      meaningless") . . . poorly designed products ("the Sunbeam      mixer has been on the market for 40 years, but it won't      even beat egg whites properly") . . . and the National      Heart Association ( "since it's supported by a cooking oil      company, <em>of course</em> you can't trust the      organization's warnings about heart disease and its      relation to cholesterol and heavy oils").    </p>    <p>      The plain-spoken gourmet-who, for many years, starred      in her own television cooking show, <em>The French      Chef-also</em> objects to the inferior cuts of meat      often sold by commercial butchers. (She recommends rabbits      as particularly useful homestead livestock, because their      meat is "inexpensive, delicious, low in fat, and meatier      than chicken".)    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, while she's quick to criticize items and      institutions that she disapproves of, the American-born      chef will sometimes lend her name to causes that she      considers worthy. For example, Ms. Child-who believes      that <em>"every</em> baby should be a wanted      child"-sponsored a recent fund-raising affair for      Planned Parenthood. <em>-Duane Valentry.</em>    </p>    <h3>IN BRIEF . . .    </h3>    <p>      Environmentalist JACQUES-YVES COUSTEAU (interviewed in      MOTHER NO. 5) has just produced-along with the staff      of the Cousteau Society-The <em>Cousteau Almanac of      the Environment,</em> which attempts to catalog      <em>all</em> life on earth (Doubleday, $15.95 in paperback,      appearing in bookstores in June) .... The faculty at Los      Angeles's International College-a nontraditional      "one-to-one" university-includes BUCKMINSTER FULLER      (interviewed in MOTHER NO. 9) and the poet quoted in our      first issue, GARY SNYDER.-JM.    </p>
