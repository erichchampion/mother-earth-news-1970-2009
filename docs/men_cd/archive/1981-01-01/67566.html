                  <p>You'll save money and have a happier, healthier pet when      you . . .</p>    	  <h5 id="byline">By B. Marian Rogers</h5>        <p>      I'd <em>like</em> to be able to tell you that my tabby got      sick just reading the label on a can of her food . . . but      honesty makes me admit that she can't read print that fine.      I can, however, and the list of ingredients made me feel      wretched.    </p>    <p>      Along with "modifieds", "by-products", "dioxides",      "hydrochlorides", and other "ides" and "-antes", there was      actually artificial coloring!    </p>    <p>      "For whom?" I asked myself. "For the cat, who surely      doesn't care ... or the owner, who even more surely      wouldn't eat the mixture?"    </p>    <p>      I would never dream of feeding myself or my family an      exclusive diet of preservative-laden, artificially colored,      modified, canned by-products . . . and I certainly felt      that my furry friend deserved better nourishment than the      commercial kitty dinners seemed to offer. In fact, I saw no      reason why I couldn't make nutritious meals that a feline      would like just as well as-and maybe a whole lot      better than-canned food!    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, since the price of cat food has kept pace with      inflation (the brand I bought three years ago, for 18 cents      a can, now costs 38 cents!), I figured that my own      homecooked cat-meals couldn't be much more expensive than      store-bought victuals!    </p>    <p>      After studying a lot of labels on "nutritionally complete"      diets for cats, I broke down the ingredients into several      main groups: proteins (liver, egg, fish, chicken, and beef)      with their own fats and oils . . . starches (wheat gluten,      soy flour, and modified starches) . . . and the various      vitamin supplements.    </p>    <h3>FREE INGREDIENTS</h3>    <p>      My first stop was the meat counter at the grocery store,      where I asked a number of questions and made some      interesting discoveries. Large fish, I learned, often      arrive whole but are sold in fillets, steaks, and other      dressed forms. Heads, tails, and bones-and all the      meat attached to such pieces-are thrown away. I      offered 10 cents a pound to cover the cost of the plastic      wrap, but the butcher insisted on giving me the castoffs      for free.    </p>    <p>      Pork liver, I already knew, was among the least expensive      of meats, closely followed by pork kidney and chicken      gizzards and hearts. Since <em>all</em> organ meat is      nutrient-rich, I bought a package of each. When I got home,      I knew immediately that I was on the right track, because      the cat followed the grocery bag into the house and licked      her whiskers expectantly while I unpacked it.    </p>    <h3>A FELINE FEAST</h3>    <p>      The fish was the messiest to deal with, but quite easy to      make into a feline feast. I put it in a pot . . . covered      it with water . . . and let it cook to a jellied mass      filled with chunks of bone. I then removed the largest      sections of skeleton with tongs and discarded them, but      left in the little soft ones. That done, I put the "soup"      through my food grinder while it was still hot and easy to      pour.    </p>    <p>      As a sample serving of <em>les petits os de poisson en      gelee</em> cooled, I added a handful of wheat germ. My      little gourmet loved the fishy delicacy, so I packaged it      in mealsize quantities and stored my supply in the freezer.    </p>    <p>      Encouraged by this experiment (which yielded around three      weeks' worth of food!), I turned to the other low-cost      meats. And, working by trial and error, I came up with the      following cat-tested recipes.    </p>    <p>      <em>ABATTIS EN RAGOUT</em>    </p>    <p>      To make this treat (which could also be called giblets in      broth), boil any combination of chicken gizzards, hearts,      and livers until they're tender and serve them whole with a      little warm broth. When you make a large quantity, chill      and freeze the giblets right in the liquid, so that they      won't lose moisture.    </p>    <p>      <em>FOIS DE COCHON AUX OEUFS</em>    </p>    <p>      You can save time and energy consumption by making this      pork-liver-with-raw-egg dish when you're using the oven for      something else. Just put the meat in a foil-overed pan with      a little water, and bake it until the liver is pink in the      center. Slice or grind it, and serve with a raw egg mixed      in.    </p>    <p>      <em>TARTELETTE DE</em> <em>ROGNON</em> A <em>LA KITTY</em>    </p>    <p>      To prepare a very healthful kidney pie for your kitty,      saut√© pork or beef kidney in a little rendered fat      or vegetable oil, then chop or grind it up. Mix the meat      with wheat germ or egg . . . or both.    </p>    <p>      <em>LA SOUPE DE POISSONS DU CHAT</em>    </p>    <p>      It's easy to make a fine fish chowder for your cat. Simply      cook four pounds of haddock or other fish heads and scraps      to a mush, and then remove the large bones. Grind up      everything that's left and stir in 1/2 cup of powdered      milk, 1 cup of grain products (from stale rye bread crumbs      to oatmeal), and up to 1/2 cup of such ingredients as      cheese rinds, chopped outer vegetable leaves, cooked      carrots, macaroni and cheese, chicken rice soup . . . or      whatever healthful odds and ends you have. Mix the      concoction well and freeze it in onemeal portions    </p>    <p>      Other leftovers that can be added to a chowder-or fed      to your cat "straight up"-are cottage cheese, cooked      rice, pasta, the cereal the baby didn't eat (assuming you      don't feed the youngster <em>sweetened</em> cereal), and      almost any other vegetable or grain product. (And, if you      think your feline ought to have a vitamin supplement to      provide those "boosters" contained in commercial cat food,      most pet stores carry a variety of cat vitamins.)    </p>    <p>      A quick cost analysis will show that-even when using      only <em>purchased</em> meats at regular      prices-homemade cat meals will cost less than      <em>half</em> as much as the store-bought variety . . . and      they're all good nutritious food, without fillers,      emulsifiers, <em>or</em> artificial coloring.    </p>    <p>      Best of all, your pussycat will be purrfectly delighted!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you happen to have a dog as a pet, be      sure to check out the article "Feed Your Dog for Free" on      page 114 of this issue.    </p>
