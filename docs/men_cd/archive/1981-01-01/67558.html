                    <p>      Successful Organic Farming... For 30 years!    </p>        <p>      <em>You don't find many pioneers like A. P. Thomson      anymore: He's a man who-more than 30 years      ago-had the courage and foresight to buck the trend      and put his maverick beliefs into practice</em> . . .      despite <em>the suspicion and skepticism of folks who just      couldn't</em> understand <em>his vision.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A.P., you see, is an apple grower (just as his</em>      grandfather <em>was) . . . but-unlike most modern      commercial orchardists-this Virginian has never used      a single "agribiz" chemical on his 35-acre farm in the      rolling countryside of the Shenandoah Valley. Every year,      Thomson's Golden Acres Orchard produces seven different      varieties of organically grown apples. . . in addition to      unfiltered apple juice</em> and <em>apple cider vinegar.      The pure products are sold-mostly by mail      order-to customers all over the United States . . .      including doctors, health food stores, co-ops, people who      are allergic to common agricultural chemicals, and hundreds      of individuals who simply prefer the fresh, untainted taste      of A.P.'s fruit.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>After years of research and experimentation, Thomson      has developed a system-consisting of a number of</em>      environmentally safe <em>treatments and methods-to maintain      his orchard's soil fertility, grow hardy trees, repel      insects and disease,</em> and <em>produce delicious apples      (a fruit which is traditionally among the most difficult      crops to grow without pesticide sprays).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Furthermore, A.P. is eager to</em> pass on <em>his      vision, and to spread the word about wholistic farming to      anyone who'll listen. He founded-in December of      1979-an organization called Friends of the Farm.      Headed by Thomson and Illinois agriculturist Robert Rowe,      FOF has already opened several demonstration sites across      the country . . . giving people opportunities to learn the      techniques of organic food production from actual working      operations (such as A.P.'s orchard).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Last autumn, MOTHER sent horticulturist Larry Hollar      and writer Jeanne Malmgren to the Old Dominion state to      visit A.P. at his Front Royal home. There, the amiable      Virginian took MOM's staffers on an extensive tour of his      orchard, cold storage warehouse, apple packing facility,      and experimental intensive garden. Afterward, Larry and      Jeanne spent several hours talking with Thomson in his      gracious, turn-of-the-century house, where they learned      more about the orchard-keeper's past and present work . . .      and about his hopes for the future. The following      transcript-which was edited from that      conversation-presents a portrait of the man . . . as      an agricultural researcher, a humanist, and a lifelong      "natural" farmer. We h</em> <em>ope you'll enjoy meeting A.      P. Thomson.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Mr. Thomson, evidence of your      devotion to the cause of organic growing is everywhere on      this farm: in the acres of healthy, unsprayed trees . . .      in the storage warehouse full of fragrant, wholesome fruit      . . . even in the 100-square-foot intensive vegetable plot      in the back yard. Can you tell us a little about the events      that led to your establishing a wholistic apple orchard?    </p>        <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> It was a long road that brought me here. Believe      it or not, when I was young I wanted to be a doctor. In      fact, I majored in chemistry at Washington and Lee      University, and even won an academic scholarship to Harvard      Medical School. But-since we were right in the middle      of the Depression then-my daddy, who was a farmer,      couldn't get up the money for my room and board. So I went      to Washington instead, and found a job at the Bureau of the      Mint . . . where I worked as a chemist until World War II      broke out.    </p>    <p>      During that conflict, I joined the Navy and spent a couple      of years at Pearl Harbor. While I was there, I often spent      my free time leafing through books in the PX . . . and      that's how I stumbled onto Louis Bromfield's farming      classic, <em>Pleasant Valley.</em>    </p>    <p>      Well sir, that little book really lit a spark in me. After      reading it, I understood <em>why</em> my father's fields      had eroded so badly and <em>why</em> our family's farm had      suffered from low productivity for years. Since I already      had an interest in nature and a strong desire to go back to      the farm, I began to study agriculture in earnest . . . and      I followed up all the references in Bromfield's book.    </p>    <p>      First, I wrote to Sir Albert Howard-who, as you know,      is considered the founder of organic gardening-in      England, and that initial contact led to a long      correspondence. I also got in touch with Lady Eve Balfour,      the first president of Great Britain's Soil Association,      and met her when she came to this country. Then I went to      Pennsylvania to visit J. I. Rodale-the founder of      <em>Organic Gardening and Farming</em> magazine-and      see his experiments.    </p>    <p>      Remember, at that time the concept of organic or natural      horticulture was still "new" . . . so I was very fortunate      to meet and learn from the real pioneers in the field. And,      as I became more knowledgeable, my interest grew and grew .      . . until I finally decided, "Well, by George, I'm going to      go back home and help my family make a living out of the      old place." The idea of starting an apple orchard had long      been on my mind . . . I guess because my granddaddy was an      orchardist. But when I returned to the family farmstead, I      found that it wasn't exactly an <em>ideal</em> place to      raise fruit trees. The soil was so poor my father couldn't      even grow enough corn to feed our one old cow . . . and      there were washed-out gullies you could hide a house in!    </p>    <p>      So I had a real challenge facing me. I knew, first of all,      that I'd have to revive that soil somehow. The top priority      was to level the land enough so that I could at least get a      <em>tractor</em> across it. With that accomplished, the      next step was to work organic matter and nitrogen back into      the earth . . . and the most logical way to do that, I      figured, was to plant a legume crop. After doing a little      research, I decided on sweet clover, for several reasons:      The seed was inexpensive, I knew the plants would grow in      our terrible soil, and I felt sure their root systems would      help prevent erosion. I sowed some bromegrass, too, and      that turned out to be a real mistake. It spread so fast      that it actually became a pest. In fact, that brome is only      now-after all these years-being choked out by      our area's native bluegrass!    </p>    <p>      During the first year of work in the orchard, we simply      mowed the sweet clover when it came up. Then, the following      summer, we worked it back into the soil at about the time      it bloomed, when its nitrogen content was highest. Next, we      planted cowpeas, and disked <em>them</em> under in the      fall. And, during the third autumn, we set out our first      apple trees. They were then interplanted with soybeans for      another three years, in order to insure a good ground      cover. Each fall, we would disk the leguminous crops into      the soil, giving the earth abundant organic matter and a      good supply of nitrogen.    </p>    <p>      Once the trees were well established, we let the brome and      the bluegrass grow up again . . . and planted <em>all      sorts</em> of legumes as well, including alsike, sweet      clover, lespedeza, and alfalfa. The goal of such      interplanting”a method that I learned from Sir Albert      Howard-is to create the diversity that nature loves.      Instead of setting up an artificial monoculture, we let      many different kinds of grasses and clovers grow right in      among the trees . . . and we've never had to replace those      particular crops.    </p>    <p>      Another task that was necessary, early in the game, was to      "sweeten" the earth a little, since the soil of this region      has a low pH. To reduce the acidity, we spread a lot of      ground limestone . . . but we overdid it at first. We      applied almost ten tons per acre over the course of one      year, and the young York apple trees-which were just      beginning to fruit-responded by producing a lot of      "corking" . . . that's a tough, corklike texture in the      apples. I soon realized that the condition was the result      of a boron deficiency, which we'd unintentionally created      by adding too much limestone to the soil.    </p>    <p>      Well, we tried to compensate for our error by working borax      into the earth, but it took the orchard years to fully      overcome the paralyzing effect of the single overdose of      limestone. That fact, I think, serves to emphasize the      importance of going into any farming venture with at least      some knowledge of soil chemistry. Of course, you're bound      to make mistakes when you start out-I did, in spite      of my master's degree in chemistry-simply because      learning a subject from a textbook is quite a different      thing from actually doing it. Still, you ought to have at      least a little understanding of what you're about before      you start messing with the earth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Can you tell us about the      specific biological techniques you've worked out for your      orchard? What do you use instead of the conventional sprays      and fertilizers?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> We first treated the land with a      biodynamic field spray developed by Dr. Ehrenfried      Pfeiffer, the renowned biochemist and biodynamic pioneer.      That preparation was applied when we were mowing the heavy      mass of grass that used to cover the area, in order to      provide bacteria to break down the greenery. Later, I      became interested in trace elements and their effects on      the soil, so I bought a fish emulsion to "beef up" the      soil's content of those important nutrients.    </p>    <p>      From such early experiments, we went on to use a      concentrated seaweed extract. We started with "Sea-born"      brand and then switched to "Maxicrop" . . . a      Norwegian-made concentrate that we've been quite satisfied      with. The seaweed is harvested in Scandinavia and sent to      Great Britain, where it's processed by sun-drying. I      believe that such natural dehydration is best, because the      enzymes aren't lost as they can be in the high-heat drying      procedures so often used in this country. I also avoid the      American-made kelp concentrates, simply because there's too      much water pollution along our shores. To my mind, Maxicrop      is the best.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What are the benefits of a      concentrated seaweed spray?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> As I see it, there are several      good reasons a grower would want to use seaweed on his or      her orchard or other crops. For one thing, the marine      fertilizer generally makes a plant healthier and better      able to resist insect attack. A seaweed spray, you see,      helps a tree-or any plant-absorb trace elements      from the soil . . . and those elements, in turn, assist in      the development of biotoxins, which are substances in the      leaf that act as natural insect repellents. We've never had      a problem with mites or aphids on our trees, and such pests      often cause major problems in other orchards. Seaweed also      causes a change in the configuration of leaf cells, which      helps the plant withstand temperatures as much as three      degrees lower than it normally could.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, it's important not to <em>overdo      the</em> application of concentrated seaweed, because the      substance has a growth regulator in it . . . and too heavy      a dose will stunt your trees' fruit. One year we had a lot      of smog here, and-since seaweed is said to be a      biological antidote for air pollution-I doubled our      usual application of Maxicrop . . . only to end up with a      lot of healthy, but <em>marble-sized, apples</em> on the      trees!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What do you consider the optimum      dosage, then, of seaweed spray?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> We use a mixture of two ounces of      the powdered concentrate to 100 gallons of water. There is      a liquid form of the substance available, but it contains      formaldehyde to prevent fermentation, so I prefer to use      the powder. We try to get the mixture on the trees once      every ten days-and no less than once every 15      days-from spring right up to harvest time. It's      especially important to apply it early in the growing      season-when the green first shows in the      buds-since the plant's absorption rate is highest at      that point in its development. The average gardener would      need to use only one tablespoon of the powder in one gallon      of water . . . and could spray it on his or her crops with      one of the little knapsack-type misters available in garden      stores and through catalogs.    </p>    <p>      We also apply a combination of the seaweed and the      biodynamic field spray in the fall, just before the leaves      drop. To make the preparation, we first mix five gallons of      water with six to eight ounces-about a level      teacup-of seaweed extract and a one-acre unit of      biodynamic field spray. [EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Pfeiffer's      product, which is sold under the brand name "B.D. Field      Spray", can be ordered from, the Pfeiffer Foundation, Dept.      TMEN, Threefold Farm, Spring Valley, New York 10977. A      one-acre unit costs $10, plus 70 cents postage . . . and a      five-unit bag sells for $45 postpaid. New York state      residents should add their local sales tax.]    </p>    <p>      This liquid is left alone for two or three days . . .      during that time it should be stored in an area where the      temperature won't drop below 65°F, so that the      foliage-decomposing organisms can grow. At the end of this      inoculation period-which shouldn't be longer than      three days, or you'll get too much fermentation-the      five-gallon batch of concentrate is diluted with 400      gallons of water, producing enough liquid for my whole      orchard. By the way, I prefer applying the spray with a      blower that can reach the <em>underside of</em> the leaf,      where all the liquid-absorbing stomata are concentrated.    </p>    <p>      This autumn spraying causes the foliage to begin bacterial      decomposition as soon as it falls to the ground. By      Christmas, the brittle leaves have crumbled, and are then      more readily devoured by earthworms and other organisms in      the soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What role do worms play in your      organic orchard management program?    </p>        <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> I first learned about the wonderful qualities of      these creatures in Thomas J. Barrett's book <em>Harnessing      the Earthworm.</em> From what I read there, and from my own      experience, I've concluded that the worm is one of the most      important components of an organic apple orchard ecosystem.      Burrowing vertically through the ground, the little      scavengers aerate the soil and bring trace elements up to      the surface. They eat organic material such as grass,      rotten apples, and decomposing leaves...run it through      their alimentary canals . . . and then excrete a highly      homogenized manure. All in all, I think the earthworm is      one of the <em>three most important</em> factors in any      natural garden. The others are the nutrient-supplying rock      substances in the soil, and the organic matter that's added      to make such nutrients more available.    </p>    <p>      The intensive propagation and use of earthworms is also a      tremendous tool in ridding the orchard of such diseases as      scab, which can be "carried"-from one season to      another-by fallen leaves. The worms completely ingest      the decomposing foliage and remove the danger of      reinfection. In addition, they open up the soil and help      assure proper circulation of water and air, thus allowing      for proper moisture runoff <em>and</em> the oxidation      necessary for organic decomposition.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, we propagated our initial supply of breeder      worms in a 24-inch compost bed. At regular two-week      intervals we "harvested" the top six inches of      soil-which contained the worms' egg cases-from      the bed. Then we spread that earth around the trees until      we'd covered the whole orchard, "as signing" approximately      8,000 worms to every individual tree. The crawlers hatched      out of the egg cases, began their beneficial work, and have      been at it ever since. And what work they do! One million      earthworms weigh one thousand pounds, and since the little      organisms eat and excrete about twice their weight daily in      order to survive, you can figure that a million earthworms      will translocate and enrich one ton of earth a day!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Is there any one species of worm      that's best to use in an orchard or garden?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Dr. Barrett's book says that      there are some two thousand species, I think . . . but he      developed <em>one</em> strain that's more adaptable to      varying environmental conditions than are "wild" worms.      That variety is called the red wiggler, and it's really the      best. Wigglers reproduce faster and are less susceptible to      drying out than most species. You can find the "new" worms      advertised in most farm and gardening magazines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Without using pesticides, how do      you keep rodents and insects out of your orchard?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> We actually use a combination of      <em>several</em> techniques to control rodents . . .      creatures which-by the way-represent our      biggest pest problem. Now here in Virginia we have two      kinds of mice: the pine mouse and the common meadow mouse.      The pine mouse is particularly dangerous to apple trees,      because it does all its damage underground . . . so the      orchard keeper can't know anything's wrong until a couple      of years <em>after</em> the harm's been done . . . when the      tree suddenly dies! This mouse-which looks like a      mole-has a very short tail, is almost blind, and      lives in underground burrows. By instinct, it builds its      nest right beneath the taproot of the tree . . . and then      tunnels along the main support roots during the winter.    </p>    <p>      The common field mouse, on the other hand, lives primarily      <em>aboveground</em> , in little nests it builds under      clumps of grass. This particular animal likes to munch on      the nutrient-containing cambium layer under the tree's      bark.    </p>    <p>      To deal with both pests, we first mow all around the base      of each tree to expose the field mouse nests . . . which      the mice will then abandon. The suction of the mower blade      also picks up the grass and blows it out to the dripline of      the tree, leaving an open area that's unsuitable for      creating <em>new</em> nests. Mowing around the trees helps      to chop up any apples that may have fallen to the ground,      too . . . thus making them decompose more rapidly.    </p>    <p>      Next, <em>carefully,</em> we put a teaspoonful of bait      containing a biodegradable poison-which we get from      the Fish and Wildlife Service of Amherst College-into      the opening of each of the little breather holes, also      uncovered by the mowing, that the pine mice dig. This toxin      is a zinc phosphide preparation that will kill the rodents      quickly. Now some people have criticized me for using the      poison, but it breaks down very speedily into its elemental      metals of zinc and phosphorus, both of which are beneficial      plant foods. Until we find another control method, it's      just something we <em>have</em> to do if we're going to      produce any fruit . . . and I'm extremely careful to use it      in such a way that it doesn't harm any other wildlife.    </p>    <p>      The mowing and poisoning usually need to be done only once      a year-right <em>after</em> the apples are      harvested-but it <em>may</em> be necessary to go back      over the orchard a second time, in February, if new rodents      have invaded the area.    </p>    <p>      To discourage <em>other</em> burrowing mammals-such      as groundhogs and rabbits-we simply use a heavy      gravel mulch. At the time we plant each tree, we spread      about one bushel-between 50 and 100 pounds-of      crushed rock around its base. I like to use a gravel called      Virginia Highway No. 5, a variety that isn't overly      expensive and is easy to shovel. We layer the stone mulch      about three or four inches deep, and extend the covering 12      to 18 inches out from the trunk of the tree. The gravel not      only discourages animals, but helps anchor the sapling and      keeps down weeds and other grasses. We also protect the      young tree trunks by wrapping them with flexible metal      guards. The zinccoated "sleeves"-which are actually      cut from the radiator grills of Mack trucks-are left      in place until the tree reaches a height of five feet or      so.    </p>    <p>      As for <em>insects,</em> our <em>basic</em> means of      defense is simply to grow hardy trees-using such      methods as the seaweed spray mentioned before-that      are highly pest-resistant. However, I've been experimenting      with a fascinating device I read about in Dr. Phillip      Callahan's book <em>Tuning In to Nature.</em> The entomol      ogist found that insect antennae contain extremely      sensitive cells that are attracted by light waves across      the entire spectrum. Following Dr. Callahan's model, I      positioned a small galvanized tub-with oil in      it-under two 15-watt bulbs . . . one incandescent and      one fluorescent, for maximum attraction. The bugs follow      their genetic impulses right to the lights, and then drown      in the oil. I set up my first insect-catcher at the edge of      our vegetable plot, and it caught codling moths by the      hundreds last summer! So I plan to put several of the      devices in the orchard next year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How do all your organic      techniques affect the production capacity of the trees?      Does your farm's yield compare well to that of a chemically      treated orchard?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Our production has averaged, over      the years, about 500 bushels per acre . . . and that figure      takes some normal frost damage into consideration. We have      grown-when the orchard was a bit younger and at its      peak of productivity-up to 26,000 bushels, or almost      750 bushels an acre! Last year we came out with 14,000      bushels . . . and the year before that, we had 15,000. But      this year we lost a lot of the crop to a severe hailstorm      in June, and produced only 4,000 bushels.    </p>    <p>      That natural disaster, of course, would have hurt a      commercial grower just as much as it affected us . . . but      the "chemical" orchards can stay ahead of us by using      acidulated fertilizers and hydrogenous compounds. Such      chemicals enable an orchardist almost to double the size of      the fruit and the yield of his or her acreage . . .      <em>if</em> the land has sufficient water to support the      "unnatural" growth. At present, I harvest an average of      15-and a <em>peak</em> of 23-bushels per tree .      . . while the commercial growers produce an average of 20      bushels per tree. I think that our type of operation is      more efficient in the long run, though, since it's less      energy-intensive and not dependent upon expensive      chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Our 35 acres are planted at a spacing of 38 X 40 feet,      which gives us 33 full-sized trees per acre. Some apple      growers are now going to dwarf varieties, which can be      planted 120 to 125 per acre. Such intensive planting, along      with good climatic conditions, has the potential to allow      an orchardist to raise two-maybe even      three--times as many apples as is possible with      standard trees!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY</strong> : Do you have any plans to convert      your orchard to dwarf trees?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Yes, we're gradually going over      to semidwarfs. They're about half the size of our present      stock . . . so we'll eventually have twice as many trees as      we do now. We're starting the process by replacing the      Yorks with new semistandard Winesaps, which are planted      <em>between</em> the existing trees. This makes a rather      tight arrangement right now. However, we'll achieve correct      semidwarf spacing-which will allow the trees to      gather sufficient sunlight-as the old stock is      removed and replaced . . . at a rate of about 100 trees a      year, according to our master plan. The new varieties are      on rootstocks that were developed in England . . . mostly      MM 111, MM 106, and EM 26. [EDITOR'S NOTE: These      designations refer to grafted rootstock developed at the      British research stations of Malling Merton and East      Merton.]    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Why do the old trees need to be      removed? Do they stop producing fruit altogether?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Well, an apple tree does have a      finite productive life span, beyond which its fruits just      keep getting smaller and scarcer. My theory is that the      tree has a sort of self-destruct mechanism in it, set to go      off after about 30 years. Once it reaches its peak of      productivity-and the older trees in my orchard have      long since done so-it starts going downhill. You can      give it a shot of adrenalin, in effect, by removing some      branches . . . and the tree might produce better for a      while. But it's really on its way out.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Mr. Thomson, have any tests been      performed on your apples to verify their purity and      nutritional quality?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> When we first started raising      organically grown fruit, some people just couldn't believe      that the apples hadn't been sprayed with chemical poisons .      . . and there <em>were</em> individuals who claimed that      any fruit so well-formed and goodtasting <em>must</em> have      been treated with the regular pesticides. So, to counteract      the rumors, we had the state's Department of Agriculture do      a test on our apples . . . and we came out totally in the      clear on the seven different chemicals that the examination      was geared to find.    </p>    <p>      Our apples also underwent a laboratory analysis by Dr.      Pfeiffer. That particular test involved the use of a      chromatograph, which separates a compound into its      individual elements. Well, Dr. Pfeiffer couldn't believe      the results of his own test. He said, "There must be      something wrong with my equipment . . . the apples just      couldn't be that high in biological purity. Let's try them      again next year, and see what happens." But the second      year's results corroborated those of the first year! And      Dr. Pfeiffer concluded, "Your apples have the highest      rating of any I've ever tested."    </p>    <p>      Later, Dr. T.L. Senn of Clemson University conducted an      analysis of our apples' trace element      content-measuring such beneficial minerals as      phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, calcium, zinc, copper,      manganese, iron, and sodium-and he recorded that our      fruit had almost <em>three times</em> the amounts usually      found in commercially grown apples.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What about your <em>not</em>      -so-perfect apples, the culls that don't quite live up to      Golden Acres' high standards? What do you do with them?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> There are always certain portions      of the harvest that-for one reason or      another-don't pass our inspection . . . although they      would qualify as USDA "commercial" grade. We use the      seconds to make juice and vinegar. By processing our      cull-grade apples into other salable products of high      quality, we're able to keep <em>down the</em> price of our      firstrate fruit!    </p>    <p>      Golden Acres unfiltered apple juice is turned out by a      stainless steel German press I bought 15 years ago. In one      30-minute run, that machine can produce 80 gallons of juice      from 1,000 pounds of groundup apples. We've reached the      point now where we can easily run 3,000 gallons a day . . .      but we usually stop at about 1,000 gallons daily. The      leftover pulp, of course, is turned into garden compost.    </p>    <p>      Our apple cider vinegar is made by a unique process that      allows the liquid to ferment slowly over along period of      time. Unlike most commercial operations-which use      40-foot towers, large blowers, and heat exchangers to      compress the entire fermentation/oxidation process into one      week-we let our juice ferment for at least a year,      during which time it's never exposed to any significant      changes in temperature. In fact, the temperature difference      between the liquid in the barrel and the outside air is      rarely more than three degrees . . . which means that none      of the aromatic substances that give vinegar its quality      and bouquet are lost in the process of fermentation. After      the oxidation is complete, we bottle the unpasteurized      elixir and ship it out to our customers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> How do you market your products?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> We cater mostly to folks who are      truly interested in natural and organically grown foods.      Instead of trying to sell to large supermarkets, we      concentrate on the smaller concerns, such as independently      owned health food stores and buyers' coops. Such markets      are proliferating all over the country, too . . . and the      wholistic farmer has got to take advantage of them. There's      a co-op in Norfolk, Virginia, for instance, that takes      three or four <em>thousand</em> gallons of our juice a year      . . . it's just a group of about 100 people who get      together and buy in bulk.    </p>    <p>      We sell 95% of our produce by mail order, to some 1,000      customers. Now they don't all order every year, it's true,      but most of them are very loyal. I'd estimate that about      100 of those men and women seek us out because they're so      allergic to pesticides they can't <em>eat</em> ordinary      apples. We ship our products to just about every state . .      . except California, and that's only because the local      government there won't let us send in apples unless they're      fumigated. Beginning immediately after harvest, the fruit      is shipped out weekly to people with prepaid orders. The      surplus is stored at 40°F in our controlledatmosphere      storage warehouse, and is used to fill any new orders until      December 1st. Our final shipping date is December 15th. We      sell apples by the bushel or the peck, juice in gallon      jugs, and vinegar in quarts and gallons.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Are you aware of many other      growers who are producing organically raised food for      market?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Oh, sure. We have eight or nine      people in this area alone who are raising "untreated"      vegetables and fruits. There's a lady nearby who has three      acres of organic strawberries . . . and a young man down in      Lexington, Virginia is just starting up a 35-acre wholistic      apple orchard, like this one. These people-and a      number of other like-minded folks-got together four      years ago to form the Virginia Association of Biological      Farmers, of which I'm a member. The group consists of men      and women who grow natural crops on a large scale, other      people who have small organic gardens, and representatives      of co-ops. We even have a committee that contacts markets,      and then lets the members know where there might be a      demand for their particular products. It's really a      wonderful working organization, because we all try to help      each other in every way that we can.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Is there anything comparable to      this on the national level?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Well, the situation is in a state      of flux right now, but I can see tremendous growth ahead      for similar national organizations. I'm currently involved      in the development of Friends of the Farm, which is an      offshoot of an earlier group called Natural Foods      Associates. For many years, the NFA-through      conventions and lectures-worked to show the link      between human metabolic diseases and the inferior quality      of the chemically produced foods people eat.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, the group became rather top-heavy with doctors.      Of the 33 people on the board of directors, only two were      practicing farmers, and the emphasis came to be more and      more on the medical aspects of nutrition. We were telling      folks they ought to eat fruits and vegetables grown without      poisons, but we weren't teaching them how to      <em>produce</em> that sort of food!    </p>    <p>      So some of us in the organization proposed setting up      demonstration gardens at the NFA headquarters in Atlanta,      Texas . . . where we could instruct people in the basics of      wholistic horticulture.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the other members of the 'board wouldn't      hear of it, as they felt that the plan would cost too much      money. Not only did they veto our suggestion . . . they      even closed down the single small demonstration farm they      did have! So Bob Rowe and I "broke ranks" and started our      own organization. Friends of the Farm was chartered in      Dalton City, Illinois in December 1979 . . . for the      purpose of spreading knowledge and instructing people in      the techniques of growing food without chemicals. We now      have about 25 practicing organic farms in the United      States-mostly in the Midwest-which are all open      to the public. We plan to form chapters in every state      eventually, so that people can get together and exchange      ideas and know-how.    </p>    <p>      Friends of the Farm would <em>also</em> like to set up some      sort of information bank, using a computer to store      agricultural information. Any organic grower who had a      question could call the computer on a special WATS line and      get an answer. Let's say, for example, that you live down      in Hendersonville, North Carolina and have a problem with      peach leaf curl . . . but all the agricultural "experts" in      your area recommend only various chemical pesticides.      Instead of following their advice, you could call Friends      of the Farm and say, "I'm having trouble with peach leaf      curl. How should I treat it?" And the computer would tell      you, "Well, you do this and this, and here are your      references." What a wonderful tool it could be!    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Besides drawing on the collective      experience of local and national organizations such as FOF,      what else can a beginning farmer do to learn the basics of      growing foods naturally? Do you have any words of wisdom      for-specifically-the organic fruit grower who's      just getting started?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> I would recommend that the      aspiring farmer first contact an available expert in the      field . . . someone like Dr. Peter Escher, who studied with      Dr. Pfeiffer at the Threefold Farm in New York. This      "authority" should be brought in to evaluate the      orchardist's whole setupthe location, the soil type, the      drainage, and the climate-and make some      recommendations for soil preparation, tree spacing, and so      forth.    </p>    <p>      Next, the fledgling orchard-keeper should attend      conferences and meetings of groups like Friends of the Farm      and the National Health Federation . . . not only to pick      up practical tips, but to make him- or herself known in      such circles.    </p>    <p>      Beyond mastering the <em>technical</em> details of growing      organic produce, the orchardist has got to make every      effort to become familiar with the <em>market</em> . . .      which, as I mentioned, today consists mainly of health food      stores and co-op groups. But you have to make yourself and      your product <em>known</em> , because only when you inspire      people's confidence will your business thrive. It's      necessary to get out and <em>talk</em> to folks, to explain      the dangers of chemically treated produce, and to tell them      how you grow things. We need the sort of personal rapport      between food producers and consumers that we <em>used</em>      to have and that now exists in China . . . where the person      in the city knows who grew the food he or she is eating,      and considers their relationship to be an important one.    </p>    <p>      After you've gotten started, you also have to find a market      for <em>as much of your produce as possible,</em> whether      it's of top quality in appearance or not. If you're going      to keep the price of your first-grade fruits or vegetables      at a realistic level, you <em>have</em> to find a use for      the culls. A young business, you see, simply can't afford      the cost of throwing out a large part of the harvest every      year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Why is it so important to you to      get other people involved in chemical-free farming?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Well, I think that we're now      living in a period when North American agricultural      technology has gone wild and has no central direction.      We're traveling on a collision course with catastrophe,      thanks to our heavy use of herbicides and other toxic      chemicals. I've heard it said that there are only three      years of production left in the Great Plains-that      once fertile breadbasket-simply because chemicals      have burned away the topsoil.    </p>    <p>      We've been, in effect, drawing on our bank      account-taking out of the soil without putting      anything of value back in-for years, and it's      beginning to catch up with us now. Agribusiness has become      a real problem . . . so the sooner we can teach people the      techniques involved in wholistic agriculture, the better.      Such methods could help prevent severe shortages and      starvation in the future, and <em>might</em> even allow us      to repair some of the damage that's been done to our      precious soil.    </p>    <p>      On a more personal scale, I think organic farming is      important because it gives us good nutritious food. It's      really true that we are what we eat . . . and it's vital to      our survival that we consume pure, unpolluted nourishment.      I don't think the human body was intended to get sick and      break down all the time. I think it's supposed to live out      its genetic potential . . . and it <em>can</em> , if we      just take care of it and give it the right foods.    </p>    <p>      However, I don't want to be seen as a prophet of doom and      gloom. I can really envision a <em>bright future</em> . I      foresee small communities, with gardens on the periphery      where people can grow their own food. I see photovoltaic      cells charging the batteries for tractors and other      machinery that would be needed to cultivate those plots.      It's all possible . . . if we can just convince enough      people of the <em>importance</em> of developing renewable      sources of energy and applying the principles of organic      farming.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> What role do you hope to play in      bringing about the social transformation that you've      described?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> I want to devote the rest of my      life to furthering the cause of wholistic agriculture. I'm      71 years old now, and I've learned a lot of things in my      time. I just want to teach people what I know, and inspire      them to try new ideas themselves.    </p>    <p>      I also want to be able to tell people that, if they plan to      go into this business, they shouldn't do so just to make      money: They should also have a desire to help other folks      and to purify the environment.    </p>    <p>      The specific thing that motivates me, I guess, is a      still-growing aversion to the poisons that are commonly      used on large farms. I remember that many years ago, when I      had just come back from the service and moved out to this      farm, I bought 25 little chicks to raise. They were out on      the back porch one afternoon, and because the flies seemed      particularly bad, I sprayed the area with a can of DDT.      Folks had no idea-in those days-of the dangers      of that potent poison. Well, within 15 minutes after I had      sprayed, every one of those little chickens was on its back      with its legs quivering in a final spasm!    </p>    <p>      I simply feel that <em>all</em> concerned people      <em>have</em> to work to present the case for organic      growing to the public, because the government often      <em>recommends</em> agricultural chemicals for use . . .      and even does so without thoroughly assessing the      long-range effects of the substances on the human body! For      example, the USDA claimed, for along time, that Captan was      one of the <em>safest</em> fungicides available, and that      it had a very low L.D.-that's lethal      dosage-rating. Well, I recently read that Captan is      being taken off the market because it's been found to      belong to the thalidomide family and could be a possible      cause of birth defects!    </p>    <p>      You know, not long ago a gentleman from one of the big      chemical companies came knocking at my door and said, "I'm      Dr. So-and-so, and I'd just like to know why in the world      you go to all the trouble necessary to raise your apples      naturally when it would be so much simpler to follow      <em>our</em> recommendations and get just as good yields      <em>and</em> make just as much money." And I told him,      "Well, I want to have the comfort of knowing that if some      little child picks up one of my apples and eats it without      washing it first, he or she won't be in danger of being      poisoned."    </p>    <p>      We should try, though, not to be <em>too</em> harsh in our      dealings with those who practice chemical farming. Instead,      we ought to attempt to understand the problems that many      commercial growers have, and show them-by      example-that it is possible to be successful,      <em>and</em> to grow delicious and wholesome food,      <em>without</em> using poisons. I guess I've mellowed in my      old age . . . I can't <em>condone</em> the things that many      agribusiness farms do, but I <em>can</em> applaud when they      use even <em>one</em> less chemical. At least that's a step      in the right direction.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLOWBOY:</strong> Do you think that enough farmers      will take enough such steps?    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOMSON:</strong> Yes, I firmly believe that our      civilization will make the necessary decisions: It has to.      I have a little theory I call Thomson's Law of Concentric      Circles, which is modeled after the wave rings a rock makes      when it's thrown into a still pond. If other stones are      thrown into the pool, <em>more</em> circles will develop .      . . and the expanding rings will begin to overlap, until      they completely cover the surface in interlocking patterns.      That's what will happen, I think, with organic farming.      More and more groups of concerned people are already      sending out circles of influence, and those initial rings      will connect with <em>other</em> circles, other groups . .      . until someday the message will cover the whole pond!    </p>    <p>      But it all begins with those first few circles reaching out      across the surface of the water . . . the concerned      individual farmer working on his or her land. And that      should be everyone's first priority: to use a piece of      ground-even if it's no more than a tiny backyard      garden or an apartment window box-to grow at least      <em>some</em> of his or her food <em>without</em> using      poisonous chemicals. It isn't <em>difficult</em> to do so .      . . all it requires is commitment. In fact, I think the      essence of wholistic agriculture was well-summarized by old      Confucius, who said that the best fertilizer on any farm is      the footsteps of the farmer.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to learn more about the basics      of natural farming or would like to visit an operative      organic farm, write to Friends of the Farm, Dept.
