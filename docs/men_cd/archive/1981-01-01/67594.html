                <p>      The future of our civilization may well be tied to that of      our independently owned, agricultural enterprises.      Therefore, it should be a mattered of concern to everyone      that there's...    </p>						<h5 id="byline">      By Peter Hemingson    </h5>        <p>      American agriculture is in a state of crisis, and the      future of the family farm-an institution often      considered to be a cornerstone of our society-looks      grim.    </p>    <p>      The signs of trouble are everywhere . . . in the protest      parades of tractors, in the strange combination of high      food prices and low farm income, and in the declining      number of working agricultural operations. As a matter of      fact, while there were 6.8 million U.S. farms in 1935, the      total had dropped to 2.3 million by 1974. . . and      <em>that</em> figure is expected to decline to 1.5 million      by the <em>end of</em> <em>this year</em> !    </p>    <p>      Of course, the powers that be in American agriculture have      ways of explaining away even such shocking evidence. It is      often claimed, for instance, that the statistics just      reflect the weeding out of small, inefficient enterprises .      . . and we're constantly told that our farms are producing      <em>more</em> <em>than ever before</em> .    </p>    <p>      Aren't we, then, just seeing the "economics of size" at      work in rural America? Well, maybe. The number of small      "noncommercial" farms-defined by the USDA as those      with sales of less than $2,500 a year-declined from      2,388,000 in 1949 to just 771,000 in 1974. During the same      period, the quantity of small "commercial"      farms-operations with sales of between $2,500 and      $40,000-shrank, too . . . from 2,893,000 to      1,218,000. Only the <em>large</em> commercial      farms-those with sales of over      $40,000-increased ... from 104,000 in 1949 to 477,000      i n 1974.    </p>    <p>      Among the big farms, the very <em>largest</em> -with      sales of over $200,000-multiplied most rapidly ...      from 16,000 to 63,000! And the large agricultural concerns      didn't grow just in <em>number . . . they</em> increased in      size, too: The average U.S. farm in 1940 covered 197 acres,      but by 1974 the average had grown to 440 acres.    </p>    <p>      All in all, it appears that the American farmer has been      following the "get big or get out" advice of former      Secretary of Agriculture Earl Butz. And economies of scale      do seem-at least on the face of the matter-to      make good sense. However, the USDA has discovered that the      "bigger is more efficient" argument isn't all it's cracked      up to be. In fact, Department of Agriculture economist      Thomas Miller has reported that medium-sized farms (with      gross sales from $20,000 to $100,000) are most efficient!      Above the $20,000 threshold, says Miller, there are no      important reductions in the unit cost of production. So      farms grow beyond medium size not because it's less      expensive to produce each bushel of wheat when you're one      of the "big boys" . . . but simply because the overgrown      acreages can produce-and sell-more bushels of      wheat.    </p>    <p>      Now a grower's desire to raise more wheat-or corn, or      oats, or soybeans-is understandable, but the course      of action that must be taken to do so does have several      hidden consequences. For one thing, large-scale      farmers-with good access to credit-often      <em>bid</em> up the price of available land ... and the      result is that small growers cannot afford to buy or lease      additional acreage.    </p>    <p>      Worse yet, as the sales value of the land in an area rises,      taxes follow suit . . . again putting economic stress on      the family farmer. Furthermore, the problems are aggravated      because-according to a recent USDA      study-federal and state tax laws give special tax      benefits to <em>high-income</em> farmland buyers ... and      such laws have created incentives for farmers to shift      their attention from efficiency and productivity to farm      <em>expansion, and</em> to the appreciation of land values      as an <em>end in</em> itself.    </p>    <p>      Even the federal commodity programs-supposedly      designed to help growers when crop prices are depressed      -accelerate the trend toward fewer, but      <em>larger,</em> farms. A USDA report indicates that most      price supports don't differentiate between family      farms-the natural target of such aid-and      corporate farms . . . and thus the programs provide the      largest amount of assistance to the giant enterprises that      produce the most.    </p>    <p>      And-in a self-perpetuating cycle-the corporate      farmers often apply that "bonus" money to underwrite even      further expansion! What's more, income support and disaster      payment-as well as commodity-programs tend to      encourage the large-scale, single-purpose farms ... often      operations that are bankrolled by nonfarm investors, who      use highly leveraged debt financing.    </p>    <p>      As you can imagine, such economic factors often force      smaller-scale farmers either to expand, abandon production,      or become part-time growers . . . and the last two      choices-given the limited capital of most family      operations-are the ones frequently taken. Well, you      might ask, why not? Why <em>shouldn't the</em> most      efficient and best-capitalized farmers drive the      inefficient little guys out of business?    </p>    <p>      Aside from the ethics of the situation, the best answer to      such questions is simply that our present system isn't      <em>working.</em> The fact is that much of America's fabled      agricultural productivity is based on large chemical- and      energy-intensive monoculture (single-crop) operations.      And-as we approach the end of the century-it's going      to become more and more difficult, <em>and expensive,</em>      to maintain the kinds of farms that we've come to depend      upon.    </p>    <p>      In the USDA's, "Report and Recommendations on Organic      Farming" [EDITOR'S NOTE: See page 175 of MOTHER NO.      66-available for $3.00 plus $1.00 shipping and      handling from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791-for a brief      summary of this study] <em>,</em> deep concern is expressed      about the probable future repercussions of such practices      as intensive and continuous production of cash grains, and      extensive and often <em>excessive</em> use of chemicals.      The report team cites especially the danger of sharply      increasing costs (and uncertain availability) of energy and      of chemical fertilizers . . . the steady decline in soil      productivity and tilth resulting from excessive erosion and      loss of soil organic matter . . . and the problems      resulting from the pollution of natural waters by      agricultural chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the cost of agricultural land is often so      high that many farmers feel <em>compelled</em> to extract      every last bushel from their acreage .. . and that fact      encourages practices that destroy the land. As author Mark      Kramer points out, "When short-term demand makes the      squander ing of resources profitable, resources are      squandered. Farmers farm as their situations dictate." [      EDITOR'S NOTE: Kramer's book Three Farms: Making Milk, Meat      and Money from the American Soil (Little, Brown, 1980,      $11.95) takes a thoughtful look at our agricultural      difficulties.]    </p>    <p>      The problem, in short, is that we're putting <em>all</em>      of our agricultural eggs in one large money-, chemical-,      and energy-intensive basket .. . and, in the process, we're      allowing our backup systems-the family farms-to      be swallowed up or abandoned.    </p>    <p>      When the last drop of oil is extracted from the ground, we      may welt not be able (even if there were a rational reason      for doing so) to ship a carrot 2,500 miles from producer to      consumer. We've encouraged big agriculture (both farmers      <em>and market</em> ers) in the name of a search for      inexpensive food . . . but food is no longer inexpensive.      And the average family farm has not seen its income grow .      . . despite the higher cost to consumers of its goods.    </p>    <p>      <em>That's</em> why there have been tractor parades at the      Capitol, and <em>that's</em> why we need to be concerned      about the future of the family farm.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> There is some occasion for      optimism, in spite of our current <em>agricultural dilemma.      Notably, the Family Farm Development Act of 1980, as      proposed by Representatives Richard Nolan of Minnesota and      George Brown of California, could aid the small-scale      grower.</em> <em>I</em> <em>nformation on the bill is      available from the offices of the two congressmen, or from      the National Family Farm Coalition, Dept. TMEN, 918 F      Street N. W., 2nd Floor, Washington, D .C. 20004. Another      encouraging sign is the positive attention that</em>      <em>the USDA has been paying to organic agriculture. And      perhaps most important of all is the fact that private      parties are beginning to address the problems facing the      family farm: One example is described in the sidebar      below.</em>    </p>    <p>      Our future doesn't have to be dismal, and a group that's      pointing the way for family farms-and providing a model      that shows how pleasant and productive the years to come      can be-is responsible for . . .    </p>		<h2 id="subtitle">Shelburne Farms: The Greening of a White Elephant</h2>        <p>      Shelburne Farms-which occupies some 1,700 rolling      acres on the Vermont shore of Lake Champlain-is      hardly a <em>typical</em> family farm operation ... even      though it <em>has</em> been owned by the same family for      nearly 100 years. Shelburne began, you see, as a rich man's      agricultural estate ... an experimental farm put together      by a person with enough time, money, and drive to seek      agricultural perfection.    </p>    <p>      The land-use design for the property was done by Frederick      Law Olmstead, the architect of New York's Central Park . .      . and owner William Seward Webb planted forests, raised      livestock, grew field crops, and installed orchards. The      enterprise flourished. By 1890, Shelburne Farms harvested      rye, oats, and wheat . . . sold butter, milk, eggs, and      apples to the New York markets . . . and had under      construction greenhouses, dairy barns, and sheep and      poultry pens.    </p>    <p>      Over the course of the next 70 years, Shelburne Farms      always paid its own way . . . the small profit turned in      during some years served to cancel out the minor losses      incurred in others. By the 1960's, however, the      agricultural estate began to look like a "white elephant"      property. Taxes had risen and were continuing to rise, and      the expansion of the nearby city of Burlington was rapidly      driving up the price of land . . . which added to the tax      burden.    </p>    <p>      When Shelburne's annual tax bill climbed to $50,000, Derick      Webb-the farm's present owner-called a family      meeting. He explained the economics of the situation . . .      and then asked his children what they wanted to do with      their inheritance. Unanimously, they chose to resist the      easy money that could be had by developing the property for      homesites. The family members all felt that their historic      homestead was too valuable an agricultural, historic,      <em>and</em> environmental resource to sell off piecemeal.    </p>    <p>      So in 1972-with money provided by the sale of an      adjacent piece of land to the Nature Conservancy-      ''Shelburne Farms Resources" was organized as a non-profit      educational corporation. The goal of SFR is to develop an      <em>integrated</em> use of the farm's assets . . .      employing the property to teach land management techniques,      to experiment with new crops for the Northeast, and to      apply primarily wholistic methods to relatively large-scale      farming. The Webb family believed that Shelburne Farms      could function as a magnet, attracting      attention-because of its history, its architectural      excellence, and its beauty-to innovative farm ideas.    </p>    <p>      The development of creative forms of crop marketing has      also been im portant to Shelburne Farms. Several members of      the Webb family helped to organize Vermont's first modern      farmers' market, so that growers would have a local outlet      for their goods. And, in an even more innovative move, the      owners leased spacein the huge central structure known to      everyone as the Farm Barn-to small enterprises that      would use Shelburne products. These include a bakery      (getting its flour from farm-grown wheat), a weaving shop      (obtaining wool from the farm's sheep), and a cabinetmaker      (working with wood from the estate's forest).    </p>    <p>      In a sense, Shelburne is <em>reinventing</em> the village      for the post-hydrocarbon society that may well be a part of      our future. There are even plans afoot to create a small      group of homes on the farm, for folks who draw their living      from the acreage!    </p>    <p>      Shelburne Farms hasn't overlooked <em>agricultural</em>      innovation, either. The SFR has established a test plot of      some 1.500 black walnut trees. representing 60 different      varieties. The farm's organization-in cooperation      with the University of Vermont-is examining the      potential of this dual-purpose silviculture, in which an      annual cash crop of nuts helps to pay costs while the trees      grow to marketable timber size.    </p>    <p>      Fields of barley have been planted in an attempt to      discover whether that grain can be grown for feed in New      England as an alternative to corn. (Barley produces a lower      yield than corn, but requires much less energy to grow.)      And, for fertilizer, Shelburne-again, with the      cooperation of the University of Vermont-is testing      the use of sewage sludge. Furthermore, the farm boasts the      state's <em>only</em> raw-milk dairy . . . and will soon      begin to generate methane from the cow manure produced by      that operation.    </p>    <p>      Shelburne Farms is, then, an experiment in      "re-regionalizing" . . . in developing appropriate methods      of responding to some of the problems facing America's      family farms. By shifting their focus from a national      market to a regional and local one, the Webbs have been      able to revive some locally neglected techniques (such as      the farmers' market) <em>and</em> to introduce new crops to      what had become Vermont's milk monoculture. As teaching and      example-setting operations like Shelburne Farms spring up      across the country-and MOTHER firmly hopes and      believes that they will-the family farm may find a      new lease on life in America!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: As a final step in saving Shelburne Farms,      SFR is about to acquire-at half price-the      ownership of the farm's land from the Webb family.
