                <p>      In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of mankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied... and announced our      stillstanding offer: Anyone (and that means <em>you</em> !)      who sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an      actual barter that's good enough to print will      receive-as the folks on the following page      have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of      same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>        <p>      The <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), Inc. P.O. Box 70      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791    </p>    <p>      My wife Viola, our three-year-old Damian, and I have been      dining on a delicious harvest of chickens this winter,      thanks to a convenient trade we made last autumn. This is      how our "fowl feast" deal came about:    </p>    <p>      I'm a mechanic of sorts, you see, and had recently      completed repairs on a rundown rototiller. But before      giving the clodbuster a clean bill of health, I wanted to      take it for a spin . . . to be sure that the "cure" had      worked. And since <em>my</em> garden was already sprouting      a fall cover crop, I was searching for some <em>"not</em> -      so-green pastures" to till.    </p>    <p>      While I was visiting my neighbors one evening, the folks      happened to mention that they were thinking of selling 35      egg layers who were past their prime . . . and, in the      course of the conversation, I discovered that the couple      had a frostbitten garden that needed to be turned under      before the winter weather arrived in full force.    </p>    <p>      Well-aside from the fact that I'd been looking for a      bare garden plot to till-I have a pretty strong bent      toward barter (and am mighty fond of a tasty hen decorating      my dinner plate now and again) . . . so I offered to test      the sodscrambling machine on my friends' soil, in exchange      for a number of their cluckers    </p>    <p>      Now my neighbors have a garden that's just waiting for the      first daffodil to poke its head through the snow, and we      have a freezer packed full of featherless fowl!    </p>    <p>      D.M.<br />      Iowa    </p>    <p>      I own a small woodworking and instrument repair shop, and      the onslaught of winter found my establishment still      unheated. Not particularly wanting to lose fingers or ruin      a partially completed musicmaker through cold-induced      clumsiness, I began searching for some practical means of      warming the place up a bit.    </p>    <p>      At first I ran the gamut of available electric heaters, but      <em>besides</em> the fact that none of the watt-wasters was      adequate to warm the shop, I found myself feeling guilty      about consuming so much energy so inefficiently (not to      mention that my electric bill was beginning to increase      faster than the rate of inflation!).    </p>    <p>      I was still mulling over my heating problem one blustery      winter afternoon, when a friend showed up at the workshop      and admired a banjo I was building. It turned out that he      was hankering after just such an instrument . . . and      before long the musician proposed a trade involving my new      banjo and his antique stove! Well, in practically no time      at all, I had a warm shop in which to work and-more      important-was discovering the many pleasures of wood      heat.    </p>    <p>      Since then the timber-burner has been moved into my house,      where it is a continuing source of cheer, and I've even      <em>built</em> several stoves (like the heater in MOTHER      NO. 48) . . . one for the shop, another to warm the water      in my hot tub, and a third that I traded to a friend.    </p>    <p>      I guess it just goes to show that you can find eager      swappers even down here in the Sunshine State!    </p>    <p>      R.L.<br />      Florida    </p>    <p>      This morning, as I opened my last quart of homemade maple      syrup, I was reminded of the many items the sweetener      "bought" me-through barter-over the past year.    </p>    <p>      I was bitten by the "sugaring bug" for the first time the      fall before last, and immediately began trying to locate      some tappin' trees. Well, it just so happened that my      neighbor had a beautiful grove of sugar maples nestled      along his creek . . and although he admitted that he'd      <em>like</em> to be able to feast occasionally on a      plateful of flapjacks drowned in a sea of syrup, my      nextfarm friend couldn't be persuaded to spend <em>his</em>      crisp winter days toiling over a vat of bubbling sap.    </p>    <p>      So we struck up a bargain: I would tap the trees of my      choice (and use all the dead wood I needed to stoke up the      sugaring fires) . . . and my friend would get half of      whatever syrup I coaxed from his maples.    </p>    <p>      Well, by the time the spring flowers began to parade their      petals around our farm, my share amounted to four      <em>gallons</em> of the lip-smackin' sweetener. And that      was just the <em>beginning</em> of my trading spree!    </p>    <p>      When my garden soil needed a boost of organic fertilizer, I      swapped some syrup for a spreader load of manure from a      local dairy farmer. Then, later in the summer-when      the vigorous vegetables had occupied every available      cultivated corner and were camped out all over my kitchen      counter as well-it seemed that I had gotten the best      part of the deal . . . so I gave the dairyman a couple of      bushels of sweet corn to even out the bargain.    </p>    <p>      Now, as I settle back after a delicious breakfast of      steaming hotcakes and (of course) syrup, I'm glad that sap      season is just around the corner . . . because I'm sure      looking forward to another year of good eating <em>and</em>      good swapping!    </p>    <p>      S.C.<br />      Wisconsin    </p>    <p>      Swapping is so much a part of our lifestyle here in Tucson,      Arizona that it's <em>impossible</em> to keep track of our      bartering deals! Just a sampling of some recent swaps      includes trading "dough babies" (the idea came from MOTHER      NO. 48) for hand-dipped candles . . . exchanging two      embroidered pillowcases for a collection of African      butterflies . . . and receiving a bolt of elegant      handpainted fabric, and a load of beautiful oak lumber      (which we used to build our children's beds), in return for      some of our silver artwork and jewelry.    </p>    <p>      We swap for the "essentials", too. For example, I      "purchase" my pick of fashionable garments without money .      . . by working part time in a friend's vintage clothing      shop. (And with the high prices that are normally charged      for women's wear these days, my deal saves us <em>a      lot</em> of cash!)    </p>    <p>      Another advantageous exchange-one which is necessary      to our simplified lifestyle-involves my writing the      monthly newsletter for my daughter's alternative school.      Believe me, trading off part of the tuition sure helps our      limited budget stay out of the red!    </p>    <p>      And, now that money is becoming even <em>scarcer</em> (and      it looks like the economy won't be budging from its low      condition in the months to come), I'm swapping every chance      I get. So how about it, MOM . . . this story for a      subscription?    </p>    <p>      V.S.<br />      Arizona    </p>    <p>      I've known-for some time now-that I could swap      for <em>expensive</em> items (which I wouldn't be able to      afford any other way), but MOTHER recently motivated me to      make bartering a regular habit. To date, I've exchanged my      goods or services for a Kohler generator, boat storage,      fire wood, and even for food. And it's not just the      <em>practical</em> aspect of bartering that appeals to me,      either . . . I'm hooked into the ethics of it as well! I      prefer swapping for items rather than accepting "free      bies", and it also seems that trading pro vides a more      genuine transaction than just forking out the almighty      dollar for merchandise.    </p>    <p>      But I was <em>especially</em> happy to discover that      bartering can help me professionally, too! As a college      instructor teaching "human communication", I often      supplement my not-very-large paycheck by consulting for      private business firms. Unfortunately,      however-although I <em>do</em> provide a much-needed      service-many potential clients are scared off by the      cost. So, when my dentist suggested that we swap his      tooth-tinkering skills (to cap my chompers) for my      communications evaluation of his staff, I <em>jumped</em>      at the chance to do some serious trading. I simply studied      the office interaction while having the dental work      performed . . . and-after the first successful      consultation session-the doctor even wondered whether      he'd done <em>enough</em> on his end of the deal!    </p>    <p>      What a great way to do business! In fact, from now on, I      aim to operate my consulting firm on a barter basis as      often as possible!    </p>    <p>      C. M. S.<br />      Washington    </p>
