                <p>      <strong>The Seasons of the Garden</strong>    </p>    <p>      Chill winter rules the slumbering garden, and-in many      parts of the country-the soil snuggles beneath thick      blankets of snow. Dull whites, grays, and browns mark the      triumph of the cold dominion . . . but inside homes across      the land -by the warm glow of blazing fires-the      pages of seed catalogs fill imaginations with vernal      fantasies of color and fragrance.    </p>            <p>      One of the real pleasures of gardening is planting some of      the "new and improved, best ever, grows taller (or smaller)      and bears over a longer period (or all at once)" varieties      that are featured in the seed catalogs each year. We have      been receiving advance notice of some of the newcomers . .      . so here-for your planning and planting      pleasure-are the introductions for 1981 !    </p>    <p>      Burpee is offering five new vegetable and fruit varieties      for the forthcoming season. <em>Green Goliath Broccoli</em>      matures over a <em>three-week peri</em> od, and sets side      shoots after the center heads have been harvested.    </p>    <p>      The <em>Streamliner</em> <em>Hybrid Cucumber</em> is a      compact plant that sets ten-inch fruit in unusual quantity      ... thanks chiefly to the fact that all the blossoms are      female. (Of course, a plant or two of a pollinating variety      must be grown <em>with</em> the hybrid . . . but Burpee      includes such seeds in each packet.) Streamliner Is mosaic      and mildew resistant, and should be a real hit with      wholistic gardeners.    </p>    <p>      Honeydew melon fans will want to try the <em>Venus</em>      <em>Hybrid Muskmelon</em> <em>, a</em> short-season      (88-day) delicacy with bright green flesh that has all the      sweetness and aroma of a honeydew. And-because Venus      slips easily from the vine when it's ready for      picking-there's never any question as to whether the      succulent melons are ripe.    </p>    <p>      Finally, Burpee has come up with a worthy successor to its      famous Big Early tomato. Look for <em>Early Pick</em>      <em>Hybrid</em> VF, which adds disease resistance and      higher yield to the outstanding flavor of Big Early. The      fruit of this husky indeterminate plant will begin to ripen      in about 62 days.    </p>    <p>      Our good friends to the north, at Vesey Seeds, are offering      four new varieties this year. <em>Gold</em> <em>Rush      Bush</em> <em>Beans</em> mature large clusters of long,      straight, golden pods in 54 days . . . and the treats will      <em>remain</em> on the plant, in prime condition, for a      <em>very</em> long time.    </p>    <p>      <em>Raider Hybrid Cucumber</em> is another gynoecious (or      allfemale) variety. The compact vines are tolerant to      mosaic and resistant to scab.    </p>    <p>      <em>Harmony Hybrid</em> is Vesey's entry in the bicolor      corn contest. The closely packed ears mature in 73 days.    </p>    <p>      <em>Big Set</em> <em>Hybrid</em> tomatoes are perfect for      the short Canadian season: They're extra early, but produce      exceptionally large fruit!    </p>    <p>      Gurney's got a new "girl" this year, and she looks like a      sure winner. Eight years ago the company set out to find a      tomato that had real old-time flavor . . . and the folks      from South Dakota have hit the jackpot! Their indeterminate      variety <em>Gurney Girl</em> combines a tangy, delicious      taste with high yield, great vigor, and an impressive      degree of disease resistance: The plants are unaffected by      tobacco mosaic, two types of <em>Fusarium,      Verticillium</em> , and nematodes. Too often, disease      resistance is won at the <em>expense</em> of flavor . . .      so Gurney Girl appears to be a real triumph!    </p>    <p>      Summer squash plants are frequently infected with mosaic      virus, and the result is often an unattractive green      mottling on the fruit. Harris Seeds is introducing      <em>Multipik Hybrid, a</em> beautiful buttery yellow squash      which doesn't show the effects of mosaic mottling. It's      early and prolific, too.    </p>    <p>      Harris is also offering <em>Superstar</em> <em>Hybrid      Muskmelon</em> <em>, a</em> big (6- to 8-pound), delicious,      productive fruit that holds its sweetness for up to a week      after picking.    </p>    <p>      Park Seeds has developed a new multipurpose squash called      the Kuta <em>Hybrid.</em> Its young fruit can be eaten raw      or cooked, while the mature squash can be stuffed or baked.    </p>    <p>      <em>Butterfruit</em> is the new "supersweet" corn      introduction from Park. The kernels are twice as sweet as      ordinary corn, and the flavor lasts for days under      refrigeration.    </p>    <p>      (Watermelon thumpers will want to try Park's      <em>Bushbaby</em> ... a compact and vigorous improvement      over previous bush melons.)    </p>    <p>      Epicure Seeds has combed the world's seed catalogs again,      and come up with 26 new offerings for this year! You'll      find pesto basil and red chicories from Italy, wild fennel      from Sicily, dwarf cauliflower from Australia, an intensely      aromatic parsley from Belgium, <em>feldsalat (or</em> corn      salad) from Germany, and a disease-resistant      Charentais-type melon from France!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: To order the (usually free) catalogs offered      by the firms mentioned above, see MOM's 1981 guide to the      seed company "wish books" on page 46.    </p>		<hr />    <h2 id="subtitle">      Spicy Book    </h2>    <p>      Hard on the heels of <em>Park's Success With Seeds</em>      comes yet <em>another</em> important gardening volume from      America's largest family-owned seed company. It is called      <em>Park's Success With Herbs,</em> a 192-page volume by      Connecticut herbalists Gertrude B. Foster and Rosemary F.      Louden . . . and-forgive the punit's a dilly! This volume      furnishes information on how to grow, pick, use, and      preserve 100 different herbs . . . includes 350 color      photographs of both seedlings <em>and</em> mature plants .      . . supplies recipes for many of the unusual varieties      listed . . . and crossindexes both common and Latin names.    </p>    <p>      Most people realize that herbs can be <em>dried</em> for      off-season use, but Foster and Louden give detailed      instructions for <em>freezing</em> many of the savory      plants. Chervil, for example, loses its delicate flavor      when dried . . . but retains its taste if it's spun in a      blender-with water-and then frozen in ice cube      trays. Basil, chives, coriander, dill, fennel, lovage,      mint, sorrel, lemon balm, and sweet cicely-according      to the authors-will <em>all</em> benefit from      deep-freeze storage.    </p>    <p>      For <em>beginning</em> herbalists, the book provides a plan      for a 9' X 15' garden that will hold more than 150 plants,      . . . representing 25 species. You'll find information on      <em>interplanting</em> herbs with other vegetable crops,      too . . . and a discussion of the role of the aromatic      greenery as an insect repellent. <em>Park's Success With      Herbs</em> is worthy of a place on any gardener's      bookshelf. To order, send $9.95 to <em>Park's Success With      Herbs,</em> George W. Park Seed Co., Dept. TMEN, Box 31,      Greenwood, South Carolina 29847.    </p>
