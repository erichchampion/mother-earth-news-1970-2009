                    <p>      <strong>The <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you now operate, or have <em>ever</em> operated, a      successful home business that was inspired by an article      you read in MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or less) when and      where-and with how much "seed money"-you started your      venture. Because ii your story can be fitted into an      upcoming installment of BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll      receive [1] the warm satisfaction of knowing that you      helped someone else find the happiness you enjoy and [2] a      free two-year new or renewal subscription to THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS    </p>    <p>      Three years ago I was faced with the need to supplement my      income when-at age 48-my total earnings were      suddenly cut to $300 a month. I wanted to work at home and,      if possible, put my artistic talents to use . . . so I      began to scan MOTHER's Bootstrap Businesses feature. Two      letters in particular-Lisa Laursen's story in issue      51 (page 131) and Louise Drouin's write-up in issue 62      (page 150)-captured my attention. Lisa and Louise had      each managed to establish a thriving sewing enterprise, and      reading about <em>their</em> good fortune shifted my      imagination Into high gear.    </p>    <p>      Although I'm not an <em>expert</em> stitcher, I figured      that-with my drawing ability-I could comer the      market in pattern designs . . . and that was the beginning      of "Du-Hickles Patterns by Mail". I knew there were plenty      of commercial clothing designs already widely available...      but toy pattems, l felt, would be something of a novelty.    </p>    <p>      I began by creating a number of blueprints for      <em>small</em> figures-which I priced at $1.00 per      set-as well as designs for larger dolls, animals, and      assorted creatures ranging in cost from 50 cents to $1.50      each. (For a list of available patterns, please send a      self-addressed, stamped envelope with your request.) Then I      invested $100 in paper, ink, envelopes, and a classified ad      in a crafts magazine ... dragged out an old mimeograph      machine that I'd had stored away for years . . . and before      long found myself earning an average of $200 a month. (I've      since had a steady 150% increase in business each year.)    </p>    <p>      Still-despite my success in the pattern trade-I      was itching to make use of my ink drawings. Consequently, I      drew some sketches of birds and sent them off to be printed      on attractive (but inexpensive) notepaper . . . and I now      carry mail order stationery-which sells in packages      of 12 notes and envelopes for $2.00 a packet,      postpaid-in addition to my toy designs. Moreover, my      business ventures didn't end with number two. As soon as I      caught a glimpse of the story of A. Rosan's newsletter      success (on page 152 of issue 61), I set about putting      together a bulletin for bird fanciers. And-though      that publication is still largely in the planning      stages-I expect to complete its first edition within      the next year.    </p>    <p>      I've lived by the words of opera singer Beverly Sills, who      states that every 50-year-old woman should have an exciting      new beginning: I am now 51, and-thanks to THE MOTHER      EARTH NEWS(restricted)-I'm on the threshold of my third      fresh start!    </p>    <p>      Helen M. Fairfield-Hickey<br />      Dept. TMEN<br />      36 Upper Bartlett Rd.<br />      Quaker Hill, Conn. 06375    </p>    <p>      When my husband Alex and I bought our first Belgian mare,      we promptly contracted an Incurable case of "draft      horse-itis". We discovered that "animal power" is both      economical and environmentally safe-since the beasts      run on homegrown "fuel", supply organic fertilizer, and      give birth to their own replacements-and before long      the two of us became active members of the North Idaho      Draft Horse Association. Soon we were helping to organize      draft horse shows ... <em>and</em> beginning to be      considered all-round experts in the field.    </p>    <p>      People quickly became accustomed to approaching us with      requests for information about repair shops, suppliers, and      the like... and Alex and I found ourselves routinely      telling folks where they could go to find wheelwrights,      harnesses, plows, and breeders. Then one day we happened      upon "Small-Time Operator" on page 72 of MOTHER NO. 47 ...      an article that started us thinking that we could pass on      our knowledge, for a profit, by putting together a draft      horse directory.    </p>    <p>      I wrote to a number of magazines to investigate their      advertising rates and, at the following association      meeting, Alex and I handed out typed, photocopied      information sheets presenting the idea for our guide and      stating our rates for listings and display advertisements.      Shortly thereafter, we received our first 112-page ad,      along with a payment of $100. With that money, we ordered      stationery and envelopes and had our directory's logo drawn      up. In addition, we put a deposit on the book's printing      stock, and had our info sheets professionally typeset and      printed to send out to potential advertisers. Then we      placed an ad in one of our favorite draft horse      magazines-in hopes that it would bring in enough cash      to cover our printing expenses-and soon the dollars      started rolling in.    </p>    <p>      Our first issue of <em>The Reach</em> boasted more than 125      advertisers ... and though-at the time of this      writing-we are still paying the printing costs, we      calculate that we'll have earned a small profit by the end      of 1980. The directory is scheduled to come out in annual      editions . . . with the second issue-which will sell      for $3.00 per copy, postpaid in the U.S. and      Canada-slated for January 1981. Alex and I hope that      our guidebook will serve as a link between both new and      long-established businesses and the people who are looking      for them . . . rather like the reach on a wagon, connecting      the two sets of wheels: buyer and seller!    </p>    <p>      Kayo Fraser<br />      <em>The Reach</em><br />      Dept. M<br />      HCR 66, Box 924<br />      Sagle, Idaho 83860    </p>    <p>      Since I had a paper route for a number of years, and      accumulated an abundance of "extra" newsprint, I've tried      just about every possible way to roll newspapers into      firelogs. My handiwork had-until recently-never      been too successful, because the ignited "logs" would      Invariably smolder and fume up the place with an awful      smell. But when I read MOTHER's article "How to Build and      Use a Sawdust Stove" (on page 28 of issue 30), the solution      to my problem started to become clear.    </p>    <p>      MOM's stove consisted of a sawdust-filled container with a      chimney that was formed in its center by using a      broomstick. 1 began to play around with the chimney Idea .      . . until I came up with an iron-rod corkscrew      configuration that would act as a forming tool to wrap my      newsprint around. The design worked to perfection! Each      hollow newspaper log bums from the inside out, since the      coil creates a chimney <em>inside</em> the rolls. The      "flue" provides a rising draft, which supplies oxygen to      the fire, and-by automatically eliminating      ash-keeps exposing newsprint to the flames as the      fire bums. The length of combustion depends on the amount      of paper used: Five pounds will last about two hours, and      ten pounds will burn for about five. In addition, the      diameter of the corkscrew controls the temperature that the      blaze will reach. (I've found it best to use a core with a      diameter of at least three inches. A four-inch-diameter      tool, which exposes more burn area to the flames, will      allow the temperature to reach about 800Â°F!)    </p>    <p>      The results of my work were so encouraging that I promptly      went out and applied for a patent. I've since set up      displays in two local stove stores and have purchased      enough supplies to start manufacturing and marketing the      item. I invested $25 in office materials, $130 in iron rods      (coat hangers will not do, since they oxidize), and $65 in      patenting fees.    </p>    <p>      Though my business is still in the very initial stages,      I've already had my picture in <em>The Dallas Morning</em>      <em>News</em> , along with a write-up about my project . .      . as well as an offer from <em>Progressive Farmer's</em>      "Handy Devices" columnist to have my design featured in      that magazine. So I'm beginning to get some exposure now,      and I expect the wheels to start turning soon. I'm waiting      to hear from a number of manufacturers that might be      interested in my invention . . . and I just may send my      idea off to the President himself!    </p>    <p>      Roland Bell<br />      Fort Worth, Texas<br />      <br />    </p>        <p>      My family's main source of income is a seasonal summer      business, and that-as you'd imagine-leaves a      gaping hole in our budget during the winter months. So our      interest was aroused when we came across the article "You      Can Make Money in the Country With a Camera" in MOTHER NO.      33 (page 72).    </p>    <p>      My husband Russ and I have always been photography buffs,      and we were familiar with the developing process ... so we      decided to convert a small closet in our home into a      darkroom. Our $50 investment covered the installation of a      counter, a sink, and the necessary plumbing (most of the      job was done using scrap lumber and fittings that we      already had on hand). We were then faced with the rather      large expense of <em>stocking</em> our new work space: A      used darkroom setup with a color enlarger and a variety of      supplies came to $500 . . . chemicals, paper, and some      miscellaneous equipment totaled $200 . . . and we were in      business.    </p>    <p>      Instead of depending on commercial advertising to get our      enterprise off the ground, we let our friends and neighbors      do the job for us:    </p>    <p>      Over the years Russ and I had taken many pictures for our      own enjoyment, and members of our community had often      requested that we make them copies. For financial reasons,      we'd rarely been able to oblige . . . but we were soon to      have our chance! We approached our potential customers with      samples from our film file, and immediately began to take      orders! From there, our patrons took over by showing off      <em>their</em> purchases to family and friends.    </p>    <p>      Our endeavor is still in Its infancy, but we've already      taken on some fascinating photo assignments. Last      fall-for example-our area suffered a severe      storm, and we were called on, by many local residents, to      photograph damaged buildings for insurance records. To      date, our supplementary income has averaged only $35 to $50      per week. However, our earnings have been increasing slowly      but steadily, and the prospects look quite good for the      future. In the last few days alone, we've (following      another tip from MOM) scheduled shootings of several local      prize-winning fair animals, and we've been asked to put      together a photo feature of a 100year-old renovated      roadside inn for a popular decorating magazine!    </p>    <p>      Nancy C.
