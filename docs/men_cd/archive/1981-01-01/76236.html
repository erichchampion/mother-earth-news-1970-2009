                    <p>      As we've noted several times in these pages, Helen and      Scott Nearing are light years ahead of must <em>of</em>      <em>us when it comes to getting back to the land and living      a life</em> <em>of</em> <em>voluntary simplicity. As well      they should be, since they originally homesteaded a      run-down farm in Vermonts Green Mountains away back in the      autumn of 1932.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Life was good for the Nearings on that mini-farm . . .      until the slopes around them exploded into ski resorts in      the early 50's, forcing Helen and Scott to move on to a      rocky inlet on the coast</em> <em>of</em> <em>Maine and      start all over again.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that's where you'll find the Nearings today: still      clearing brush, still building honest stone houses (Helen      and .Scott are famous for their stone housed, and still      raising most of their vegetarian diet themselves in      unbelievably productive wholistic gardens . . . just as      they've been doing for nearly 50 years.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Naturally (in more ways than one), the Nearings have      learned a few things about homesteading and getting back to      basics over the years. And, lucky for all of us, they're      agreed to share some of that knowledge with MOTHER's      readers in a regular question and answer column. If you'd      like to get in on the action, send your question or      questions about self-sufficient living on the land to Helen      and Scott Nearing, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, N.C. 28791. And please don't expect      personal replies to your queries. The must important and      most frequently asked questions will be answered      here-and here only-where we</em> all <em>can      read what the Nearings have to say.</em>    </p>            <p>      <em>Do you use a chain saw to cut your wood, or have you      found a crosscut adequate for the task? (I hate to own a      fossil-fuel-burning tool if it isn't necessary! )</em>    </p>    <p>      We had a chain saw in Vermont and bought a second one in      Maine. In both cases, however, we gave them away . . .      because of the fumes, the vibration, and the noise. (And      also because we <em>enjoy</em> handsaws.) We have three bow      saws, ranging from 30" to 42" in length. (We've found the      42"-frame model to be clumsy unless two people are      operating it.) At least three-quarters of our wood is sawed      with the 30" bow saw, which is equipped with a thin, highly      tempered Swedish "Sandvik" blade.    </p>    <p>      <em>Do you feel any moral qualms about destroying a living      creature (a tree) that has a lifespan far greater than our      own, simply to provide yourself with fuel . . . or do you      cut exclusively standing and fallen deadwood?</em>    </p>    <p>      When a tree has matured and starts to deteriorate, we clear      it out and thus make room for new growth. We also cut down      dead, ailing, and misshapen trees, and pick up some      driftwood from the beach.    </p>    <p>      Yes, we do respect the life in a growIng tree, and dislike      cutting down such a beautiful being. Once, on a tree in a      public park in Madrid, Spain, we saw a sign on which the      following bit of wisdom was printed:    </p>    <p>      "I am the warmth of the hearth on cold winter nights. I am      the shade screening you from the summer sun. My fruits and      restoring drinks quench your thirst as you journey onward.      I am the beam that holds your house, the door of your      homestead, the bed on which you lie, and the timber that      builds your boat. I am the handle of your hoe, the wood of      your cra dle, and the shell of your coffin."    </p>    <p>      <em>My husband and I plan to move to a homestead in      northern Pennsylvania. This will be a new experience for      us, and we'll be looking for leadership and guidance from      experienced "pioneers" such as yourselves.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Could you supply us with a list-complete with      mailing address and prices (including postage and handling      costs)-of your publications, describing your years of      gardening and homesteading? (I'm sure such information has      probably appeared in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) in the      past, but we-and other new readers-would be      grateful for an update! )</em>    </p>    <p>      Anyone who wants a list of all our available books can      write us (Harborside, Maine 04842) for a listing. Please      enclose a self-addressed, stamped enve lope when you do.    </p>    <p>      <em>I'd like to know how-in your efforts to avoid the      use of unnecessary electrical and fossil-fueled      machines-you manage to deal with two rather mundane      chores: removing snow between your home and a plowed road,      and mowing grass around the house. (I find the latter act      to be necessary since an unmowed lawn attracts mosquitoes      and, in the summer months, tall dry grass can present a      fire hazard. It seems to me that a scythe and push mower      could be used, but that would take a lot of time that could      be spent on more pressing jobs.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Our new house is only 50 level feet from the town road, so      it's easy to shovel a path by hand. And we have no lawn or      meadows to bother with now, just woods behind the house and      a view over the bay in front.    </p>    <p>      When we lived in our previous home, however, Scott worked      out a way to cut his snow shoveling in half. We were      situated atop an inclined road, a good 250 feet from the      town highway. After snowstorms he simply shoveled this      distance, by hand, in 20-foot units: clearing 20 feet . . .      and then leaving 20 feet unshoveled. When going down the      hill, the car would reach the unshoveled spaces with      sufficient momentum to carry through the 20 feet of snow.      And, once the trail was broken in that manner, the auto      could get <em>back</em> <em>up</em> again without      difficulty.    </p>    <p>      There were meadows and a small lawn around our old house.      Scott scythed the high grass and considered it good morning      exercise, and pushing a hand mower around the tiny      handkerchief-sized lawn was no great chore for Helen.    </p>    <p>      <em>I live in Minnesota, at about the same latitude as your      home in Maine, so I believe our winter weather conditions      are similar. Currently, I'm helping a friend build a log      cabin from scratch . . . and we're thinking about using      stone and mortar to build up around the outside of the      cabin. What's your opinion of this approach?</em>    </p>    <p>      Why not build originally with field stone and mortar? We      wouldn't use anything else. Why try to apply a stone      structure to a wooden building? We have built one log      cabin, and felt it was not half as durable as our stone      homes have been.    </p>    <p>      <em>We are two couples in our early 30's who agree with      your view that cooperation is one of the keys to the      future. Collectively, we are of moderate means, and we have      several years of survival-skill building behind us. Last      summer we jointly purchased 40 acres of land . . . a site      which has good soil, available building materials, and an      existing, livable dwelling.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The four of us have spent the better part of a year      working on partnership agreements and such. However, we      don't know of many joint ventures of this kipd that have      succeeded. Could you provide us with some tips on how (and      how not) to successfully maintain a cooperative      relationship?</em>    </p>    <p>      Any collective effort will encounter difficulties unless      the people involved are cooperators <em>first</em> and      individuals second. However, most Americans have been      taught, meticulously, to be individuals first and to put      collective activities in a poor second place. (Indeed, we      often consider group action to be the next thing to      subversion.)    </p>    <p>      Therefore, your proposed collective endeavor has a strike      or two against it from the start. Try to overcome the      handicap by being certain that you have interests in      common-organic gardening, building, music, crafts,      etc. -and a mutually agreed-upon general philosophy      of life. (It's no secret that <em>religious</em>      experimental communities tend to survive much longer than      do others.)    </p>    <p>      Know each other well, too. Living in close proximity with      even the <em>nicest</em> people can result in a surprising      number of hassles and petty irritations, which can be      enough to rupture a relationship.    </p>    <p>      In short, be careful and consider well what you're      attempting. And, above all and forever, be considerate and      kind!    </p>
