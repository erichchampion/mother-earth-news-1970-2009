                    <p><strong>      This tasty, easy-to-grow ‘weed’ is a rich      source of omega-3s</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Frances Robinson    </h5>        <p>      Common in our yards but little known in the North American      kitchen, purslane is both delicious and exceptionally      nutritious. Common purslane (Portulaca oleracea) -      also known as duckweed, fatweed, pursley, pussley,      verdolagas and wild portulaca - is the most      frequently reported “weed” species in the      world. It can grow anywhere that has at least a two-month      growing season.    </p>    <p>      Until recently, most research on purslane has focused on      its eradication. A frequently overlooked approach to      controlling this weed is to eat it! Purslane is so      surprisingly tasty, North Carolina market gardener Patryk      Battle says, “I have rarely had anybody not buy      purslane after they’ve tried it.”    </p>    <p>      Purslane is somewhat crunchy and has a slight lemony taste.      Some people liken it to watercress or spinach, and it can      substitute for spinach in many recipes. Young, raw leaves      and stems are tender and are good in salads and sandwiches.      They can also be lightly steamed or stir-fried.      Purslane’s high level of pectin (known to lower      cholesterol) thickens soups and stews.    </p>    <p>      Battle also uses purslane in pesto. He throws basil and      purslane (upper stems and all) into a blender or food      processor, adds a small amount of olive oil, garlic, pine      nuts and enough hot water to get a good consistency.      Because it’s so juicy, purslane helps create a      low-fat pesto without too much oil.    </p>    <h3>      A nutrient-rich weed    </h3>    <p>      Purslane may be a common plant, but it is uncommonly good      for you. It tops the list of plants high in vitamin E and      an essential omega-3 fatty acid called alpha-linolenic acid      (ALA). Purslane provides six times more vitamin E than      spinach and seven times more beta carotene than carrots.      It’s also rich in vitamin C, magnesium, riboflavin,      potassium and phosphorus.    </p>    <p>      Omega-3s are a class of polyunsaturated essential fatty      acids. Your body cannot manufacture essential fatty acids,      so you must get them from food. Unfortunately, the typical      American diet contains too few omega-3s, a shortage that is      linked to a barrage of illnesses including heart disease,      cancer and Alzheimer’s disease.    </p>    <p>      ALA is most commonly found in plants and grass-fed meat and      eggs.r. Artemis Simopoulos, co-author of The Omega Diet,      says purslane is one of the richest known plant sources of      ALA: It contains 15 times the amount found in most iceberg      lettuce.    </p>    <p>      <br />      In addition to ALA, other omega-3s include eicosapentaenoic      (EPA) and docosahexaenoic (DHA) acids mostly found in      aquatic plants and animals, especially oily fish.      Nutritionists now think all forms of omega-3s need to be      plentiful in our diets p lants such as purslane may be part      of the missing link to better nutrition. Ethnobiologists      - scientists who study the relation between primitive      human societies and the plants in their environment -      believe that the plants humans ate long ago provided a      greater proportion of nutrients than the plants we consume      today. They estimate, for instance, that humans 40,000 to      10,000 years ago consumed an average of 390 milligrams per      day of vitamin C from wild plants and fruits. In contrast,      the average American today consumes just 88 milligrams of      vitamin C per day. One cup of cooked purslane has 25      milligrams (20 percent of the recommended daily intake) of      vitamin C    </p>    <h3>      Wild and cultivated    </h3>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Best Sources of Omega-3 Linolenic Acid      </h3>      <p>        (Grams* per 100-gram serving or approximately a half        cup.)      </p>      <p>        Sardines 0.5<br />        Trout, lake 0.4<br />        Tuna, albacore 0.2<br />        Egg, regular 0.05<br />        Egg, grass-fed 0.7<br />        Canola oil 11.1<br />        Flaxseed oil 53.5<br />        Soybean oil 6.8<br />        Soybeans, green 3.2<br />        Walnuts, English 6.8<br />        Purslane 0.4<br />        Lettuce, buttercrunch 0.03<br />        Spinach 0.09      </p>      <p>        <em>*Numbers compiled from various<br />        nutrition studies</em>      </p>    </div>    <p>      Purslane is an annual that thrives in rich soil and prefers      recently turned soils. Its leaves are smooth, thick and      paddle-shaped.epending on the variety, the leaves may grow      from one-half to 2 inches long. Wild purslane grows      horizontally and forms flat, circular mats up to 16 inches      across. Its round, thick stems radiate from the      plant’s center and are often reddish at the base.      About mid-July, purslane develops tiny, yellow flowers      about a quarter of an inch across that usually open only in      full sunlight.    </p>    <p>      After a week or so, the yellow flowers give way to small,      dark, pointed seed capsules that, when mature, break open      and release an abundance of tiny, black seeds, each about      the size of a grain of sand. Under ideal conditions, a      single purslane plant can produce up to 200,000 seeds!    </p>    <p>      If you do not find purslane growing wild, many companies      listed at right sell seeds for golden purslane (Portulaca      sativa) or garden purslane (Portulaca oleracea). These      varieties grow upright rather than horizontal and have      larger leaves than wild purslane. They also are more tender      and easier to harvest and clean.    </p>    <p>      Because it is susceptible to frost, purslane does not      emerge until the soil is quite warm. In most U.S. climates,      it can be sown starting in May. Plant the seeds in shallow      trenches 4 to 6 inches apart, then cover them lightly with      about a quarter inch of soil. Keep the planted seeds moist      until all the plants have sprouted. After the plants are      about 1 inch tall, they won’t need much attention.      Plants will be ready for harvesting in four to six weeks.    </p>    <h3>      Seed Sources    </h3>    <p>      <em>Johnny’s Selected Seeds<br />      (800) 854-2580<br />      <a href="http://www.johnnyseeds.com" target="_blank">www.johnnyseeds.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><br />      Nichols Garden Nursery<br />      (800) 422-3985<br />      <a href="http://www.nicholsgardennursery.com" target="_blank">www.nicholsgardennursery.com</a></em>    </p>    <p>      <em><br />      Territorial Seed<br />      (541) 942-9547<br />      <a href="http://www.territorial-seed.com" target="_blank">www.territorial-seed.com</a></em>    </p>
