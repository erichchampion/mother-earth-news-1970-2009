                <p>      COUNTRY LORE    </p>            <p>      VEGETABLES TASTE MUCH BETTER when cooked in chicken stock      rather than water, and a few tablespoons of the broth will      enhance any stir-fried dish. Since such cooking calls for      only small amounts of liquid, I no longer use quart jars to      freeze homemade stock. Instead, I pour about a half cup of      stock into each of 12 plastic sandwich bags that I've      distributed among the compartments of a muffin tin. The tin      goes into the freezer until the stock is solid, then the      individual bags are kept frozen until needed. They take up      very little room in the freezer, and if I want to thaw the      stock before using it, that's easily done in the microwave      oven.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Laddie Nichols<br /></em> <em>Lakeside, Arizona</em>    </p>    <h3>A Hard Nut to Crack</h3><p>I have a trick that makes it easier to shell black    walnuts, butternuts and hickory nuts. I put them in a pail,    cover them with hot water, lay a small rug over the top to    keep the heat in, and let them stand for about two hours.    After draining off the water, I put the nuts in a mesh bag    (like an onion sack) and hang them to dry for half a day. The    shells are thus softened, so they crack more easily, and I    often am able to pick out the nutmeats whole, or at least in    halves.</p>    <p>      <em>-William</em> <em>J. Higgins<br /></em> <em>Little      Valley, New York</em>    </p>    <h3>Put It in Paper</h3>    <p>      Have you ever looked into a cupboard that's overflowing      with plastic storage containers and old glass jars, yet      been unable to find a size just right for the food you      wanted to freeze or refrigerate? I use various sizes of      paper cups; they're inexpensive and disposable, and a wide      selection can be stacked in a small space. I use them to      freeze individual portions of ground meat, soups, stews and      casseroles, as these defrost so much faster than large      amounts. Frozen berries make a nice addition to a lunch      box, keeping the contents cool while defrosting just in      time for dessert. I use these cups for all sorts of      storage, and though lids can be bought at restaurant-supply      stores, I usually make my own with freezer-quality plastic      wrap and rubber bands.    </p>    <p>      <em>-William H. Welsch<br />      Lewiston, California</em>    </p>    <h3>      Magic Powder    </h3>    <p>      My mother always kept a small tin of talcum powder in the      kitchen. When any grease splattered on her clothes, she      would sprinkle a little talcum on the spots. After 20 or 30      minutes she brushed off the powder, and the spots were gone      too.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mrs. F. W. Brown<br /></em> <em>Nairobi, Kenya</em>    </p>    <h3>Where's the Beef?</h3>    <p>      How many times have you decided to have ground beef for      dinner and realized that you waited too long and there's no      time for it to thaw? Or maybe you pull out a solid      two-pound lump, and your recipe requires only a pound. Next      time you freeze any ground meat, put it in a large plastic      bag with a zip closure. (A gallon-sized bag works well for      up to three pounds of meat.) Flatten the meat evenly with a      rolling pin, then squeeze out all the air and seal the bag.      Make two deep creases across the meat, one lengthwise and      one crosswise, dividing it into quarters. The thin patty      will freeze and defrost quickly, and you can open the bag      to break off a quarter if that's all you need.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Frances R. Ransom<br /></em> <em>Placentia,      California</em>    </p>    <h3>Ah, So . . . Good!</h3>    <p>      Chinese stir-fried meals make the delicious most of fresh      vegetables, a small amount of meat and little      oil-perfect for today's more nutritious eating. Many      such dishes call for chopped gingerroot, which, though      expensive, is used just a bit at a time. To keep it fresh      for months, wash and peel a medium-sized root, cut it into      one-eighth-inch slices, and place them in a clean glass      jar, covered with dry sherry. Keep the ginger in the      refrigerator, ready to use. The spiced wine also adds      special flavor to marinades.    </p>    <p>      <em>-M. Waldsmith<br /></em> <em>Ridgecrest,      California</em>    </p>    <h3>Hot off the Griddle</h3>    <p>      I'll bet I flip the lightest, fluffiest wholewheat pancakes      ever made. I mix three eggs, two cups of milk, one-half cup      of oil, one tablespoon of brown sugar and one teaspoon of      salt in a blender for three minutes or until the liquid is      frothy. Then I add two cups of whole wheat flour and one or      two teaspoons of baking soda, and mix the batter by hand.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ralph Parillo<br /></em> <em>Bellflower,      California</em>    </p>    <h3>My Juice Runneth Over</h3>    <p>      A good fruit pie almost always bubbles over as it bakes,      leaving the cook with a mess to clean up, whether on the      oven floor or on a flat pan beneath the pie plate. While      that juice is still sizzling, I pour salt over the spills.      They then burn to a crisp and can be easily scraped up with      a spatula.    </p>    <p>      -Ruth E. Rhaesa<br />      Overland Park, Kansas    </p>    <h3>Carrot Trick</h3>    <p>      Warm whole carrots under hot water, or by putting them in      the microwave for a few seconds, before making them into      strips or slices. They'll cut more easily without cracking      or breaking.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Mrs. Robert Spencer<br /></em> <em>New Carlisle,      Ohio</em>    </p>    <h3>Hands Off</h3>    <p>      A meat grinder is a great help when drying your own hot      peppers. Just wash and de-stem the peppers, and put them      through the grinder, using the largest blade. Wear rubber      or plastic gloves if you touch the ground vegetables, as      the juices will burn your skin. When prepared like this,      the peppers dry quickly in a dehydrator, on a screen, or in      a 135°F oven with the door partly open. Stir them      occasionally while they're drying, and store them in      airtight containers. Check the containers after a few      days-if any drops of moisture have formed, repeat the      drying process. For powdered pepper, put some of the dried      chunks into a blender, and whiz them on high for two or      three minutes.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Pamela</em> <em>F. Woodside<br /></em> <em>Lafayette,      Louisiana</em>    </p>    <h3>Crisp and Crunchy</h3>    <p>      It's easy to have "homemade crackers" on hand for guests      and snacks. Just cut thin-sliced, dense bread (like      Pepperidge Farm) into quarters, arrange the pieces in a      single layer on cookie sheets, and bake them for one hour      at 100°F. One loaf of bread makes dozens of crisp      squares, which should be stored in an airtight container.      These are delicious with all kinds of spreads, and they're      economical too.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Elizabeth Janes<br /></em> <em>San Francisco,      California</em>    </p>    <h3>For Speedy Salads</h3>    <p>      To save time when fixing meals, I keep chopped onions,      carrots and celery on hand. When tightly covered, the      onions and carrots store well in the refrigerator, but,      within a few days, chopped celery will turn gray and      unappetizing. My solution is to stir mayonnaise into the      celery; it stays fresh for quite a while when refrigerated,      and it's great to have that mixture to quickly turn out      potato, macaroni, crabmeat and other salads.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ellene Christiansen<br /></em> <em>Owings Mills,      Maryland</em>    </p>    <h3>Plunk, Plunk-No More Gunk</h3>    <p>      Do you have vases, bottles or thermos liners that remain      cloudy or dirty, even after being scrubbed with a brush?      Try filling the container with warm water and adding two to      four denture-cleansing tablets. When the fizzing stops, the      glass will be clean and shiny.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Michelle Kaptur<br /></em> <em>Bend, Oregon</em>    </p>
