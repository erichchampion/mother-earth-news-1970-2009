                <p>      TO YOUR HEALTH    </p>            <p>      The Chinese heart-disease rate can teach us a cholesterol      lesson.    </p>    <p>      <em>When it concerns the fitness of body, mind or spirit,      the editors of</em> <em>American Health are there, staying      on top of up-to-date medical research, separating fad from      fact and helping you preserve and improve life's most      precious gift your good health. Here are just a few items      culled from recent and upcoming issues, including further      proof on the interesting and complex relationship between      diet and health.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHEN BLOOD CHOLESTEROL IS</strong> UN der 180      mg/dl, heart disease is uncommon; below 150, it's      practically nonexistent. In China, the average level is      127. In Western countries, it's 212. Dietary differences      between China and the West-such as fat intake, which      health experts advise us to keep under 30% of our daily      caloric intake-may account for much of that      difference. A six-year study of Chinese diet and disease      patterns, the most comprehensive ever undertaken on diet      and health, has also shown that, except for high levels of      sodium, the Chinese diet-which, as you probably know,      is largely vegetarian with small amounts of animal      products-is nutritionally superior, even in iron      intake.    </p>    <p>      Surveying the Chinese enabled researchers to evaluate what      effects such low cholesterol levels have on the human      system. It turns out that not only does heart disease      decline, but colon cancer does too; this suggests that      earlier studies that linked low cholesterol levels to colon      cancer were misleading. In fact, the rate of heart disease      among men in China is one-sixteenth that in the U.S. (among      women, one-sixth), while the rate for colon cancer is only      about 40%.    </p>    <h3>      Read, Look, and Learn    </h3>    <p>      Unlike other nutrition-oriented newsletters, <em>Easy Low      Fat Living</em> offers little news or reporting, but it      does have food charts and plenty of recipes, plus tips on      lowering the fat content of your own favorite recipes. The      newsletter costs $24 a year for 12 issues; to order, call      203/336-5426.    </p>    <p>      For further guidance, <em>Cholesterol Control: An Eater's      Guide</em> offers a half-hour tour of one family's      successful approach to low-fat shopping, cooking, eating      out and entertaining. At the 19th annual National      Educational Film and Video Festival, the video won a Bronze      Apple award. Price $29.95. For more information, call      800/669-1955.    </p>    <h3>      Anticancer Tobacco?    </h3>    <p>      A California biotech firm hopes to field-test a genetic      engineering process that makes tobacco plants mass-produce      proteins used in anticancer drugs. If successful-and      financially practical-the technology could turn      tobacco farmers into allies in the war on cancer.    </p>    <p>      Biosource Genetics Corporation of Vacaville, California,      has developed a genetic engineering technique that      "hijacks" the tobacco plant's genetic machinery and forces      it to produce the cancer-fighting proteins interferon and      interleukin 2. According to the company, the plant could      even be used to produce melanin, a natural pigment that      protects skin from the cancer-causing effects of      ultraviolet radiation; it could be the ultimate sunscreen.    </p>    <p>      The so-called "transient gene expression system" consists      of spliced-together pieces of RNA viruses that do little on      their own. However, once sprayed on a growing plant, they      behave like genes and temporarily turn the plant into a      "factory" for producing useful protein products. Biosource      considers the process safe because the virus can't get      inside the plant's seeds or reproductive machinery.    </p>    <p>      According to the biotech firm, a farmer would simply plant      a normal crop of tobacco or grain, peppers, tomatoes or      potatoes then, during the growing season, would decide      which protein to produce. (Although nearly any major crop      plant can be used, the tobacco plant is preferred because      so much is known about its genes and growth.) At some point      the plants would be harvested, and the proteins extracted      through another patented process.    </p>    <h3>      Are You Covered?    </h3>    <p>      We should expect more from health insurance than just the      standard basic coverage for doctor's office diagnoses,      hospitalization, X rays and other tests, says the Health      Policy Agenda for the American People. This health-care      think tank, established by the American Medical      Association, has come up with a consensus on just which      health insurance benefits should be included in the basic      package. Some benchmark benefits are well-child checkups      and immunizations; periodic medical screenings; inpatient      substance-abuse treatment; 30 days of mental health      hospitalization; up to 50 visits a year for mental health      services; up to 30 visits for home care; 45 days at a      nursing home; and hospice care.    </p>    <p>      With the coalition's model policy in hand, consumers can      more easily comparison shop for insurance or check existing      plans for specific types of coverage and services. For a      copy of the policy, contact Health Care    </p>    <p>      Some 4.8 million US. children are bullies or victims of      bullying.    </p>    <p>      Agenda for the American People, 535 North Dearborn St.,      Chicago, IL 60610; 312/6454399.    </p>    <h3>      Asthmatic Aerobics    </h3>    <p>      Though conventional medical wisdom advises asthmatics to      avoid physical exertion on the basis that it can trigger      attacks, Aerobics for Asthmatics-a program started      two years ago by Silver Spring, Maryland, allergists      Stanley Wolf and Kathy Lampl-has shown that moderate      exercise can actually <em>help</em> patients breathe      easier. The twice weekly, 45-minute aerobic dance sessions      don't change the patients' lung capacity, but the strength      of their voluntary chest muscles improves substantially.    </p>    <p>      The program has been so successful that Wolf and Lampl have      packaged it as a videotape for home use. To obtain a copy,      send $33.95 to the Allergy Center, 10301 Georgia Ave.,      Silver Spring, MD 20902. (Be sure to obtain your doctor's      permission before starting any exercise program.) If you're      asthmatic and need more encouragement to get off the couch,      consider this: Of the 611 U.S. athletes who competed in the      Seoul Summer Olympics, 52 were asthmatic. Fifteen of these      athletes-including superstar Jackie      JoynerKersee-won medals.    </p>    <h3>      Less Is Best    </h3>    <p>      Although the benefits of aerobics are indisputable, keep      this in mind: A new study from the University of North      Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill has found that      the more often you take an aerobics class, the more likely      you are to get hurt. It seems that 60% of the people who      take aerobics classes four or more times a week report      being injured, while only 43% who take less than four      classes a week get hurt. The most common injuries occur in      the lower extremities-the shin, calf and ankle.    </p>    <h3>      Besting Bullies    </h3>    <p>      It's been estimated that 4.8 million American children are      either bullies or victims of bullying. However, the      traditional adult response has been to ignore bullying or      to regard it as an inevitable rite of passage. Late ly, due      to bullying attacks that ended with the suicides of their      young victims, educators here and in Japan, Sweden and      Norway are waking up to the long-term consequences of      bullying. The bullies themselves do not go unscathed: The      same children who rough up others and talk back to teachers      are likelier as adults to commit crimes, abuse spouses,      work at menial jobs-and raise a new crop of bullies.      Yet, when Norwegian teachers and parents joined forces,      they cut bullying incidents in half.    </p>    <p>      School officials, however, can't solve a problem if they      don't know it exists. George Butterfield of the National      School Safety Center advises parents to report incidents      promptly and to be aware of signs of victimization, such as      torn clothing and bruises, stomachaches, dropping grades or      unexplained anxiety. Parents seem only to make matters      worse by confronting the bully or his parents or telling      their children to fight back. After all, bullies rarely      pick on anyone their own size.    </p>    <p>      For more information on parental involvement in besting      bullies, contact the National School Safety Center, 16830      Ventura Blvd., Suite 200, Encino, CA 91436.    </p>    <h3>      Stop the Bed-Wetting Blues    </h3>    <p>      Because an allergic reaction can irritate the detrusor      muscle in the lining of the bladder, causing it to spasm      and contract, an increasing number of doctors believe that      many bed wetters are reacting to something they've eaten or      even inhaled in the past day or so. An allergy can also      cause the sphincter muscle at the mouth of the bladder to      swell, preventing it from tightening enough to stop the      flow of urine until the child wakes. This means the bed      wetter may respond to sudden urges successfully during the      daytime but sleep right through them at night. It doesn't      help that many allergic children are very heavy sleepers.    </p>    <p>      If your child wets the bed, you can test the allergy theory      yourself. Feed your young one only five of the least      allergenic foods-lamb, rice, cherries, spinach and      carrots-for five days. A dry bed at the end of that      time almost surely means an allergy, probably to something      eaten regularly. To identify the problem food, add one of      the following greatest offenders every day, in its pure      form: a glass of milk, an apple, roasted peanuts, plain      popcorn, a few spoons of wheat germ, a soft-boiled egg, a      pork chop, a piece of bittersweet chocolate, an orange. If      the bed stays dry for two days after your child has eaten a      particular food, you can consider that food safe and keep      it a part of your child's diet. However, if your child wets      the bed after having been served one of the major      offenders, you've found the culprit-or one of them.    </p>    <p>      A child who wets during the test-diet interval may be      allergic to one of the testerfoods, so eliminate them, one      by one. The problem may also be something in the air, so      try changing the feather pillow and putting out the cat. If      these measures fail, allergies probably aren't the cause of      the problem.    </p>    <p>      Almost all bed-wetting disappears about two years before      puberty begins, when the pelvic cavity expands and there's      less pressure on the bladder. This usually occurs earlier      for girls than boys, since girls mature faster.    </p>    <h3>      Periodontal Disease-s-s-s!    </h3>    <p>      As microbiologists link specific bacteria (or "bug combos")      to specific gum problems and treatments, it's now clear      that periodontal disease is actually a group of diseases      with different causes, targets and rates of progression. Of      some 300 good and bad bugs that inhabit the mouth, eight to      20 have been linked to gum disease so far.    </p>    <p>      Gingivitis-an early and reversible form-is      characterized by bleeding, inflamed gums and persistent bad      breath. Left unchecked, gingivitis can progress into      full-blown disease. The symptoms and bacteria vary      depending on the cause. For example, the most common form      is associated with poor oral hygiene and plaque buildup.      Other factors contributing to the development of      gingivitis-and more serious gum disease-include      smoking or the use of smokeless tobacco, pregnancy, the      Pill, epilepsy drugs, steroids, stress, reduced saliva flow      (a side effect of some 400 drugs), anemia, diabetes and      eating disorders.    </p>    <p>      Because we now know the bacteria are disease-specific, it's      important to get a correct diagnosis and treatment plan      from your dentist or periodontist.    </p>
