        For many of us, decorating a Christmas tree is our favorite part ofthe holiday season. If you're one of the more than 30 millionpeople who put up a live tree this year, you might want to considerextending its usefulness once the season ends. Instead of tossingyour perfectly shaped pine or fir into the garbage where it willonly end up in a landfill, try one of these creative recyclingavenues:<br /><br /><b>1. Throw it in the water.</b> Christmas trees make great habitatfor fish. Just toss it in your pond or stream. If you don't happento have a fishin' hole on your property, contact local conservationgroups. In many areas, they'll pick up the tree and toss it into anappropriate pond or stream for you.<br /><br /><b>2. Keep it on your land.</b> Trees can provide lodging for allkinds of critters besides fish. If you have a suitable place onyour property to let a tree decompose, it can become a nursery toinsects, fungi and possibly even amphibians and reptiles. Orconsider keeping it in its stand and placing it out of doors as abird sanctuary; it will provide our feathered friends much-neededprotection from wind and cold. You can even enjoy a second round ofdecorating by adorning the tree with enticing bird food:<br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Suet smeared in the branches</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Pine cones coated with peanut butter and bird seed, then hungfrom branches</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Strings of popcorn, cranberries or raisins wrapped around thetree</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Hanging fruit slices</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><br /><b>3. Use it in the garden.</b> Trim branches off and place themover perennial beds to reduce frost heaving caused by freezing andthawing. Then use the trunks to create sturdy, homemade trellisesor tomato stakes.<br /><br /><b>4. Toss it in the stove.</b> Use a few dry branches as kindlingto start your fires.<br /><br /><b>5. Keep it in your community.</b> Many communities have treerecycling programs that turn everyone's old trees into valuablemulch. If you are unable to try any of the above ideas, contactyour Public Works Department to find out if they will collect treescurbside or from a central drop-off location.
