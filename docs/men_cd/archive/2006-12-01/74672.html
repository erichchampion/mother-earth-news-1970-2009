        <h5>December/January 2007 Issue #219</h5><h2>Readers’ tips to live by: Unique Homemade Holiday Gifts</h2><h3>Wholesome Bread</h3><p>I have baked bread for more than 30 years. I developed this recipe to get as much whole wheat as possible into a light, moist bread. I use coarse-ground wheat and high-protein, high-gluten premium whole-wheat flour from <a href="http://www.dakota-prairie.com/" target="_blank">Dakota Prairie Organic Flour Co</a>.</p><p>The keys to this recipe are the high-protein, high-gluten whole-wheat flour, the coarse-ground wheat that keeps the bread moist, and the six hours it takes for the dough to rise, absorb the moisture and build a strong yeast.</p><p><strong>Rickert’s Whole-wheat Bread</strong><br /><em>3 cups coarse-ground wheat</em><br /><em>5½ cups fresh whole-wheat flour</em><br /><em>5 tsp yeast</em><br /><em>6¼ cups water</em><br /><em>½ cup honey</em><br /><em>? cup canola oil</em><br /><em>3 tbsp ground flaxseed (optional)</em><br /><em>5 tsp salt</em><br /><em>About 7 to 8 cups white bread flour</em></p><p>First, mix the coarse-ground wheat, whole-wheat flour, yeast and water in a large bowl. Cover and let rise for six hours. Then, stir in the rest of the ingredients, except for the white bread flour. Add the white bread flour, 1 cup at a time, stirring with a heavy wooden spoon until the dough becomes too thick to stir. Now, knead the dough, adding the remainder of the white bread flour.</p><p>Next, cover the dough with a towel and let it rise until it doubles-about 1½ hours.</p><p>Sprinkle a little white flour on the countertop, then punch down the dough and form five equal loaves. Place one dough loaf on each end of a cookie sheet, and three dough loaves lengthwise in the middle.</p><p>Make three cuts in the top of each loaf. Let the loaves rise in a warm place until a dimple made with your finger won’t bounce back.</p><p>Last, bake at 375 degrees for about 40 minutes. After baking, place each loaf on a rack and let cool for six hours or more.</p><p>Eat one loaf, freeze one loaf and you’ll still have three loaves to give as gifts.</p><h5>MICHAEL W. RICKERT<br />Reinbeck, Iowa</h5><h3>Jiffy Jeans Purse</h3><p>I have been making purses out of blue jeans my children have outgrown. I find that children’s size eight or smaller works best. I line the purses with a new bandanna, about 21 inches square, or other leftover material I have on hand. The handles are available at craft stores in a variety of styles and colors.</p><p><strong>Make the purse:</strong> Depending on how long you want the purse to be, cut off the jeans legs somewhere below the crotch and above the knees (which probably have holes in them anyway). Cut off the inside-leg seam all the way up one leg and down the other leg. You want the inside edges of the two legs to be fairly parallel so you can sew them together to make a square bottom to the purse.</p><p>Turn the pants inside out and sew the two front leg pieces together and then the two back leg pieces together. Sew across the bottom of the legs to make a tube. Turn the jeans purse right side out.</p><p><strong>Line the purse:</strong> Fold a bandanna or other similar-sized piece of material in half. As a guide, lay the jeans purse on top of the material. Cut the lining material about an inch wider than the purse on each side. Stitch the sides of the bandanna together to form a pouch. Fold over about a half-inch around the top of the bandanna pouch and iron it flat. Insert the bandanna-pouch lining into the purse and pin the folded top of the bandanna to the inside of the waistband. Stitch the bandanna to the waistband, but stop and restart the sewing each time you come to a belt loop, so that the handles, with their curved ends, can slip into the belt loops for carrying.</p><h5>CINDY LINDSAY<br />Osage City, Kansas</h5><h3>From Greeting Cards to Garden Kits</h3><p>Here are 16 homemade holiday gift ideas from the <em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em> editors:</p><ul><li>Personalized greeting cards using card stock, available from any office supply store.

To assemble it, all you need are several feet of rope and some scraps of lumber that are at least 1½ inches wide and five-eighths-inch thick.</p><p>You’ll need three pieces of wood, each 22 inches long, for the spreader bars. Drill four half-inch holes through each piece of wood, spaced 6 inches apart on each board, with 2 inches left at either end of each stick. Next, in two (only two) of the spreader bars, drill an additional hole at the end of each bar, about 1 inch in from the end.</p><p>Cut four 3-foot lengths of rope and tie a knot in one end of each. In one of the six-holed spreader bars, thread each rope piece through the four interior holes and tie four more knots on the other side of the bar, so that the wood is held securely between the knots.</p><p>Tie another knot 10½ inches down on each rope. Thread the four ropes through the four-holed spreader bar, until it’s tight against these knots, and tie four more knots to hold it in place. Then, go down another 10½ inches of rope, tie four more knots, slip on the remaining six-holed bar, tie a final four knots to anchor it, and cut off the loose ends of the rope.</p><p>Last, add two pieces of 3-foot-long rope to the outside holes for handles, and you have a foolproof wood carrier.</p><h5><em><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></em><br />September/October 1978</h5><h3>Share Your Wisdom</h3><p>Have you learned some trick of the trade, secret formula or way to work more sustainably around the homestead?
