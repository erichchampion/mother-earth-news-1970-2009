                    <h5 id="byline">    by Jeff Aldrich, Ph.D.  </h5>      <p><em>Make a homemade trap to collect      these soldier bugs in early spring, then release them to      control all kinds of garden pests.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As alternatives to toxic pesticides, scientists have      developed a number of</em> nontoxic <em>lures to attract      and trap pest insects. Perhaps most familiar are the      Japanese beetle lures and traps. But these arid other pest      lures usually dont work very well on the small scale of a      home garden because they actually may attract more pests      than initially were present.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>There is one lure, developed by Jeff Aldrich, an      entomologist with the U.S.</em> <em>Department of</em>      Agriculture, <em>that</em> <em>attracts one</em> <em>of the      best beneficial insects. Aldrich invites</em> <em>MOTHER      EARTH</em> <em>NEWS readers to help hire test this nifty      homemade Soldier Bug Trap arid Nursery Technique.      -</em> <em><strong>MOTHER</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Spined soldier bugs (Podisus maculiventris) are valuable      beneficial insects in home gardens because they prey on a      multitude of pests, including Mexican bean beetles, cabbage      loopers, diamondback moths, army worms and other      caterpillars, flea beetles and Colorado potato beetles.      When prey is not available, soldier bugs survive by feeding      on plant sap, without significantly harming the plant.    </p>    <p>      Spined soldier bugs can be found throughout the United      States and Canada. They are more common in the East,      especially around deciduous forests and meadows, which      provide natural prey and cover for the adults to survive      the winter.    </p>    <p>      So how can gardeners enlist the soldier bugs at the right      time to combat garden pests?    </p>    <p>      The Soldier Bug Nursery has shown promising results for      home gardeners as a pest control technique. The technique      relies on a pheromone (a natural chemical attractant)      produced by male soldier bugs, which we identified and      patented in our research at the U.S. Department of      Agriculture/ Agricultural Research Station's Insect      Behavior Lab. It is available commercially as the Soldier      Bug Attractor (available from Planet Natural,      www.planetnatural.com <em>).</em> You can use the Attractor      to draw spined soldier bugs to your garden at any time.    </p>        <p>      With the nursery technique, you can trap the soldier bugs      when they first emerge in spring (before they lay their      eggs), store them in a nursery cage or the refrigerator and      then move them into your garden, where they will lay eggs      and produce hundreds of hungry nymphs.    </p>		<p><strong>TRAPPING SOLDIER BUGS</strong></p>    <p>      Purchase the soldier bug pheromone lure to use in early      spring. In nature, males use their pheromone to attract a      mate, but other males also go to the vicinity of a calling      male in an effort to intercept females. Spined soldier bug      adults are strong fliers and, during responsive phases of      their life cycle, will fly toward the pheromone from      considerable distances.    </p>    <p>      Generally, soldier bugs are easy to capture. Because they      will walk to the pheromone source, the traps for capturing      soldier bugs must allow easy access while preventing their      exit. The trap described at right takes advantage of the      soldier bugs' tendency to crawl upward, but not downward.    </p>		<div class="sidebar">    <h3>      Soldier bug Trap    </h3>    <p>      <strong>1</strong> Cut off the top third of a 2-liter soda      bottle, and then cut off the screw-cap tip. This is your      "funnel."    </p>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/196-92-i3.jpg" alt="196-92-i3.jpg" width="81" height="180" />    </div>    <p>      <strong>2</strong> Cut off the top two-thirds of a second soda bottle,      leaving the cap on. This is the trap body. Put a few small      slits around the top to release the pheromone scent. Cut a      wooden stake, about 3 feet long, that will fit through the      hole in your funnel, but will allow at least 1/2-inch of      clearance so the bugs can crawl in. Hammer the stake into      the ground where you want to place the trap. The best sites      are along the edges of wooded areas with plenty of brush      and leaf litter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong> Slide the funnel over the stake as      shown.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4</strong> Finally, lay a soldier-bug pheromone      lure (not shown) in the trap's body. Slide the body onto      the stake, and push the funnel section up into the bottom      of the body. Tape or staple the bottom edges of the trap.    </p></div>    <p>      <strong>TRAP TIMING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Soldier bug adults overwinter under duff, fallen leaves and      the bark of dead trees. Just prior to the bud burst of      deciduous trees (a good indicator is when red maple trees      shed their pollen), the adult bugs come out of their      hibernation (known as <em>diapause</em> ) in a      synchronized, massive emergence. <strong>Put your traps out      before they emerge.</strong> The bugs soon mate, if they      had not already done so the previous fall, and the females      lay eggs on tree bark and vegetation (about 20 eggs per      cluster; about 300 eggs per female). Eggs hatch in a week      or less depending on temperature. There are five nymphal      stages, each lasting about a week if the nymphs are well      fed, followed by the final molt to the adult stage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STORING AND USING SOLDIER BUGS</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can transfer the trapped bugs into a nursery area in      your garden. The simplest nursery cage is a cylinder of      aluminum window screen set upright over an area where      insect prey may be present, such as a patch of an      overwintered cover crop or kale. After making the cylinder,      fold the top of the cylinder over and pin it shut with      clothespins. Bank soil around the bottom of the cage so the      adult bugs can't escape To assure the bugs have enough food      if insect prey is scarce, place some apple slices in the      nursery.    </p>    <p>      The window-screen cage will hold both adults and nymphs. If      you want to move the nursery every few days to new crops,      rattle the cage a bit: Most of the adult soldier bugs will      fly up and land on the screen. Then you can move the      nursery to a new location.    </p>    <p>      Make an even more effective nursery by using 1/8 inch      hardware cloth instead of window screen. This material      allows the soldier bug nymphs to escape and move out into      the garden, while the larger adults stay confined and      continue to lay eggs.    </p>    <p>      You also can keep trapped soldier bugs in the refrigerator      for a few weeks to delay their egg-laying until more garden      crops are up and growing. Every few days, take them out of      the refrigerator for a few hours so they can warm up, drink      and feed. Lightly mist them with water and give them some      apple slices.    </p>    <p>      Later in the spring you can place the nursery cage right in      the middle of your potato patch, or wherever you need pest      control. Add the bugs you've been storing in the      refrigerator: They will lay their eggs and their hungry      little nymphs will protect your crops.    </p>
