            			 			 			 <div class="sidebar">		<p>      The following letter appeared in MOTHER'S "Positions and      Situations" section, March 1974:    </p>    <p>      I'm a Cancer Lady with two boys, recently immigrated to      Canada and working on a farm near Toronto as housekeeper      and barn help. I enjoy the work and am learning a lot but      am getting lonely ... I'm 31, black, tall (5'9") and sorta      freaky for around here. Especially lacking is any male      companionship. I'm partial to tall men after a lifetime      spent looking down at the tops of folks' heads. I'm a hell      of a good cook and am skilled at gardening, canning,      raising rabbits, sewing and minor carpentry (have also      begun to handspin wool) so favor a man with a country      lifestyle over a city-minded dude.    </p>    <p>      Leni Ashmore<br />      Orangeville, Ontario.    </p></div>        <p>Well, well, well. I certainly asked for it! I received 68      letters in reply, quite a few from Canadians one from      Alaska and the rest from all over the United States. The      most important letter, though, was from the man who would,      before the year was over, become my husband, father to my      two boys, and eventually the father of our own two      children. </p>    <p>      Through the spring and summer of 1974, Kip Sorensen and I      wrote back and forth and talked on the phone; me from my      farm job in Ontario and him from his job on a wheat farm in      the northeastern hills of South Dakota. Early in August my      13-year-old son and I took the Canadian National Railway      west from Ontario. We stopped in Winnipeg, crossed the      border into South Dakota and met Kip. To make a long story      short, we met, sparks flew, and on Sept. 24 my boys and I      arrived back in South Dakota to stay. I've always been one      to make my mind up fast.    </p>    <p>      When we began our life together we lived on a rented farm.      The rent was cheap in exchange for overseeing cattle on      several hundred acres of rolling pasture. In exchange for      repairs on a sagging front porch, a neighbor gave us a      flock of laying hens. For a sack of onions, another farmer      gave us two bottle lambs. Sioux Bee Honey gave us 150      pounds of honey for letting them place a flatbed trailer      full of hives in the pasture.    </p>    <p>      During our second summer together we moved onto the      Sorensen's farm in Flandreau, South Dakota. Kip's      grandfather, a Danish immigrant, homesteaded the farm in      1881. Kip converted the farm's granary building into a      great house: one big room with three sleeping lofts and a      greenhouse. Our old Home Comfort cookstove kept us warm and      well fed.    </p>    <p>      Just after the birth of our daughter, Winter, we began to      farm more. Kip grew edible beans (pintos and Great      Northerns) while I milked cows and kept chickens, ducks,      pigs, turkeys and sheep. The soil on our farm was      wonderful, and with the aid of the greenhouse we grew      almost three acres of veggies - enough to share with      elderly in-laws, family and friends, and enough left to      sell some at the Sioux Falls farmer's market. We sold all      kinds of things from the farm: weaner pigs, lambs for      slaughter, sheared wool for handspinners, chicken fryers      and eggs, as well as yogurt and fresh cheese from our      jersey cows.    </p>    <p>      Two years after the birth of Bjorn, our youngest son, a      blow fell on what was an increasingly productive and      exciting farm life. The federal government's Farm Home      Administration unilaterally called in all the small farm      loans in eastern South Dakota. It was the worst of the 1982      farm crisis and we got caught up and spit out along with      many others that year. In addition to farming, Kip worked      full time remodeling and building houses. So we knew we      could survive, but not on the farm. The downturn in the      economy meant that Kip's carpentry work also was hard hit.      We made the painful decision to leave South Dakota.    </p>        <p>      Our decision to move to Virginia came from the opportunity      to settle near friends in the Piedmont of the Blue Ridge.      We were fortunate that the bleak building prospects in the      Midwest were not the case in central Virginia. Kip      immediately began to build and restore log cabins and has      moved on to build custom homes, as well as create custom      cabinetry and furniture.    </p>    <p>      I continue to garden in the Piedmont's clay soil, but      Virginia has restrictive laws on farm product sales:      Unpasteurized milk (cow or goat), homemade cheese and      butchered meat cannot be sold by private citizens. Once we      were settled here it was clear I needed an income other      than farming. Early in 1983, I began my career as a      costumed historic-house interpreter. My longtime interest      in African American history became the foundation for my      work over the past 15 years as a consultant to museums and      historic houses.    </p>    <p>      In 1988, an opportunity to attend college presented itself      through a degree program at Mary Baldwin College - I      snatched it. Now I am working to complete my doctorate in      American Studies from the College of William & Mary. I      also am the Director of the Reynolds Homestead, an historic      house museum and continuing education center owned by      Virginia Tech. Much of what I learned while farming in      South Dakota still plays an important part in what I teach      to the public and to undergraduate students -      American rural history of the 18th and 19th centuries.    </p>    <p>      Kip is building us a new house to replace our 100-year-old      farmhouse that burned to the ground just before Christmas      2000. It was determined that the rear chimney cracked open,      high in the second story. As hard as it was to lose so many      of our cherished possessions we were grateful Kip wasn't      hurt - he dived buck-naked out a second-story window      into the snow at three in the morning just before the roof      collapsed! At the time I was in Seattle visiting our      daughter and son-in-law.    </p>    <p>      The new house is going up on the footprint of the old      house. It is only one story, has an open-plan interior and      is full of windows for light. The western cedar siding      gives the house a rich glow, especially in the fanned      pattern in the gables. Kip chose oriented strand board for      the subfloors and sheathing, with floor joists made of a      similar material. We found used glass for the living room      skylight and for the three elliptic eyebrow windows in the      gable ends. Most of the finished wood for the house's      interior is coming from various reclaimed woods -      heart pine, chestnut and oak - that Kip found and      stored over the years.    </p>    <p>      We will again have a wood cookstove as the kitchen's      centerpiece, but there also will be hot water baseboard      heat throughout the house. Kip designed the heat pipes to      run behind soapstone conductors, a combination that should      be both beautiful and warm. Eventually much of our hot      water will come from solar heat. The fireplace, and the      kitchen and bathroom counters and sinks all will be made      from soapstone. Not only are the multihued grays of the      stone beautiful, but soapstone is a nonconductive,      nonreactive medium that is perfect for hard use and for      thermal mass. Our eldest son, Kierk, owns New World Stone      Company, a source of Virginia soapstone for architectural,      landscaping and art use across the country.    </p>    <p>      It's been 30 years since either of us has lived where there      are streetlights or sidewalks. Oh, I lied. I did go away to      graduate school and live in student housing for a while. It      was fun to walk to the movies, or to get an ice-cream cone      whenever I wanted. But I was glad to return to our home      that lies 16 miles from town, just below the crest of      Shenandoah National Park, with the woods and the river      framing the sky.    </p>    <p>      So MOTHER, I got everything I asked for in my 1974 letter      - and far more than I ever could have imagined.    </p>
