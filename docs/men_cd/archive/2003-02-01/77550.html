                      <h5 id="byline">Edited by Carol Mack</h5>			    <h3>      Maritime Canada/New England    </h3>    <p>      Winter for the Northern gardener is a time to read the      catalogs and plan next spring's garden. Fruit trees can be      pruned from January at least until March. If you are going      to graft, cut scion wood now and wrap it in four or five      layers of plastic to store in the refrigerator. (The      plastic protects the wood from any ethylene gases emitted      by fruit in your refrigerator) Start early seedlings of      leeks, onions and celery; even peppers can be started in      late February. Wait until March for most other veggies.      Check the root cellar and pantry for spoilage in onions,      apples and squash. If there is a small problem, make soup.      If the problem is worse, consider freezing food before it      all rots.    </p>    <h3>      Mid-Atlantic    </h3>    <p>      Improve your germination rates by starting seeds in an      incubator. You can create a toasty, well-ventilated spot      using an old refrigerator, a shielded lightbulb and a small      fan powered through a thermostat set at 86 degrees. Use the      incubator to presprout radish, spinach, pea, carrot and      beet seeds on moist paper towels - then plant them      outside under row cover as soon as they send out their      first little roots. Start seed for transplants of bulb      onions, eggplant, broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce,      and some early tomatoes and peppers. Plant cool-weather      greens in a cold frame for a jump on the season. Try some      globe arti chokes in a cold frame, too - if exposed      to temperatures between 35 degrees and 42 degrees while      they are young, they often produce the same year. Plant      potatoes around St. Patrick's Day for high, early yields.    </p>    <h3>      Southern Interior    </h3>    <p>      February and March are transition months for Southern      gardeners. By now you've already planned out (or at least      thought about) your garden for the upcoming season. In      February, start warm-season crops (tomatoes, cucumbers,      peppers, eggplants, etc.) indoors to have healthy      transplants ready to plant after winter's last frost. Till      soil four to six weeks before transplanting. This also is a      great time to get your soil tested and add any nutrients it      might need. Other activities for these months include      pruning - especially roses (See " Pruning Made Easy      ," Page 78).    </p>    <h3>      Gulf Coast    </h3>    <p>      Garden fever starts early along the Gulf Coast. Our average      last frost is around mid-February, but often we can plant      tomato transplants in early February. A lot depends on how      many you are planting. If you're only setting out a dozen      plants, then take a chance - and keep the covers      handy. Wait until March to transplant cold-sensitive      eggplants and peppers. Plant a late crop of broccoli and      lettuce transplants in early February and sow fast-growing,      seeded crops like radishes, turnips and mustard. March      begins the hectic planting of warmseason crops like beans,      corn, cucumbers and melons, but whit until April to sow      hotweather crops like okra and southern peas. Apply a      dormant-oil spray to fruit trees early this season before      they begin to break dormancy. Don't forget the flower beds      - plant dahlias and gladiolas now. In March, plant      sunny beds with seed or transplants of marigolds, zinnias,      gomphrena and rudbeckia, and brighten shady spots with      impatiens and caladiums.    </p>    <h3>      Central/Midwest    </h3>    <p>      Spring is coming! Time to start many plants inside -      be sure that you are beginning with disease-free      conditions. Wash used trays and inserts, and fill with a      quality seed-starting medium. Peppers will not germinate      well at room temperature - keep them at a constant 80      degrees for best success. To avoid leggy plants, keep your      light source as close as possible to the seedlings. Wait      until the soil outside is workable and about 50 degrees to      seed some early flowers and greens. If you are itching to      plant outdoors, try using a cold frame or a minigreenhouse      tunnel to heat up a patch of soil.    </p>    <h3>      North Central & Rockies    </h3>    <p>      Sprinkle fireplace ashes on lingering snow to warm your      garden soil weeks early. After the soil warms to 40      degrees, begin planting frost-tolerant greens like arugula,      Chinese cabbage, cress, kale, mustard, bok choy and      spinach. To speed germination, cover with fabric row covers      or, if you are more ambitious, make a simple cold frame. I      (Bill McDorman) built one from a great set of plans found      in the book <em>Solar Gardening</em> by Leandre Poisson (on      MOTHER'S Bookshelf, Page 129). My community garden plot,      where I used the cold frame, was the only plot completely      green at the beginning of May. I was harvesting delicious      greens when most of the gardeners were showing up to plant      their first seeds. Don't rush the season when starting      tomato and pepper transplants. Small, vigorously growing      plants will surge ahead of stressed, larger ones.    </p>    <h3>      Pacific Northwest    </h3>    <p>      Time for green thumbs of the Pacific Northwest to come out      of hibernation. Garden peas and sweet peas can be planted      directly into the garden as early as mid-February. To give      the sweet peas a jump-start on the season, lightly scratch      the seed coat with sandpaper and soak the seed in water      overnight. Transplant or direct-seed lettuce, spinach,      mustard and other greens, protecting them with a cloche or      row cover. This is also the perfect time to start many      vegetable, herb and flower seeds indoors. Build a compost      sifter of hardware cloth nailed on a frame of 1x4-inch      boards and add the sifted "garden gold" to your soil mix      for flower and vegetable starts. This is a great way to      concentrate all the nutrients around the transplant roots      for season-long feeding. Cool-season cover crops will      nourish summer plantings if you sow them now and turn them      under in late May.    </p>    <h3>      Southwest    </h3>    <p>      In central California, we go through exceptional droughts      at least once every 10 years where, by law, we are forced      to stop watering the European turfgrass lawns for the      summer. They die, then everyone rolls out new turf when the      drought restrictions are lifted. Wouldn't it be better to      expect and prepare for future droughts with native plants      in our landscaping and thick mulch in our vegetable      gardens? One strategy is to plant vegetable varieties      adapted to growing in drought conditions, like tepary beans      from the Pimas of central Arizona and Hopi corn developed      to grow in sand dunes without irrigation. Hot peppers also      are a good choice. The beauty of growing a pepper crop in      these conditions is that the hot weather and lack of water      really help to develop the heat of the peppers.    </p><hr />    <p>      Our thanks to the following for their contributions to the      Almanac: <strong>Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds,</strong>      Waterville, Maine; <strong>Cricket Rakita, Southern      Exposure Seed Exchange,</strong> Mineral, Virginia;      <strong>Connie Dam-Byl, William Dam Seeds,</strong> Dundas,      Ontario; <strong>Matt Barthel, Seed Savers      Exchange,</strong> Decorah, Iowa; <strong>Bill McDorman,      Seeds Trust/High Altitude Gardens,</strong> Hailey, Idaho;      <strong>Josh Kirschenbaum, Territorial Seed      Company,</strong> Cottage Grove, Oregon; <strong>Rose Marie      Nichols McGee, Nichols Garden Nursery,</strong> Albany,      Oregon; <strong>Craig and Sue Dremann, Redwood City Seed      Co.,</strong> Redwood City, California; <strong>Dean      Lollis, Park Seed Co.,</strong> Greenwood, South Carolina;      <strong>William D.
