                      <h5 id="byline">        by Terry Krautwurst    </h5>        <p>You don't have to look far in nature to see that not just      good things come in small packages, but truly remarkable,      holy-smoke kinds of things. Take, for instance, those      diminutive little chickadees flitting about our winter bird      feeders.    </p>    <p>      At first, you might not think they're anything special.      Certainly, few North American birds are more common.      Black-capped chickadees live coast to coast throughout most      of the northern half of the contiguous United States, plus      much of Canada and Alaska. In the Midwest and the South,      where the black-capped's range ends, the look-alike (but      somewhat smaller) Carolina chickadee takes up residence.      The mountain chickadee, with masked-bandit face markings,      claims the West. Plus, three other chickadee species make      their homes in North America - the chestnut-backed      (Pacific Northwest), the Mexican (Southwest) and the boreal      (Far North).    </p>    <p>      But "common" hardly means "ordinary" in the case of      chickadees.    </p>    <h3>      BRRRRRRD, IT'S COLD!    </h3>    <p>      Your average chickadee, a fidgety puff of mostly feathers      and bone, weighs about one-half ounce. How do these tiny      birds routinely survive frigid days and freezing nights?    </p>        <p>      In autumn, chickadees, like other small birds, grow a      thicker coat more - small, downy feathers, with lots      of heat-trapping air spaces. By winter, the birds have      gained 25 percent more plumage. On a cold day, chickadees      fluff up these feathers to at least an inch. The result is      a downy ball of a bird, its spherical overcoat      astonishingly effective. At 10 degrees below zero, the      difference between a tiny chickadee's body temperature (108      degrees) and the outside air - just an inch of      insulating feathers away - is 118 degrees.    </p>    <p>      Of course, it takes quite a furnace to generate and      maintain the bird's high body temperature. Indeed, the      chickadee is a metabolic fireball. Its heart beats 500      times a minute - at rest. Given intense activity, the      rate doubles to 1,000 beats. Even when perched, the little      chickadee is never still, cocking its head, shifting its      feet. And beneath all those feathers, the bird continually      flexes its chest muscles, shivering to generate yet more      heat.    </p>    <h3>      NIGHT SHIFT    </h3>    <p>      Being all fired up is fine during the day when the sun is      up and there's food to be eaten. But come sundown every      winter day, the bird faces 12 or more foodless hours of      dark and cold. How does it cope? First, by holing up in a      tree cavity. Chickadees are the only birds besides      woodpeckers who excavate their own holes. A cavity just big      enough for one bird to cram its body and its fluffed      feathers into is perfect. Watch your bird feeders in the      morning for chickadees with rumpled tail feathers -      the result of a night spent in cozy quarters.    </p>    <p>      Even with the best shelter, a chickadee also must sustain      its inner fires through the night or perish. Chickadees      don't have a crop in their throats to store food that is      slowly digested while sleeping. Instead, they turn down      their internal thermostats, conserving energy and saving      fuel. They reduce their need for food and oxygen on cold      nights by going into a state of controlled hypothermia,      lowering their body temperature by as much as 20 degrees.    </p>    <h3>      BITTY BRAIN, MASSIVE MEMORY    </h3>    <p>      Regardless of the birds' nighttime energy efficiency,      during the day the tiny fliers must eat almost constantly      to feed their furnaces and put on enough surplus fat      - about 10 percent of their normal body weight      - to get them through another night.    </p>    <p>      Because they need a lot of food, especially when the days      shorten and sustenance becomes scarce, chickadees spend all      autumn gathering and storing food. Unlike many woodland      food hoarders, chickadees don't put most of their      provisions in large caches. Instead, they hide one or two      tidbits at a time in separate locations over a wide      territory. Biologists call this behavior "scatter      hoarding," which, they contend, ups the odds of survival.      If a competitor finds one stash, all is not lost -      there are many more scattered stockpiles.    </p>        <p>      So in fall, each chickadee works to fill its own      multi-acre, here-and-there food pantry. It readies insect      prey by plucking off the heads and wings, then stuffs the      bodies beneath bits of loose bark or inside curled leaves.      Tiny seeds are wedged beneath layers of lichen; pushed      between evergreen needle clusters; poked into the ground.      (You can witness this behavior at your own feeders during      autumn. After filling their bellies in the morning,      chickadees will spend the rest of the day shuttling      sunflower seeds to hiding places)    </p>    <p>      The sheer scale of the birds' winter food-preparation      activities is astonishing. Carolina chickadees and others      that live where winters are relatively mild may store      several hundred separate food items. Chickadees in the      North or in mountain regions will hide several      <em>thousand</em> tidbits in as many locations.    </p>    <p>      Even more remarkably, chickadees remember precisely where      they've stored all that food. Experts once thought the      birds retrieved stashed goodies more or less by chance. But      researchers have found the chickadee that hides a given      meal in a given place is the same chickadee that returns      - sometimes months later - to gobble it up.    </p>    <p>      How can a bird with such a small brain remember the precise      locations of so many food caches? If you've ever played the      game of Concentration - or simply tried to keep track      of where you put your car keys - you can begin to      appreciate the feat.    </p>    <p>      Chickadees grow fresher, better brains every autumn, when      they need the extra recall power. Old brain cells die off,      essentially wiping the slate clean, while new brain cells      generate rapidly to replace them. The hippocampus, the area      of the brain responsible for memory and spatial      relationships, becomes larger, giving the bird a greater      ability to mentally map its home territory and cache      locations. Later, in spring and summer when fresh food is      available, the bird's hippocampus shrinks to its normal      size.    </p>    <p>      So much for the notion of "bird brain." The chickadee's      renewable brain, with its ability to produce new neurons      each year when needed, then discard them when not, may      eventually point researchers toward better treatments of      Alzheimer's disease and other degenerative brain maladies.    </p>    <h3>      ALL IN THE FLOCK    </h3>    <p>      Like most birds, chickadees are monogamous. They live in      pairs during spring and summer, their breeding season. Each      couple claims and defends a territory of several acres.    </p>    <p>      But in fall, chickadees form winter flocks typically      containing six to 10 birds - usually with equal      numbers of males and females, which are paired. A flock      isn't a family, but a sort of neighborhood association of      chickadee couples. Within the flock, male chickadees rank      above female, older above younger. The top-ranked chickadee      - usually an elder male - gets to eat first at      a feeder, and can chase away any other flock member. The      second-ranked bird can lord it over all those below it, and      so on.    </p>    <p>      You can watch the chickadees' intriguing behaviors and      social dynamics in back yards across the country. I      confess, though, that what I most admire about chickadees      has little to do with natural science and more with sheer      pluck.    </p>    <p>      See for yourself some somber winter's day. Check out the      chickadees - ever busy, always chipper, in a colder,      harsher place than you, but making the best of it just the      same.    </p>    <p>      Amazing how such a little bird can lift our spirits.    </p>
