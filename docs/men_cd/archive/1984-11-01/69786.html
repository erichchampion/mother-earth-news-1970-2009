                <p>      Folks without greenhouses-even apartment dwellers-can enjoy      homegrown vegetables with . . .    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Charles G. Loeb Jr.    </h5>        <p>      Charles G. Loeb Jr. It's a typically bone-chilling winter      day in southern New York State, with the mercury huddled at      20°F and six feet of crusty snow on the ground. Yet      I've just picked some fresh Swiss chard for tonight's      dinner! In another day or so, I'll gather some kale. I      harvested tender, green broccoli a week ago, and-a few days      before that-picked brussels sprouts.<br />      <br />      No, I don't have a greenhouse, or even a cold frame. My      crops are all grown in containers. I start them in late      summer, let them reach maturity outdoors, then bring them      inside when frost threatens.<br />      <br />      The "green thumb bug" bit me a few years ago, when I first      experimented with indoor plantings of tomatoes and      cucumbers. Then in 19811 rented a warehouse for my      wholesale and mail-order spice business and decided to set      up a rather ambitious container garden on the piece of      asphalt pavement that came with the lease. During that      summer my wife and I savored tomatoes, zucchini, peas,      beans, kale, okra, chard, lettuce, and broccoli . . . all      from my 200-square-foot plot of pots.<br />      <br />      After the first hard frosts, I moved the remaining few      containers of kale to the attic. I didn't really expect the      plants to survive, because the single, east-facing window      there receives only three to four hours of sunlight (when      there is any) during the short days of fall and winter.      Moreover, since I only use the warehouse for a few hours      each week, I keep the temperature there below      50°F.<br />      <br />      I was flabbergasted, therefore, at seeing how the kale      flourished. My family ate one plant in January and another      in February, and-later that month-I put the remaining two      back outside. They seemed to almost spread their leaves to      the cool late-winter sunshine and, in early April, yielded      a bumper crop of greens.<br />      <br />      With that experience behind me, I decidedin the spring of      1983-to plant enough containers to provide my family with      fresh vegetables at least once a week through the cold      months and early spring. Although I concentrated on crops      that would grow back after harvesting (chard, kale, and      broccoli), I also planted brussels sprouts and cabbage      (which store well) and two varieties of lettuce. All in      all, I put in about 60 plants, staggering the sowings so      that each vegetable would be fully grown by October      1.<br />      <br />      We had an unusually mild fall, and Jack Frost didn't move      in until mid-December . . . but when he came around, he      seemed determined to make up for lost time! Like much of      the rest of the country, we had the coldest Christmas on      record. By then, of course, my plants were safely upstairs.      I put shelves across the window and placed the best      specimens on them, to make the most of whatever sun we were      blessed with. I arranged the rest' of the plants on the      floor . . . where they had to settle for a thin ray of      light that made a slow arc from 8:00 AM until noon. (During      the late afternoon, I actually had to turn on a light to      <em>find</em> anything in the 60-square-foot attic.)<br />      <br />      Even so, our nine chard plants were very productive, and we      ate their greens once a week. By February, the leaves were      small, but new growth continued. If anything, the baby      shoots were more tender and tasty than the early pickings.      The 30 regular kale plants and the five of the flowering      types (which are as tasty <em>and</em> more colorful than      the standard kind) also produced weekly harvests right up      until I was able to pick outdoor crops in the early      spring.<br />      <br />      The broccoli, too, was a delightful surprise. Each of the      ten plants produced scores of small but delectable sprouts.      However, there weren't quite enough for a full meal at each      picking, so this winter I'll plant more. The three cabbage      plants weren't expected to grow inside, and they didn't.      But one small head made some delicious cole slaw, and the      other two, which were put outside in early spring, were      ready to pick in just a few weeks. My five brussels sprout      plants were harvested by late January.</p>      <h3>CONTAINER PLANTING TIPS</h3>      <p>      In the course of my experiments with winter container      gardening, I've picked up some general knowledge that I      would like to pass on.<br />      <br />      <strong>Pots:</strong> Almost anything will do, from      plastic milk containers to redwood planters, as long as      they're big enough and have drainage holes in the bottom.      However, I prefer plastic pots that are squared off at the      bottom to allow the plant roots to spread. These are also      lighter than clay pots (you may be moving them a lot), and      they do a better job of reducing evaporation. Containers 8"      to 11 " in diameter-which can be purchased from most garden      supply stores for about $1.25 to $2.00 - proved to be      adequate for all the types of produce I've grown so      far.<br />      <br />      <strong>Soil:</strong> I use regular potting soil, which      costs about $3.00 for 40 pounds and can be used over and      over again as long as a good fertilizer is applied at      regular intervals. Each 11 " pot for broccoli needs about      20 pounds of soil. The other plants can be grown in smaller      containers. (You could also, of course, mix your own      potting medium . . . recipes can be found in many garden      books.)<br />      <br />      <strong>Watering:</strong> When outside in the summer,      container-grown plants generally need water at least once a      day. I don't use saucers outdoors, but they're essential      indoors to protect your floors. In winter, a soaking every      week or so is usually enough . . . but do check your plants      more often than that. If they feel dry, douse them. Mature      vegetables tend to get thirsty, and they won't suffer if      they have "wet feet."<br />      <br />      <strong>Fertilizing:</strong> Generally speaking, you will      have to feed your pot-grown vegetables more often than you      would garden plants, because the frequent watering washes      away the nutrients. If you use a fertilizer that must be      scratched into the dirt, be careful not to damage your      plants' roots. If they become exposed, sprinkle the      fertilizer over the surface and then cover it with more      potting soil. Feeding should be done every week or biweekly      while the plants are outside, but it can be discontinued      during the winter.<br />      <br />      <strong>Sunlight:</strong> Leafy crops need at least six      hours of sunlight in the summer, and flowering plants      should have two or three hours more. If one location isn't      bright enough, simply move the pots to follow the sun. Once      they're mature and indoors, though, this factor isn't as      critical. They'll pretty much make do with what's available      until you're ready to harvest.    </p>    <h3>      A CROP-BY-CROP GUIDE    </h3>        <p>      <strong>Swiss Chard:</strong> This superproductive green      just doesn't know when to quit! It's the only vegetable      that grows equally well in cool or hot weather. I'm now      eating chard that I started in April, and it's just as      flavorful as the small sowing I made in August. I've had      best results with Lucullus Light Green (available from      George W. Park Seed Company, Box 31, Greenwood, SC 29647,      and other companies). There's another fine variety, Rhubarb      Chard, that has red veins and stems and makes an attractive      companion to the green species. If you plant chard in an 8"      pot around the end of July and keep the leaves picked      before they reach 15" in length, you'll be rewarded with      copious production. Fifteen plants are more than enough to      allow a family of four to dine on this delicacy about once      a week. Chard is tolerant of light frost, but why take a      chance? Bring it inside when the season's first freeze is      predicted.<br />      <br />      <strong>Kale:</strong> "What is it?" and "Can you eat it?"      are the typical questions visitors ask when they first see      my spectacular flowering kale. This showpiece vegetable      would be a standout in any ornamental garden, yet it's just      as tasty as regular kale.<br />      <br />      It forms a tight head with a creamy white center that's      surrounded by less compact, green outer leaves. There's      another variety that's red-on-green (Frizzy Red, from      Park). I think these plants are too pretty to disfigure by      partial picking, but when each full head is harvested,      it'll provide up to four portions. I also grow the standard      kale, which continues producing after the outer leaves have      been cut. Kale should be grown in 6" to 8" pots and started      in mid-July. The cool fall weather brings out the color,      and the vegetable actually needs several nights of frost to      make it sweet. In fact, it's one of the most frosttolerant      of vegetables.<br />      <br />      <strong>Broccoli:</strong> The sprouting types are the most      prolific. After producing small main heads, they'll send      out side shoots over a long period of time. These get      smaller following each picking, but their taste sure holds      up! I'd recommend Green Goliath from Burpee (W. Atlee      Burpee Company, 300 Park Ave., Warminster, PA 18991). But      remember that, because broccoli has deep roots, it will      require a big 11" pot. I sow my winter crop in midJuly and      have found that broccoli can take some frost.<br />      <br />      <strong>Lettuce:</strong> I'm partial to Park's Mission,      which has a head that doesn't always form up if planted in      mid-July for winter pickings. Even so, it's just as good as      any loose-leaf lettuce I've ever grown. In addition, I grow      Bibb, which has small but sweet heads. Since lettuce roots      are shallow, a 6° pot is fine. I don't risk any frost      with lettuce. Even in the protection of the attic, the      outer leaves tended to turn brown, but we were still able      to have fresh salads through most of January.<br />      <br />      <strong>Cabbage:</strong> 1983 saw my first attempt at      growing this vegetable. I was given some seeds but didn't      learn what variety they were. This season, I'm      experimenting with Park's Darkri, a fast-growing,      medium-heading variety. Last year I started cabbage in      mid-July in 8" pots. The plants seemed to hold up nicely      indoors.<br />      <br />      <strong>Brussels sprouts:</strong> Like kale, these      minicabbages taste sweeter after a few nights of frost.      Sprouts require a long growing season and should be started      early in July. My 19831984 choice was Burpee's Long Island      Improved, which yielded a profusion of sweet, tender-but      only marble-size-sprouts, which we were able to enjoy until      the end of February. A friend at the New York Horticultural      Society suggested that the stunted size of the sprouts      probably resulted from the unusual sustained heat our part      of the country suffered during the outdoor growing season.      For the winter of 84/85, I'm trying jade Cross E Hybrid      from Burpee, which should yield bigger heads.<br />      <br />      <strong>INDOOR FARMING</strong> <strong>FOR      HOMEOWNERS</strong><br />      <br />      The light and heat in my warehouse attic (and the absence      of available space in my apartment) limit the varieties of      crops that I can grow. But homeowners-even those who can't      install greenhouses-can combine artificial lights with      higher indoor temperatures to insure fine harvests in      attics, basements, or spare rooms. After all, there's no      spacing problem with containers. Just put the pots side by      side, touching one another. And, especially if you have      shelves, a surprising number of plants can be placed in a      relatively small area to yield a greater bounty per square      foot than many outdoor gardens.<br />      <br />      Whether your harvest is large or small, though, you'll be      sure to welcome the marvelous taste, nutrition, and      freshness your homegrown produce will provide. You'll      experience the fun and satisfaction of being just a bit      more self-sufficient, too.    </p>
