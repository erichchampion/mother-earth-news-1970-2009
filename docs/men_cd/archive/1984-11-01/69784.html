                <p>      If you'd rather burn the smoke from your stove than clean      it from your chimney, look into . . .    </p>        <p>      In the last issue of MOTHER, we reviewed the progress      that's being made toward developing clean-burning,      efficient wood stoves. The latest high-tech wood burners      use 30% less wood and emit up to 90% fewer pollutants than      did the best heaters built only five years ago. However, a      lot of us simply don't <em>have</em> roughly $1,000 to lay      out for the latest catalytic-converter-equipped wood      stove.<br />      <br />      Luckily, there is a course of action available that's a      great deal more affordable than purchasing a complete new      wood stove <em>and</em> that still provides much of the      efficiency improvement and emissions reduction made      possible by these state-of-the-art combustors. There are,      you see, over a half-dozen catalytic retrofit devices on      the market today, and test results show that they offer      significant performance gains over a plain old airtight      heater. If you're in the market for such a device, here are      some of the things to look for.<br />      <br />      Any retrofit catalyst is a compromise, because the stove      that it's installed in was not designed to insure an      adequate supply of oxygen and good mixing of the smoke and      oxygen at the combustor. Also, add-on catalysts are often      positioned farther from active flames than are designed-in      units, so the temperature of gases entering them is      generally lower. This means that the add-on (and      particularly the external) catalyst may be reluctant to      "light off" at the beginning of a burn or after      refueling.<br />      <br />      Catalyst retrofits that are positioned inside the firebox      offer some obvious advantages. (MOTHER presented plans for      a build-ityourself model on page 162 of issue 79; see page      128 for back issue ordering information.) Their close      proximity to the burn zone allows them to get into action      early and keep working until there's little left but coals.      Having the unit too close to the fire can, however, be a      liability. If adequate precautions aren't taken to prevent      flames from reaching the ceramic monolith, thermal shock      can quickly destroy the catalyst: There have been reports      of combustors that disintegrated after only a few months'      use in stoves designed without adequate flame impingement      protection. Internal combustors are probably best suited to      stoves that are used continuously at low to medium heat      outputs.<br />      <br />      Many designers, including Robert Vincelwho developed the      Riteway internal'and the Uni-Com external catalyst      retrofits-have concluded that the stress to the combustor      inside a stove isn't generally worth the gains provided by      that position. Vincel's Uni-Com uses elaborate mixing      geometry to insure good distribution of gases, and is      fitted with cast refractory to give the unit thermal mass.      The latter measure helps the combustor get through      transient cool conditions-such as occur during      reloading-without dropping below ignition      temperature.<br />      <br />      Tests have been done on three retrofit cat alysts by      Shelton Energy Research for the New York State Energy      Research and Development Authority. The evaluation was      limited to one stove design, and Jay Shelton suggests that      the numbers shown in the accompanying chart could have been      different if a variety of appliances had been used.      Specifically, some retrofits add secondary air to insure      good oxygenation. This could be an advantage on some      heaters and a disadvantage on others. Some combustors are      longer than others, and the extra length could improve      performance on larger stoves with high flue gas velocities.      Furthermore, a number of add-ons are also restrictive (that      is, they slow the exhaust gases and reduce the maximum burn      rate), which may provide better heat transfer in stoves      that are leaky. (Restrictions may also protect the      combustor by preventing high burn rates and attendant flame      impingement.)<br />      <br />      But, whether you choose an internal or external catalyst      retrofit, there are operating techniques that can help you      get the most out of the device. Catalysts thrive on just      those conditions that tend to plug the chimneys of      conventional airtights with creosote. Once the catalyst has      gone into action, it will work best when the firebox is      loaded with fuel, the air controls are adjusted for a low      burn, and the fire is allowed to smolder. In fact, those of      us at MOTHER who use catalyst stoves have found that little      attention needs to be paid to the heater's operation. A      typical day consists of jamming the firebox full first      thing in the morning and again before going to bed. A      12-hour burn is within easy reach, and the heat output      remains quite stable over that period.<br />      <br />      Unfortunately, there's only one way to be absolutely sure      that the catalyst is working. Despite all the      advertisements that show the combustor glowing, this      situation only occurs for, at most, a couple of hours      during the burn cycle; most of the time, the catalyst is      working just fine without emitting any visible radiation.      Only a dual-probe thermometer, with one sensor before the      combustor and one after, will show with assurance whether      gases are being burned in the catalyst. (Companies that      market such devices include Vermont Technology Group, Inc.,      Morrisville, VT 05661, and Lehman Engineering, P.O. Box      487, Mazomanie, WI 53560.) A surface thermometer will give      you a general idea of whether the combustor is generating      heat, but will give little clue to the combustor's overall      effectiveness. Of course, a reduction in the amount of      smoke coming from the chimney is a general indicator of      combustor light-off, and heavy build-up of black, shiny or      gooey creosote (rather than tan or brown soot) is a sure      sign that the catalyst hasn't been working for some time.      Don't assume, however, that a properly operating catalytic      converter <em>will eliminate</em> creosote. Some material      will still accumulate, and chimney maintenance should be a      regular part of your routine.<br />      <br />      The list of manufacturers of retrofit catalytic converters      that accompanies this article includes most, if not all, of      the devices that are presently available for universal      application. Many stove manufacturers make kits designed      specifically for their products (Riteway is one company      that offers such a device), and you should check first with      the local dealer who handles your brand of heater. Then, if      that fails, consider a universal retrofit. You won't regret      it!    </p>        <p>      Applied Ceramics Versagrid<br />      P.O.
