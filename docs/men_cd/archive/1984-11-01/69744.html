                    <h5 id="byline">By Bonnie Mandoe</h5>    <p>      Last year our family decided to bake, rather than buy,      gifts for our friends and relatives. And we discovered that      simple ingredients, willing hands, basic kitchen equipment,      and several hours' time are all it takes to make a satchel      of gifts Santa would be <em>proud</em> to deliver.      Furthermore, the gift-making process turned out to be more      fun than shopping had ever been, and our presents were well      received . . . in fact, you might say the folks who got      them really <em>ate them up!</em><br />      <br />      I began our project by assembling three of our family's      best-loved holiday recipes. <em>Julekaqe</em> is a rich,      cardamom-flavored bread that's traditionally served on      Christmas morning in Denmark, my husband's native country.      The children's favorite was next: crisp gingerbread      cookies. (I had redesigned the recipe to include only whole      grains and unrefined sweeteners.) The third is a festive      nutty and fruity granola that's as delicious for snacking      as it is for breakfast. This trio of recipes yielded 20      generous and very tasty gifts, and filled the <em>home</em>      pantry as well. The total cost of the ingredients, at      current prices in our area, is less than $60. With simple      and attractive packaging, then, your gifts could cost less      than $4 apiece!<br />      <br />      <strong>JULEKAGE</strong><br />      <br />      This recipe is huge (it'll make 10 loaves!), so you might      prefer to halve it for easier handling.<br />      <br />      1 cup of warm water<br />      3 cups of warm milk<br />      3 tablespoons of ground cardamom<br />      2 large cans (13 ounces each) of evaporated milk,      warmed<br />      3 cups of currants<br />      1/4 cup of honey<br />      6 tablespoons of active dry yeast<br />      6 cups of whole wheat bread flour<br />      1 teaspoons of salt<br />      1 cup of melted margarine or butter<br />      2 cups of honey<br />      6 beaten eggs<br />      12 cups of whole wheat bread flour (more or less)<br />      <br />      In a very large bowl-of <em>at least</em> 2-gallon      capacity-combine the water, milk, cardamom,      evaporated milk, currants, and 1/4 cup of honey. Sprinkle      yeast over the surface and allow it to activate for 10      minutes or until bubbly. Then beat in 6 cups of whole wheat      flour, giving it 300 vigorous strokes. Set the bowl in a      warm place to let the mixture rise for 15-30 minutes, then      whip in the salt, margarine or butter, 2 cups of honey, and      the beaten eggs. Stir in more flour by the cupful until the      dough is too stif to beat any more, then turn it out onto a      floured board and knead for 15-20 minutes, or until the      dough's smooth and no longer sticky. Lightly oil the      surface of the bread-to-be; and place it in a large, clean,      oiled bowl-covered with a clean, damp towel-to      rise until it has doubled . . . usually about 90 minutes.      Punch it down (that is, sock it energetically about 25      times) and let it rise again until doubled (about 45      minutes, this time).<br />      <br />      To make loaves, first divide the dough into ten equal      pieces. Lay all but one aside, covering them with a damp      towel. Then divide the remaining loaf into three equal      pieces, roll each piece into a thin strip, and braid the      three together. Do the same with each of the remaining nine      lumps of dough. Now, place the shaped loaves on greased      cookie sheets or in bread pans. Brush the surface of the      loaves with the gently beaten whites of 2 eggs.<br />      <br />      <em>[EDITORS NOTE: Brushing with milk will also produce a      lovely glazed crust]</em> Allow the loaves to rise for      about 20 minutes, or until they're about 2/3 doubled, then      bake them for 35-50 minutes at 350°F. (Baking time will      depend on the shape of the loaves: Braids are done in 35      minutes, but loaf shapes take longer.) Unless you have a      perfect oven, you'll need to rotate the breads from the      oven's top to bottom shelves alter 20 minutes or so in      order to have them brown evenly. When finished, the breads      will sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Lay them on      racks or prop them up against bread pans to cool. Wrap them      only when they are absolutely cool.    </p>        <p>      <strong>NUTTY AND FRUITY GRANOLA</strong><br />      <br />      This recipe makes something over two gallons of granola (I      separate it into about 10 gift bags), so be sure you have a      huge pot or bowl for mixing the following      ingredients:<br />      <br />      <em>1</em> 8 cups of rolled oats<br />      4 cups of sunflower seeds<br />      2 cups each of pumpkin seeds and raw, unsalted      peanuts<br />      1 cup each of chopped cashews, almonds, walnuts, and      filberts<br />      1 cup each of wheat germ and wheat bran<br />      1 cups of shredded, unsweetened coconut<br />      3 cups of honey<br />      1 cup of safflower or corn oil<br />      1 cup of melted butter or margarine<br />      1 tablespoon of vanilla<br />      2 cups each of raisins and chopped, pitted dates<br />      <br />      Mix together all the dry ingredients except the dates and      raisins, then heat the honey, oil, butter, and vanilla      until they're well warmed and blended. With that done, pour      the honey mixture over the dry ingredients and mix      thoroughly. Now spread the granola evenly over cookie      sheets or into roasting pans. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: When      testing this recipe, MOTHER's baker used eight cookie      sheets.]</em> The thinner the granola is spread, the      quicker it will cook . . . which means it needs to be      watched carefully lest it burn. Stir the mix      frequently-every 3 minutes-while it bakes for      about <em>20-30</em> minutes in a 300°F oven. Rotate      the pans from the upper to the lower shelves to ensure even      browning.<br />      <br />      Remove the browned granola to a large bowl or bin for      cooling (it becomes crisp when completely cool). Finally,      mix in the raisins and dates, then package the cereal in      snaplock bags . . . leaving some for Christmas      munching!<br />      <br />      <strong>GINGERBREAD GOODIES</strong><br />      <br />      Depending upon which cookie cutter I use, I can get      <em>3-1/2</em> dozen large "people" or 10 dozen smaller      cookies from this particular recipe.<br />      <br />      5-3/4-6 cups of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1 /3 teaspoon <em>each</em> of cinnamon and cloves<br />      1-1/4 teaspoons of ginger<br />      2 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      1 cup of butter or margarine<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      1/2 cup of molasses (for stronger flavor and additional      nutrition, use blackstrap molasses)<br />      1 tablespoon of vinegar<br />      1 large egg, beaten<br />      chopped nuts, candies, or currants<br />      <br />      Sift together the dry ingredients. Then, in a saucepan,      melt the butter and add the honey, molasses, and vinegar,      heating until bubbly. Cool the honey mixture and add it,      together with the beaten egg, to the dry ingredients. Beat      this batter well and chill it for at least <em>2</em> hours      (the mixture will be sticky). When the dough is thoroughly      chilled, divide it into roughly 8 sections. To make thin,      crisp cookies, roll one section at a time to about 1/16".      If you'd prefer chewy cookies, roll the sections to about      1/16". Cut shapes with the cookie cutters-or      freehand, if you prefer, using a sharp knife. Decorate your      creations with chopped nuts, candies, or currants, and      place them-nearly touching-on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake      for 10-15 minutes at 350°F, watching carefully to see      that they don't burn. Finally, remove the finished cookies      to cooling racks, and package them in tins when they're      thoroughly cool.</p><p> * * * </p><p>This year we're again looking      forward to our baking session with enthusiasm. There's a      special quality to home-cooked gifts, still fragrant from      the oven and decorated with real ribbons. And mixed with      the ingredients in these gifts is something of the      earth-from whose bounty came the grains-and      something of our own love and labor . . . all blended into      an offering to nourish both the body arid the spirit.    </p>
