                <p>      <em>"The mistletoe hung in the castle hall,/The holly      branch shone on the old oak wall;/The baron's retainers      were blithe and gay/a-keeping a Christmas holiday." (Thomas      H. Bayley)</em>    </p>              <p>      The familiar glossy, spiked leaves and brilliant red      berries of the holly are closely linked with our      traditional Christmas celebration. Yet, the use of holly,      mistletoe, and other holiday evergreens actually originated      in pagan rituals that date back long before the advent of      Christianity. The druids of ancient Britian held the holly      tree sacred and decorated their homes with it . . . the      early Teutons hung sprigs of holly in their dwellings in      hopes that the friendlier fairies of the forest might find      refuge there from the winter's chill . . . and in Roman      times, holly was used in the celebration of the Saturnalia,      or "turning of the sun" festival honoring Saturn (the god      of seedtime), which was held on the winter solstice. At      that time of year, when the days were shortest, it was      customary to send gifts accompanied by holly boughs to      friends as signs of goodwill. Many of these customs were      adopted by the early Christian church, and so became      associated with the Christmas celebration.<br />      <br />      Today, many folks-realizing that holly is too      beautiful to enjoy only once a year-are discovering      that growing this "holiday" tree year-round can be an easy      and <em>profitable</em> means of brightening up the home      landscape. Hollies are versatile ornamentals, magnificent      as single trees, in hedges and screens, or-in the      dwarf forms-as ground covers. The hollies serve an      important function in environmental plantings, too, since      they're extremely tolerant of air pollutants, act as      excellent sound and light barriers, and attract birds and      animals that feed on the fruits and leaves. What's more,      many species of hollies can earn their keep! If you time      the shrubs' annual pruning to coincide with the Christmas      season, even small plantings of holly can supply you with a      handsome holiday cash crop (or, at least, free decorations)      of trimmed greens and berried boughs.<br />      <br />      <strong>TYPES OF HOLLIES</strong><br />      <br />      The name <em>holly</em> generally brings to mind the      glossy-leaved, red-berried English and American species.      But there are many other species, some of which look quite      different from the more familiar types. In fact, although      the English holly-a British import that has become      acclimated to parts of the U.S., particularly the Pacific      Northwest-still reigns supreme in the      <em>commercial</em> Christmas holly market, more and more      people are finding that the <em>native</em> North American      hollies, both the evergreen and deciduous species, can      provide equally attractive home decorations and landscape      plantings. And because many of the indigenous species have      the added bonus of increased winter hardiness, they can be      grown over a much wider range.<br />      <br />      About 40 of the more than 300 known species of hollies will      grow in the United States (about half of those are native      to this continent), and hundreds of cultivars of these      species are available. The variability among the species is      quite extensive: Some plants may reach as high as 70 feet,      while others may grow no more than 12 inches tall. The      leaves may be spiny or smooth-edged, and (as noted above)      there are deciduous as well as evergreen varieties. The      berries may be red, yellow, orange, white, or even black.      What's more, not all hollies even <em>have</em> berries. In      most species the male and female flowers are borne on      separate plants, with only the females bearing fruit. These      American-grown hollies can be classed into six major      groups: English, American, Chinese, Japanese, miscellaneous      evergreen, and deciduous.<br />      <br />      English holly <em>(Ilex aquifolium),</em> with its glossy,      dark green or variegated foliage and its brilliant red (or,      less commonly, yellow) berries, is considered by many      gardeners to be the most beautiful. Although the English      hollies actually comprise only one species, so many      cultivars have been developed that a number of the hybrids      are now often referred to separately as I. x      <em>altaclarensis.</em> This import favors the climate of      the Pacific Northwest (where the plant will often reach      heights of 70 feet), but many of the cultivars adapt well      to East Coast growing conditions, too.<br />      <br />      Anyone who has wandered in the fields and woodlands of the      southeastern U.S. is no doubt familiar with the glossy      leaves and gleaming berries of the broad-shaped American      holly, I. opaca. This species is native to the eastern and      gulf coasts, but has become adapted to the Midwest and even      parts of<br />      <br />      New England. The American holly is most at home in rich,      swampy lowlands (where it may reach heights of 50 feet or      more), yet it will also grow in the mountains. Although      most of the cultivars have spiny, olive green leaves and      red berries, some forms have smooth-edged foliage and      yellow fruits.<br />      <br />      The Chinese holly <em>(I cornuta) is</em> native to the      hilly regions bordering the Yangtze River. In the U.S., its      cultivars range from dwarf forms to shrubs or compact trees      up to 30 feet tall. The glossy, dark green foliage and      large, showy, bright red berries of the Chinese holly make      it an unusually attractive garden plant. Cultivars are      available with spiny or smooth leaves; some have yellow or      orange fruit.<br />      <br />      The Japanese holly <em>(I crenata) is</em> often referred      to as the workhorse of landscape gardening, but because it      has small, dark green leaves (like those of boxwood) and      jet black berries, many folks don't recognize it as a      holly. The many cultivars offer a wide variety of      applications, including ground covers and tall hedges . . .      and because some Japanese hollies are quite winter-hardy,      the plant is suited to northern and midwestern gardens as      well as those in the South and on the West Coast.<br />      <br />      There are a number of other evergreen hollies that are      native to this country and that deserve greater recognition      as ornamentals. The black-fruited inkberry <em>(I      glabra)</em> is the most abundant and most cold-resistant      of the native American hollies, and these traits make it      especially attractive to northern gardeners. Another      black-fruited species, the large gallberry <em>(I      coriacea),</em> is similar in appearance to the inkberry      but prefers the warmer climate of the southern coastal      plains. Also indigenous to the southern sand dunes is the      yaupon holly <em>(I vomitoria),</em> a highly regarded      ornamental species that's well suited to formal shapings      and hedge use. A number of cultivars of the yaupon holly      are available, including dwarf and tree specimens, and      fruiting (with bright red-or yellow-berries) and      nonfruiting varieties. The dark green leaves and red      berries of the dahoon holly <em>(I cassine)</em> are      similar to those of the American holly. This native      southern species grows farther south than any of the other      endemic red-fruited evergreen hollies. Hybrids between I.      <em>cassine</em> and I. <em>opaca</em> are known as the      Foster hybrids and are popular as ornamentals.<br />      <br />      The final category of hollies, the native      <em>deciduous</em> species, is by far the least      appreciated. In the northernmost areas of the country,      where evergreen hollies are not hardy, the deciduous types      display their bare branches laden with brilliant red jewels      throughout the winter months . . . while in the summer,      their vibrant greenery serves well in both ornamental      shrubs and hedges.<br />      <br />      Probably the best known of the deciduous hollies is the      winterberry <em>(I verticillata),</em> which is also called      the black alder. This widespread species is found in      swamplands all along the eastern coast but will adapt to      drier soils when cultivated as a landscape shrub. It      generally grows no larger than a small tree and produces      waxy red-or, rarely, yellow-fruits at      Christmastime. Other deciduous hollies include the      possumhaw <em>(I decidua),</em> a widespread southern      species that is a small shrub with dull green leaves and      glossy orangered or, sometimes, yellow berries . . . and      the mountain holly <em>(I ambigua var. montana),</em> which      is found in both the North and the South and is similar to      the possumhaw but has bigger leaves and large bright red      fruits.<br />      <br />      <strong>SELECTION SPECIFICS</strong><br />      <br />      When choosing hollies for your homestead collection, keep      in mind the different climatic preferences of the various      species. In general, evergreen hollies will do well in      regions of moderate temperatures, while the deciduous      species will tolerate harsher conditions. In areas where      the hardiness of an evergreen species is doubtful, pay      close attention to the microclimate in which the shrubs      will be planted. Which side of a building the plants are      located on, for example, might make a considerable      difference in how they fare during the colder months.      Choose a wintershaded site, so that the hollies won't be      exposed to the morning sunshine, and make sure they'll have      protection from the wind. As an added measure, mulch the      plants heavily in the late fall to protect the roots from      alternate freezing and thawing.<br />      <br />      Another consideration when choosing your holly trees,      <em>especially</em> if you intend to plant a small grove      with the idea of bringing in extra cash from the Christmas      prunings, is marketability. If you decide to plant a few      English hollies, for instance, select a mixture of green      and variegated specimens. Check with local nurseries and      your county agricultural extension agent to determine the      most salable and adaptable cultivars for your area.<br />      <br />      Finally, keep in mind that most holly species are      dioecious, meaning that both male and female plants must be      present to induce fruiting. The general rule is to plant      one male, or staminate, tree within 100 feet of every ten      pistillate trees to insure adequate pollination.<br />      <br />      <strong>PLANTING POINTERS</strong><br />      <br />      Next to selecting varieties that are appropriate to your      climate and landscaping needs, the most important concern      is supplying the plants with an adequate growing medium.      All hollies develop best in well-drained (but not dry),      fertile, light loamy soil that has a neutral or slightly      acid pH. Be sure to allow sufficient room for the      full-grown plant, too (unless you're planning to trim the      trees into a hedge), as many hollies require a good deal of      space to develop. Tree-type species are best spaced about      25 feet apart, which-in an orchard      situation-equals roughly 70 trees per acre.<br />      <br />      The best time to plant hollies is during the dormant      season, which in most areas is in the early spring, before      any new growth appears. However, in regions that have mild      winters, such as the South, transplanting can also be done      successfully in the late fall.<br />      <br />      It's generally recommended that you buy your plants from a      nursery, as transplanting hollies from the woods is often      unsuccessful unless specific procedures are followed.      Because hollies take a number of years before they fruit,      it's impossible to be certain of the sex of small wild      trees. And, of course, if you're seeking a specific      cultivar, you'll <em>have</em> to purchase it from a      nursery.<br />      <br />      However, it is possible-with the proper care-to      successfully relocate a wild tree (assuming that there is      no local law that forbids the transplanting of native      hollies). If you'd like a berried specimen, select an      already fruiting tree so that you'll be certain of its sex.      Then, because hollies don't begin to bear until they're      quite developed, you'll need to take considerable care in      freeing the tree's roots. Prepare such specimens a year or      two in advance by digging a trench, some distance from the      trunk and deep enough to cut through most of the roots,      during the tree's dormant period. Then pack the ditch with      good soil. If the holly is large, it's best to take two      years to prepare for the move, trenching halfway around the      tree one year and digging on the remaining side the next. A      new root system will develop in the filled-in trench,      giving the transplanted tree functioning roots close to its      trunk. Just before digging the holly, prune the top back      sufficiently to compensate for the inevitable loss of some      of its root system during the move (removing one-fourth of      the foliage is usually about right). Then, after digging,      wrap the trunk and branches in a two-inch-thick (or more)      moisture-retaining covering-such as burlap or sphagnum      moss-and water the bundle thoroughly. When      transplanting either wild or nursery-grown trees, it's      imperative that the trunk, roots, and branches remain moist      throughout the move <em>and</em> until new growth appears      after planting.<br />      <br />      Prepare the ground for your new arrival by digging a hole      twice the size of the root ball and refilling it to half      its depth with good soil. If the natural earth is clayey,      break up the soil at the bottom of the hole with a spading      fork and mix in generous amounts of sand and organic      matter. Then tamp the soil in the hole to provide a firm      base for the tree.<br />      <br />      Nursery-grown hollies are sold either balled-and-burlapped      or in containers. Burlap-wrapped roots can be set "as is"      in the hole, but the container should be cut away from      "canned" specimens. Set the plant in the hole and pack good      soil around it, leaving a slight surface basin to hold      water. Stake the plant if needed, and if the transplant has      not already been pruned, cut it back at this time. Then      water the holly thoroughly.<br />      <br />      After planting, mulch the base of the tree with a three- to      four-inch-deep layer of leaf mold or similar material to      help retain the moisture in the soil and to reduce weed      growth (because hollies have such shallow roots, the soil      around them should never be cultivated). Then keep an eye      on the weather, and if the rainfall is insufficient to keep      the roots moist, drench the plant at weekly intervals,      especially during its first few seasons of growth.<br />      <br />      <strong>CARING FOR THE CROP</strong><br />      <br />      Hollies demand little care once they're established, but      they do appreciate an annual dose of fertilizer, especially      if they're expected to supply cut greens every year. For      trees with one-half-inch-diameter (or less) trunks, apply      half a pound of fertilizer with an 8 to 10% nitrogen      content or surface-dress the plants with a liberal amount      of rotted manure in the early spring. Larger trees require      one to two pounds of fertilizer (or the equivalent) for      each inch of trunk diameter.<br />      <br />      Most hollies are fairly resistant to pests and disease,      although the genus as a whole is subject to quite a few      ailments. The most aggravating holly pest is the leaf      miner, which tunnels through the inner tissues of the      foliage and disfigures the leaves. Other pests and diseases      include scale insects, red spider mites, aphids, mealybugs,      root nematodes, and various fungi and molds. If a disease      or pest proves troublesome, contact your local agricultural      extension agent for information about the appropriate      controls for your area.<br />      <br />      In most cases, however, poor performance is caused, not by      pests or disease, but by choosing an unsuitable variety for      your climate, improperly transplanting the tree, alternate      freezing and thawing of the shallow roots, or inadequate      moisture. Much of the damage incurred from disease and      insects can be prevented by giving the holly plenty of      growing room and pruning injured or crowded branches.<br />      <br />      Other than fertilizing your plants and keeping an eye out      for pests, care for your holly crop will be minimal.      Although pruning is sometimes needed when the plants are      young to help them develop a leader shoot, the larger      specimens are generally left to develop their natural form      on their own, and-at most-are shaped just once      a year, generally during the holiday season. If you've      planted your hollies with the intention of harvesting the      greens, this is when you'll reap the returns of your      labor.<br />      <br />      It usually takes five to eight years from the time the      hollies are planted before they'll begin to "pay out" in      greenery. The first trimmings should be limited to five to      ten pounds per tree, then increased each year until you're      harvesting from 10 to 20 pounds per tree after about the      tenth season. After 15 years of growth, you can expect      hollies to produce as much as 25 pounds of greenery per      tree, depending, of course, on the variety you've planted.      When pruning, always trim the plant so that its natural      shape is maintained, and be sure to remove any injured      limbs or lowlying branches that may be blocking the      ventilation around the tree.<br />      <br />      If the quality of your trimmings is good, and you did your      initial homework of checking with prospective buyers to      find out their preferred holly varieties <em>before</em>      planting the trees, marketing your greens should require      little more than boxing up a few sprigs and showing them to      florists in your area. Fiveand ten-pound allotments of      <em>commercially</em> raised holly sell for over $11 and      $20, respectively . . . and though your operation won't be      competitive with the technology used by the large      out-of-state commercial suppliers (who treat the sprigs      with hormones to retain their freshness and use      refrigerated trucks for shipping), you should be able to      develop a local market for your hollies.<br />      <br />      So, during this Christmas season, as you decorate your home      for the holidays and give thanks for the blessings of the      past year, you might consider planting a holly tree next      spring. Its boughs and berries will adorn your home's      interior and enhance the natural beauty of the winter      landscape . . . and the extra trimmings, could even provide      you with a bit of pocket cash. And perhaps the holly's      greatest gift is that, long after the Christmas tree has      been taken down and the packages unwrapped and all but      forgotten, that growing holly tree will serve as a living      reminder of our appreciation for the beauty and peace to be      found on this earth.    </p>
