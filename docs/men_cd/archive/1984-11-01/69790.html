                <p>      <strong>Homesteading Handbook</strong>    </p>                                <p>      It's a fact that can't be ignored: The cost of building is      leaping skyward at a tremendous pace. In just the past ten      years, building costs have doubled, the rise being      attributable to the increase in both material costs and      labor rates. And today's higher prices have forced many      people to abandon the idea of erecting buildings that they      both need and want.</p><p> That is the reason MOTHER decided to      print this feature, adapted from the book Pole      <em>Building,</em> by Norm Ecker, Sr., and Jeff Flanders.      Norm and Jeff don't feel you should have to go without the      garage, shed, or barn you need any longer. Pole building      can save you money! For openers, you can knock 50Â°70      off the cost of a building by doing the work yourself. The      simplicity of this method of construction allows even an      inexperienced builder to erect a sound and safe shelter.      With the proper tools, and using the systematic approach      presented in the following pages, you can put up your own      building and save hundreds, or even thousands, of dollars.    </p>    <p>      It's not just doing the work yourself that will save money,      because pole building also conserves material. Pole      structures don't require conventional foundations, which      means you won't need to hire a backhoe at $20 an hour to      dig a footer, or hire a mason at $15 an hour to lay block      for the foundation. Pole buildings also use less lumber      than do conventional structures, and at the price of 2 X      4's today, that material can add up quickly.    </p>    <p>      With this article, some simple tools, determination, and a      little healthy. sweat, you can have that building that you      were going to postpone or go without entirely. Norm and      Jeff will lead you through the construction stepby-step,      and when you're done, you'll not only have money in your      pocket, but also the satisfaction of having created your      own place.    </p>    <p>      One of the advantages of building a pole structure is that      it requires only basic hand tools from the ground up. Most      people will have a majority of the tools needed, but if      you're missing something and can't borrow it from a friend,      try a rental agency, which carries most anything, usually      at very reasonable rates. The following is a list of the      tools you will need:    </p>    <p>      [1] Posthole digger<br />      [2] Handsaw (good and sharp)<br />      [3] Chain saw (optional)<br />      [4] A 4' level<br />      [5] Nylon chalk line (200')<br />      [6] Shovel<br />      [7] Large wrecking bar<br />      [8] Framing square<br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      [9] Try square<br />      [10] A good rule<br />      [11] Tin snips<br />      [12] Two 100' tapes<br />      [13] Hammer<br />      [14] Line level<br />      [15] Circular saw    </p>    <p>      <strong>Site Preparation</strong>    </p>    <p>      A s in other building methods, before any actual      construction begins, you will want to ready the general      location of the proposed building, known as the building      site. Site preparation for pole buildings is, in most      cases, a fairly easy process.    </p>    <p>      The site for a pole building is generally considered to be      an area that's 5' larger in length and width than the      outside building dimensions. Staking and squari ng this      area is done in the same manner as squaring the building's      four corner posts, and for that reason, close attention      should be paid to the following directions.    </p>    <p>      Pick an approximate place for one corner of your site area      and drive a stake; this we will refer to as stake number 1.      Next, measure the length or width of the area and drive      stake 2. If you wish to keep your building square to an      existing landmark, such as a road, driveway, or another      structure, measure from the landmark to both stakes 1 and      2, making sure they are the same distance from the      landmark. To locate stake 3, measure from stake 2 at as      near a right angle as possible. To complete the location of      your site, measure from stakes 1 and 3 at the same time,      and at the point where the proper measurements intersect on      your tapes, drive stake 4.    </p>    <p>      You now must check the site for squareness, and, as noted      before, this is done using the same principle which applies      to squaring the building.    </p>    <p>      For any rectangle, you can check the squareness by      measuring the diagonals, which are the distances from      corner to corner (Fig. 2). If the rectangle is square, the      measurements of diagonals A and B will be the same; if they      are not, the stakes must be adjusted so they become so. If,      for example, diagonal B is longer than diagonal A, you can      correct this by moving stakes 3 and 4 back toward stake 1,      thus decreasing the length of B and increasing that of A.      Proceed by trial and error until the diagonals are equal.      It is important that stakes 3 and 4 be moved the same      distance each time. A rule of thumb is to move stakes 3 and      4 one-half the difference of your diagonals; e.g., if your      diagonals differ 10" in measurement, move the adjusting      stakes 5".    </p>    <p>      It is important while squaring to occasionally check your      measurements from stake to stake to be sure they remain      constant. If you don't have two tapes, or if the tapes you      have won't reach between your corners, a length of marked      rope or twine will suffice, as long as you work toward      making the diagonals equal.    </p>    <p>      Now that the site is marked, the task of preparing it for      building arises. The main thing to be concerned with here      is the leveling of the ground, either by removing the high      spots, filling in the low, or doing a little of both. If      you can't eyeball the site for hollows, humps, or runs, use      some. twine and a line level as in Fig. 3 to help level off      the area.    </p>    <p>      When a concrete floor is planned, the topsoil should be      stripped away and the area filled with bank gravel to a      height 6" above normal ground level. This allows for a      sound base and also helps in drainage. You might even wish      to run some perforated plastic pipe around the base to      further promote proper drainage.    </p>    <p>      Once the site has been readied, the building itself can be      laid out and the poles set.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Layout and Pole Setting</strong>    </p>    <p>      Laying the building out begins by staking out the four      corner posts, using the same method described in the      preceding section. When measuring, subtract 3" from the      width and length of your outside dimensions to allow for      the side girts; thus, if your building is to be 20' X 24',      stake it out 19' 9" X 23' 9".    </p>    <p>      Once your stakes are set and squared, you can begin digging      your holes. The stakes, remember, represent the outside      corner of your poles, so your hole should be dug      accordingly (Fig. 4). The poles you will be using will be      either 4" X 6" or 6" X 6"; to properly accommodate these,      your holes should be 12" or 14" in diameter. The holes      should be as deep as the average frostline in your area,      and a minimum of 3' . In most cases, 3' to 4' is adequate.    </p>    <p>      Wear gloves while digging; posthole diggers can eat even      the most callused hands. Use your shovel to dig as much as      possible; then take the wrecking bar and loosen the ground      and remove it with the posthole digger. If you don't relish      digging the holes by hand, you could hire a power posthole      digger, which you can locate through the yellow pages.      Whatever method you use, be sure that any loose dirt is      removed from the hole.    </p>    <p>      At this point, let us interject some advice on selecting      poles. First, be sure that the poles you buy have been      pressure-treated; shop around for those with the best      guarantee. In buildings with dimensions of less than 30',      4" X 6" poles are used; for larger buildings, a 6" X 6"      pole is better. Pick the straightest poles you can find.      Some warpage is inevitable, but you needn't buy a pretzel.      To determine the correct length, add the desired depth of      the pole below ground to your eaves' height, plus a foot.      For poles in a gable end, add enough so the truss can be      nailed to them (Fig. 5). The poles are, in effect, the      foundation of your building; choose them carefully.    </p>    <p>      You are now ready to set your corner poles. Before setting      a pole, pour a third of a bag of concrete mix in the hole;      this will act as a footer. Slide a pole in a hole and stand      it upright. Use your 4' level to level the pole in both      directions and attach it to braces (Fig. 6). Do not fill      the hole at this time. Instead, set all four corners in      this manner, checking the measurements and squaring from      the inside corners of the poles. To move a pole, use the      large wrecking bar as a lever and gently shift the bottom      of the pole. When all measurements are right, there is one      last squaring before filling the holes. Nail nylon string      about 9" above the ground and stretch it tightly around all      four poles, leveling between poles with a line level. Check      to see that each pole is squared to the line.    </p>    <p>      If the outside measurements, diagonals, and line squaring      all check out, the holes can be filled. This is done by      dumping the rest of a bag of concrete mix in the hole, and      then filling to ground level with earth. Tamp the earth      around the pole, but be careful not to jar or move the      pole. Unless you live in an extremely arid area, you won't      need to add any water to the concrete; soil moisture will      be sufficient.    </p>    <p>      The remainder of the poles may now be positioned. Starting      from the corner, measure 9' 9" down the string and 3" back      from it, and drive a stake. For each successive pole,      measure 10' from stake to stake (Fig. 7). If your building      plan doesn't allow equal distancing of poles using 10'      centers, place your poles where they will divide an area      equally. Do not place poles more than 10' apart except      where an overhead or slide by door opening will be located.      Be sure, when measuring to locate these in-between poles,      that all measurements originate from the same end of the      building. Gambrel roof buildings wider than 20' require a      row of poles down the middle of the building. These may be      located by measuring between two outside stakes, splitting      the measurement in half, and setting a stake (see Fig. 7).      Take down the nylon string and dig all remaining holes,      then replace the line before setting the poles. Keep the      outside face of the pole flush with the string, making sure      the pole is not pushing on it. Measure, level, and brace as      shown (Fig. 8). When all poles are set, checked, and      filled, move on to your top and bottom plates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Top and Bottom Plates</strong>    </p>    <p>      The first framing attached to the set poles is the bottom      plate, which is usually a 2 X 10 treated plank. The reason      for using a treated plank is that the bottom plate sits      close to the ground and often has fill pushed up against      it, which would hold dampness and rot untreated lumber.    </p>    <p>      To locate the bottom plate, begin by measuring 1I" -from      the ground levelon a corner pole. Run a chalk line from      corner to corner, using a line level to check for      levelness, then snap the line so that each pole is marked.      Place a plank with the top edge even with the lines. Also      be sure that if the plank doesn't run from one end of the      building to another, it ends at the middle of a pole (Fig.      9). Nail the plank with pole barn nails; they are      especially hardened and ribbed so they anchor very securely      in the pole. Do not use regular common nails, as they may      work loose because of the preservative in the wood. Run the      planks all around the building, using four or five nails in      each pole. Double-check to be sure the plate is level.    </p>    <p>      Use the bottom plate for reference when locating the top      plate. For an 8' eave height, measure up from the top of      the bottom plate 7' 9" on each pole, and mark across the      face of the pole with a try square. When marking eave      heights other than 8', subtract 3" and mark as already      described. The lines represent the top of the plate; run      your plank to them and nail as you did the bottom. These      planks should be untreated 2 X 10's. After the plate is      nailed all around the building, use your try square to mark      each pole on the inside the same height as the outside      plate. Nail another plate around the inside of the      building, making a double top plate (Fig. 10).    </p>    <p>      Now, 45Â° bracing can be placed between the poles to      strengthen the building (Fig. 9). Come down 18" or 2' on      each pole to locate one end of the brace. The brace should      be made of a 2 X 6 with a 45Â° angle cut across one end.      The brace will go up between the two top plates; nail into      the brace with No. 16 common nails. Use the first brace as      a pattern to mark the rest with.    </p>    <p>      At this point, the poles that stick above the top plate can      be cut of. This can be done with either a sharp handsaw or      a chain saw. If you are using a chain saw, observe all      safety precautions. It's better to be safe now than sorry      later.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Side Girts</strong>    </p>    <p>      The method of framing the walls is another area in which      pole building differs from conventional construction.      Instead of vertical studding on 16" centers, 2 X 4's are      run across the poles horizontally (Fig. 11). These 2 X 4's      are called girts. Girts are placed 24" on center measuring      up from the bottom plate. It is best to measure on each      corner pole and strike a line to keep the girts level      across the building.    </p>    <p>      The only place studding will be necessary is in the rough      openings for windows and doors. On either side of a window      or doorway there must be a pole or a stud. The distance      between these studs is determined by the rough opening      width of your door or window. Studs are 2 X 6's placed in      between the two top plates and down vertically to the      bottom plate (Fig. 12). Studs should be leveled with a 4'      level.    </p>    <p>      To complete the framing, run pieces of 2 X 6 horizontally      at the top and bottom of your rough opening-for doors, of      course, just at the top. The studding can be done before      the girts are put on, and the girts cut out of the opening,      or the girts can be cut to the opening and put on after the      studding is in. When the studding and girts are installed,      cut blocks to run around the opening to bring the entire      face of the opening flush to the girts (Fig. 13).    </p>    <p>      Sound short and simple? Absolutely.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Second-Story joists</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you are planning a building with a second floor, the      floor joists are the next step. The joists are 2 X 8's or 2      X 10's sitting on the top plate, running from one side of      the building to the other. If the building is too wide to      run a solid joist, there should be a supporting plate      running down the middle or wherever the joist joints will      be (Fig. 14).    </p>    <p>      The joists should be on 16" centers. Toenail them into the      top plate with 16d common nails. (You may want to cut      angles on the ends of your joists so they won't stick up      above the rafters and have to be cut later.)    </p>    <p>      When the joists are in place, you can put on your decking,      using at least I/2" CDX plywood panels. To start the      plywood, strike a line 1 ' in from the edge of the rafters.      This allows room for the rafters to rest on the top plate.      Nail the decking, staggering the joints as you go (Fig.      15).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rafters and Trusses</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rafter and truss are the terms most commonly given to the      structural framework of the roof. A rafter is one of the      parallel beams that support a roof, and a truss is an      assembled rigid framework. We will discuss trusses and      their setting, and then the laying out, building, and      setting of your own rafters.    </p>    <p>      Factory trusses have gained much popularity in the past few      years, for a number of reasons. Strength is one selling      point; they are engineer-designed, constructed with heavy      metal gussets, andbecause they are mass-produced-they are      uniform. From the self builder's point of view, simplicity      would have to be the shining attribute of trusses. It is      much easier to swing a truss into place and secure it than      to figure, cut, and erect rafters. Trusses can be bought      from many local lumber mills in a variety of styles.    </p>    <p>      The first truss set is known as the dead truss; it sits      along the outside wall against a pole (Fig. 16). It is      important that the dead truss be level, as the rest of the      trusses will be set using it as a guide. When using purlins      on your roof, you may space your truss 4' on center unless      you have a very low roof pitch or expect heavy snow loads.      For other applications use a 2' center. Mark on the top      plate the location of the truss, 4' from the outside of one      to the inside of another (Fig. 17). Place one end of the      truss on the top plate, then walk the other end up, leaving      the truss hanging inverted between the walls. To right the      truss, push it up with a 2 X 4 wedged in the peak. When the      bottom of the truss is in place and nailed to the top      plate, measure from the dead truss near the peak the same      outside-inside measurement used at the plates. Anchor the      truss in place, using temporary bracing running from the      dead truss (Fig. 18). Repeat this procedure until all your      trusses are set. Keep in mind that as you get to the end of      the building, you will run out of space to swing the last      couple of rafters up into place, so plan ahead by raising      the last few all at once and setting them later. Be sure,      too, that the overhang of the truss remains the same all      the way down the building; it may be necessary to push or      pull the walls just a little.    </p>    <p>      If you can't get factory trusses or would rather build your      own, the next section is for you. Here we'll discuss how to      lay out and build gambrel roof rafters and saddle roof      rafters.    </p>    <p>      The saddle roof (see Fig. 23) is probably the most common      roof today, and constructing its rafters is fairly simple.    </p>    <p>      The first thing to determine before laying out your rafters      is what pitch you want your roof to have. Roof pitch is      usually given in terms of height rise in the roof per foot;      that is, a 4-12 roof pitch has a peak that rises 4" for      every foot horizontally along the top plate to the middle      of the building (Fig. 19). To ascertain the approximate      length of 2 X 4 or 2 X 6 you'll need for your rafters,      consult the rafter conversion table on your framing square,      which, with a given pitch, will give you the length of the      rafter. To this you should add any overhang you desire.      This will give you the total length of the rafter.    </p>    <p>      The step-off method is used most frequently in laying out      rafters, and entails the use of your framing square. Mark      the ridge end of the rafter first, by laying your square      with 12" on the blade and the unit of rise in the tongue      both lining up on the edge of the rafter (Fig. 20). If the      line length does not come to an even foot measurement,      measure the smaller length from the top, then mark down the      rafter a foot at a time until you get to the building line.      At this point turn the square upside down, and mark out the      overhang just as you have the rest of the rafter. To mark      out the notch where the rafter sits on the plate, commonly      called the bird's-mouth, run your square at a right angle      to the building line about a third of the way up the line,      and mark out the notch and the end of the overhang (Fig.      21). Use this piece as a pattern for the rest of your      rafters.    </p>    <p>      To erect rafters of this type, mark out their locations on      both sides of the ridgepole, and nail one side of each      rafter to the pole. Set the ends of the rafters in place      along the plate, and raise the ridge to its proper height      with temporary 2 X 4 braces (Fig. 22). Now nail the rafters      for the other side. Stud in the front and back peaks on 16"      centers (Fig. 23).    </p>    <p>      The style of roof that many of us associate with barns is      properly called a gambrel roof (see Fig. 24c). The reason      for its popularity in barns is that it provides a large      amount of storage area at a reasonable cost. Since a      gambrel roof truss with its cross bracing would defeat this      open space advantage, gambrel roof rafters are cut and      erected on the site in the following manner.    </p>    <p>      Place a 2 X 6 on each side of your roof deck so that the      ends come out even with the edge of the joists on one end,      and approximately 2' to 3' in from the edge on the other      end (Fig. 24a). Temporarily nail these pieces in place      after checking to be sure your measurements were the same.      Next lay out two 2 X 6's so that they run across the end of      the two you have secured and cross each other in the exact      middle of the deck; temporarily nail. Mark lines through      the joints at the hips and the peak (Fig. 24b), and cut      through the boards at the same time. The four pieces should      now fit tightly at the joints. Nail 2 X 4's to make a jig      for assembling the pieces uniformly. Mark your pieces as      patterns, and mark out one rafter at a time; when the      pieces are cut, place them in the jig and nail them at the      joints. For added strength at the joints, make plywood      gussets 1 ' wide and 4' long out of 1/2" plywood. Lay them      at the joints and cut them to fit the angles (Fig. 24c).      Glue the rafters and nail the gussets with No. 6 coated box      nails. Do this on both sides of each rafter (except for the      end rafters, which should only be done on the inside face).      Set your end rafter, bracing it well and making sure it's      level, then set the remaining rafters, securing each one as      described in the truss setting.    </p>    <p>      When assembling either the saddle or the gambrel roof, if      you desire an overhang on the ends of the building, you      must build ladders and attach them. Ladders are framed with      the same material as the rafters, or with 2 X 4's. A ladder      has two runners with spacers every 16" (Fig. 25). Nail the      ladders into the end rafters with 16d nails.    </p>    <p>      Tails for a gambrel should also be attached at this time; a      few styles are illustrated in Fig. 26.    </p>    <p>      If you're going to use metal on your roof, you'll need roof      purlins. Purlins serve much the same function as the side      girts; they too are 2 X 4's spaced on 24" centers across      the rafters (Fig. 27).    </p>    <p>      Preparations should now be complete for the actual      roofing.<br />      <br />      <strong>Roofing</strong>    </p>    <p>      here are three basic choices of material used in roofing      pole buildings: steel, aluminum, and asphalt shingles over      plywood; each has its own advantages and disadvantages.      Steel and aluminum are strong, quick to apply, relatively      maintenancefree, and less costly than shingles and plywood.      On the other hand, when they're used in heated buildings      without adequate ventilation, condensation may form and the      metal will sweat. Plywood and shingles provide a tighter      roof that holds heat better than metals, but that costs a      little more and deteriorates faster.    </p>    <p>      Steel usually comes in a 32" width, which covers 30", and      in lengths up to 18' . Aluminum comes in 36" and 38" widths      and can be special-ordered in lengths up to 28' . Steel and      aluminum are applied in the same manner, so the following      instructions apply to both.    </p>    <p>      The most important part of putting on a metal roof is      starting the first piece square to the eaves. Allow a 1 "      overhang at the eaves, making sure the measurement is the      same on both sides of your piece. Fasten steel with      galvanized roof nails and aluminum roof nails; these nails      are ribbed and have a neoprene washer to seal them. Nail      through the high ridges of the metal, drawing the nail      tight enough to bring pressure on it without flattening it      (Fig. 28). Each successive piece overlaps the preceding      one; nail through both pieces.    </p>    <p>      Check as you apply each piece to see that the overhang is      running the same; if the pieces begin to run unevenly, you      will have to pull them. Let us say that on one piece you      have an overhang of 1" on one side, and 1-1/2" on the      other. To even this out, use a hammer to pull the metal      straight. If you wish to take the metal back toward the      eaves, push the metal at the top-causing a slight hump-and      nail; then, on the bottom, stick the claw of your hammer in      the rib and pull the metal toward you. -If you are short on      the far edge and need to bring the metal out from the      eaves, reverse the procedure (Fig. 29).    </p>    <p>      When cutting metal, get a good metal blade for your      circular saw or turn an old plywood blade backward and use      that. Protective goggles and earplugs are a must. Aluminum      can be cut with a pair of tin snips.    </p>    <p>      If two lengths of metal are needed to reach the peak, be      sure the top piece is put on last and overlaps the bottom      by 4" or 5".    </p>    <p>      At the top the two sides will not join together tightly,      making a ridge cap necessary. The cap is specially designed      to fit the metal you are using and will be either a one- or      two-piece cap (Fig. 30). With the cap on, a metal roof is      complete.    </p>    <p>      A plywood-and-shingle roof does not require purlins, as      plywood is nailed directly to the rafters. Measure up on      both end rafters approximately 47" and strike a chalk line;      this will leave a 1" overhang to allow for the fascia. Run      the plywood on this line, spacing the rafters 2' on center      as you go. Nail with No. 6 common or box nails. When the      next row of plywood is applied, stagger the joints so they      don't coincide with those of the previous row (Fig. 15).    </p>    <p>      When the plywood is on, cover it with 15-pound felt (which      comes in rolls and is stapled to the roof as an      undercoating for the shingles). Next, nail aluminum or      galvanized drip edge around the edge of the roof, and then      begin shingling. We will not go into detail on shingle      application, as most bundles have excellent directions. If      you desire further explanation, consult your library for a      book on roofing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Siding</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are many types of siding available. I'll discuss the      three most common: boardand-batten, metal, and sheathing.    </p>    <p>      Most rural areas will have a small independent. sawmill      where you can buy rough-cut lumber at a substantial      reduction over lumberyard prices. The planks, usually 1"      thick, will vary in width and are sold by the board foot.      You will also want a quantity of 3" or 4" battens cut.    </p>    <p>      The boards are started on a corner of the building, with      the planks leveled vertically as they're applied. Number 7      or 8 cement-coated nails are best suited for applying this      type of siding. The planks should run down onto the bottom      plate without covering it completely (Fig. 31). When the      planks are in place, the windows and doors should be placed      in their openings and secured. Next, the battens are      positioned over each joint. Rough-cut lumber will dry and      shrink, so it's important that the battens adequately cover      the joints (Fig. 32).    </p>    <p>      In siding as in roofing, the metals, steel and aluminum,      will be discussed together, as they are applied in the same      manner.    </p>    <p>      Before you begin siding with the metals, set your windows      and doors. Each window and door should have a drip cap      across the top and J channel down the sides and under the      bottom of the window; this allows the cut edges of the      siding to be covered (Fig. 33).    </p>    <p>      Start at a corner, making sure the siding is level. When      applying the metals as a siding, nail through the flat      valleys instead of the ribs, except ad the joints where the      two pieces overlap. Use the same kind of nails as you did      on the roof. Always start at the bottom so any higher      pieces will overlap the lower. When the sides are on, put      on the corner caps, which are 6" X 6" L-shaped pieces.      Also, if your roof doesn't have an overhang, you will run      this material along the roof and the siding (Fig. 34).    </p>    <p>      The last type of siding is sheathing: 4' X 8' pieces of      plywood. The most commonly used is Texture 1-11, a heavy      plywood with a rough grooved surface. Again, start from a      corner and level your piece. You may want to put in backing      blocks between the girts where a joint is located; this is      optional but considered a good practice (Fig. 35). After      the siding is on, set the windows and doors.    </p>    <p>      When cutting the angle of the roof pitch on any of these      materials, use your framing square to set your angle. If,      for instance, you have a 4-12 pitch, place the foot mark on      the low corner, go up 4" on the other angle, mark it, and      draw a line from the corner through the mark.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The book from which this article was      adapted-Pole Building:</em> A Step by Step Guide, <em>by      Norm Ecker, Sr., and Jeff Flanders-contains all of the      information present</em> <em>d in this Homestead Handbook      plus plans for a 30' X 40' X 12' tool shed . . . a 24' X      24'</em> <em>X 8' two-car garage . . . and a 20' X 40' X 8'      four-horse barn.
