                <h5 id="byline">by Mark Jordan</h5>    <p>      "I'd like some of those black, shiny nails with circles      going around them," I said brightly.<br />      Bob looked at me. I knew his name was Bob from the label on      his green work shirt. His eyes glittered like those of a      starving wolf ready to devour its kill; then he looked back      down at the paper in front of him, pulled a pencil from      behind his ear, and began to write.<br />      <br />      I waited a moment, unsure of his gesture, then asked again      in a smaller voice. Bob never looked up but spoke in a      slow, evil tone, "Buddy, find out what it is you want, and      then come back here."<br />      <br />      Chagrined, I turned and walked out of the store past three      smirking men in work clothes. I felt their eyes burn my      neck and heard peals of laughter erupt when I left the      store.I cursed the lumberyard quietly and furtively. Then,      with the undying optimism of a man with a cause, I headed      for the hardware store.<br />      <br />      The hardware store man was with a fellow who had a tape      measure gadget on his belt. They were deep in      conversation-something about 12-2 Romex-and      made frequent, reverent references to "The Code." I lined      up behind the workman and waited my turn. Two other workmen      came in wearing huge grins, greeting each other and the      hardware man like bosom buddies and getting what they      needed.<br />      <br />      After about 20 minutes and much coughing and shuffling of      my feet, I finally got the courage to speak. Just as I      began, the workman looked at his watch and said in a voice      louder than mine, "Well, John, I gotta be heading      back-I was supposed to be back 20 minutes ago." They      both laughed, and he turned and brushed by me. His tape      measure jabbed me, then fell to the floor. As he stooped to      get it, his eyes narrowed.<br />      <br />      "Watch it, bud,"<br />      <br />      he snarled. Shaken, I waited for him to leave before      stepping to the counter. "Do you have any of those black,      shiny nails with the little circles going around them? To      help them stick, I think," I stammered.<br />      <br />      He looked at me for a moment as if in deep concentration,      then said in a loud voice, "Those are in the left aisle."      Gratefully, I headed for what I presumed to be the left      aisle.<br />      <br />      Suddenly I realized he had been talking to a clerk in the      front of the store. With one last effort I returned to the      counter. He watched me, then reached for a phone. The next      thing I knew, he was talking to Black & Decker about      the jigsaws that were supposed to be in last Tuesday.<br />      <br />      I walked out of the store depressed and ended up in a      grocery store where I found some nails in a plastic bag      that were smooth and big but nevertheless would have to      do.<br />      <br />      Those were my early days as a do-it-yourselfer. They were      dark days indeed. Drugstores and grocery stores were very      limited in their choice of hardware. The remodeling project      I had started came to a plaster-falling halt. Despite the      chaos, I rebelled against the construction      industry-never would I return to those malevolent      retailers.<br />      <br />      My holdout ended when a raccoon made its home in our attic.      Nocturnal noises overhead had warned us of our unwanted      tenant, but it wasn't until the masked intruder fell      through the ceiling into a pot of steaming borscht that its      identity was ascertained. My wife screamed, the raccoon      escaped, and I, after masking the hole with a piece of      cardboard, drove straight to the public library. I returned      two hours later with the construction shelf's entire      collection.<br />      <br />      I read. I memorized. My wife gave me quizzes. I even      outlined chapters. Finally, I was ready. Armed with typed      note cards in my shirt pocket and tiny reminders on my      cuff, I headed back to Bob's lumberyard. Inside, I      immediately spotted Bob. He was leaning over the counter,      the pencil in his ear pointed right at my heart. I turned      and almost walked out, but all that study and the taste of      plaster dust turned me back. With a determined step I      approached the counter. "Yes," said Bob menacingly, but      never looking up.<br />      <br />      "I'd like some 3/4-inch A/C, exterior grade fir plywood." I      said it fast, like a child in a Christmas program, remotely      and without comprehension. Bob looked up.<br />      <br />      "Yeah? Well, is that it?"<br />      <br />      "No, I'd also like some . . ." I panicked. My mind raced      furiously, grasping at every building term I had learned.      In that same instant, my dilating eyes happened to catch      the words on my sleeve, which was rising to cover my      panic-stricken face. Rapidly I read, " . . . quartersawed      oak, surfaced on four sides, 3/4-inch, 16 board      feet."<br />      <br />      Bob broke into a broad smile. He yanked the pencil from      behind his ear and wrote down my order. He called to the      yard and had them check to see how soon they could get it.      I tried to hide my surprise, but when he added, "If you're      going to be buying in quantity, we can get you a discount,"      my mouth dropped wide open.<br />      <br />      As I was leaving, I almost bumped into a workman who'd just      entered. Before I could utter a word of apology, he      exclaimed, "Oh, excuse me, sir. Clumsy of me not to see      you." As I turned to close the door behind me, both he and      Bob were beaming and waving goodbye.    </p>        <p>      That day revived my remodeling career. No longer did I fear      the Workmen of the World. I had discovered the key, the      passport without which no one may enter this group or any      other: words. Just words. Know their terms, and you'll make      the team. Protected by the time-honored jargon, I snuggled      into that green-work-shirt society. And it got very      cozy.<br />      <br />      One day Jerry, my neighbor, asked me if I had any small,      black nails with little circles going around them. For a      moment, a scowl jerked between my eyebrows. A thousand Bobs      in a thousand cliques from time immemorial scowled      delightedly with me.<br />      <br />      But then I remembered.<br />      <br />      I smiled and said, "Sure." I got him the nails, and as he      was leaving I told him, "By the way, if you ever try to      pick these up at the lumberyard, ask for drywall      nails."<br />      <br />      Jerry smiled and said, "Hey, thanks a lot. I'll do that.      You know, you ought to go into the business, selling      hardware and stuff: You'd do real good."<br />      <br />      I've thought a lot about that, while pounding nails.    </p>
