                <p>      <em>For beautiful wall hangings and cushions, and luxurious      woolen rugs you'll love underfoot, try . . .</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Marilyn Livingston</h5><p>      Australia, home of so many curious and unusual creatures,      is also the -home of an interesting variation on the craft      of locker hooking. Similar in some respects to rug hooking,      locker hooking involves pulling yarn through a rug canvas      in loops that are then "locked" into place with a hidden      strand of wool. Although it's hardly a byword in most craft      circles, locker hooking has been with us for quite some      time. In the 1920's, British craftswomen commonly employed      the art to make rugs, using heavy, six-ply wool yarn. In      the 1940's, Americans followed suit; but, perhaps because      of the high cost of such yarn, the craft never achieved      great popularity here. Now, however, thanks to the artistic      sensibility and ingenuity of a craftswoman Down Under, we      may see a renewal of interest.<br />      <br />      <strong>A BIT OF HISTORY</strong><br />      <br />      The Aussie variation consists of a small, but very      <em>significant,</em> change in the type of wool used,      rather than any alteration of the basic procedure. This      change came about when Australian Brian Benson, on tour in      Ireland in 1972, saw demonstrations of locker hooking,      became fascinated by the craft, and took several hooks home      to his mother. A well-known fiber artist, Patricia Benson      quickly mastered the craft and completed a handsome rug of      heavy, handspun yarn. The piece commanded a great deal of      attention when displayed; but Patricia quickly realized      that if locker hooking was to become popular, something      would have to be found that could be substituted for the      heavy yarn required. Commercially prepared six-ply wool      twist was expensive, and few people had the time or      inclination to spin their own. So Pat began using unspun,      freshly sheared wool . . . and Australian locker hooking      was born.<br />      <br />      Patricia Benson discovered that lengths of combed wool,      forger-thick but unspun, could be hooked through the holes      of canvas and held in place with a strand of spun yarn. The      resulting rugs were beautifully soft and springy underfoot,      and they wore well, too. The craft was enthusiastically      received in Australia, where sheep breeding and the      production of wool are major industries.<br />      <br />      In 1980, Marj Boyes-teacher of, and crusader for,      locker hooking-came to the United States and      introduced Benson's technique. Here was a chance for      American crafts people to work with unprocessed wool      <em>without</em> having to invest in the lengthy training      and expensive equipment required to master spinning and      weaving. In fact, wool in any of a number of stages of      finishing can be used, starting with the freshly sheared      material right on through spun yarn twist . . . for while      Australian locker hooking introduced the idea of using      <em>unspun wool,</em> the original European craft employed      finished fibers.    </p>     <p><strong>WHAT'S NEEDED?</strong></p>        <p>      To try your hand at locker hooking, you'll need a locker      hook, locker cord or yarn, rug canvas, a yarn needle, wool,      and-if raw wool is to be used-a metal comb or      wire-bristled cards<br />      <br />      . The <em>locker hook</em> (see Fig. 1) resembles a rug      hook or heavy crochet hook with a large eye opposite the      hook end. Like a traditional rug hook, it has to be fairly      deep to accommodate the thick fibers used. If locker hooks      aren't available at your local craft shop, they can be      mail-ordered (see the end of this article for the names and      addresses of two suppliers).<br />      <br />      <em>Locker yarn</em> should be sturdy cord or yarn just      fine enough to be easily threaded through the hook's eye.      Four-ply knitting wool is the ideal yarn, but other types      can be used successfully. Any color is suitable because the      yarn doesn't show . . . but it is best to choose one that      blends with the basic color of your hooked piece.<br />      <br />      Sized <em>rug canvas</em> without a plastic coating is used      for the backing. Plastic-coated canvas is the type most      often found in craft outlets, but it cuts the wool fibers      and won't soften enough when washed to be compatible with      this supple filling. Cotton or cotton-polyester canvas also      seems to serve the purpose better than the 100% polyester      variety. Be sure to specify which type you need when you      buy. Mesh size of three or four squares per inch is      suitable.<br />      <br />      A <em>yarn needle,</em> easily purchased in any department      store or craft outlet, is needed for concealing the locker      yarn ends and finish ing the edges of the project if it's      intended as a rug or wall hanging.    </p>        <p>      Wool, when it's kept out of the clutches of factories and      protected from destructive chemicals, is a soft, durable,      warm, lovely, luxurious fiber. It's neither harsh, nor      prickly, nor as allergenic as many people think it is. The      wool you use can be freshly sheared, or washed and carded,      or in "roving" form (washed, combed, and formed into      smooth, long hanks). Of course, freshly sheared wool will      be the material of choice for most folks who raise sheep .      . . but if you find that wool smells much better on the      hoof than in the house, you might want to wash the fleece      in a mild detergent or soap, rinsing it well and letting it      dry before using it. Don't wring or agitate the wool when      washing: It will soak clean. (Wash <em>and</em> rinse the      fleece in water of the same temperature.)<br />      <br />      A metal <em>pet comb</em> can be used to separate the wool      fibers, creating a light, fluffy mass and removing any      leftover dirt or vegetable matter that may have remained in      the fleece. Metal combs can be purchased at pet shops,      department stores, or grocery outlets.<br />      <br />      If you can get them, <em>hand cards</em> (Fig. 2) are      useful to straighten the fibers, but they can be quite      difficult for a novice to use. A few U.S. mills will, for a      fee, wash and card raw wool for you. They'll return it as      wool batts (large pieces of wool suitable for quilts) or      roving, which is available in craft and yarn outlets.<br />      <br />      <strong>KEEP IT SIMPLE</strong><br />      <br />      Australian locker hooking is best suited to simple      patterns. If you decide to follow a design, just draw it on      the rug canvas with a permanent fiber-tip pen or acrylic      paint.<br />      <br />      If your project is a pillow or any other article having      seams, be sure to leave three or four rows of canvas for      your seam allowance. In the case of rugs or wall hangings      that require finished borders, you'll want to fold back two      or three rows on the edge to make a selvage. I like to clip      out the corners with scissors rather than try to hook      through four thicknesses of canvas (Fig. 3), and I sew the      folded row in place using the zigzag stitch on my sewing      machine.    </p>        <p>      It's easiest to begin hooking in the third row from the      edge (Fig. 4). Thread the needle eye of the hook with      approximately three feet of locker yarn, and take a piece      of wool that's been stretched to about the width of your      index finger and tapered at both ends. The wool can be      shaped by grasping a clump in both hands and gently but      firmly pulling until it reaches the size you need: thick      enough to fill the holes in the canvas, but thin enough to      pull through easily.<br />      <br />      If you're right-handed, you'll work from right to left.      First, weave the threaded locker hook in and out of the      canvas to anchor the end of the strand in place (when you      get more familiar with the technique, you can generally      just let it hang loose). Then hold the canvas in front of      you, with the hem on the underside, and draw your hook from      the bottom to the top through the second hole (Fig. 5),      leaving several inches of locker yarn hanging loose on      top.<br />      <br />      Now, holding the lock of wool in your left hand underneath      the canvas, run your hook down through the next hole. Lay      the strand of wool over the hook, at a point about one inch      from the tapered end. Fold that short end under the hook      and back into the main strand of wool, making a loop on the      hook (Fig. 6). Draw this loop up through the hole and      <em>leave it in place</em> on the hook shaft while you pass      the hook down through the next hole, catch another loop of      wool, and draw it up through the hole (Fig. 7). In a sense,      you're crocheting through the holes of the canvas. Continue      in this way until you have three or four loops-or      however many you feel comfortable with-on the hook.      Then draw the hook and the locker yarn through all the      loops, locking them in place on top of the canvas (Fig. 8).    </p>        <p>      When you run out of wool, simply elongate another piece,      tapering the ends as before, and overlap the ends of the      old and new pieces (see Fig. 8 again) so that the overlap      is no thicker than the rest of the strand. The fibers will      interlock . . . but catch up any ends so they don't show      and there's no indication of a splice (which could be a      weak spot in the finished piece).<br />      <br />      When you're about six inches from the end of your strand of      locker yarn, pull it out of the hook eye and let it hang      from the front of the canvas. Rethread the hook and begin      hooking in the next hole as if you'd never run out of yarn;      but when you pull the new locker yarn through the hoops,      leave a six-inch tail hanging on top of the canvas. This      end, like the end of the old yarn, will be woven in later      with the yarn needle (Fig. 9).<br />      <br />      <strong>SQUARE THOSE CORNERS!</strong>    </p>        <p>      Corners and turns require a special technique if they're to      be neat and secure. Here's how it works.<br />      <br />      When you come to the end of a row, run your hook all the      way down through the next hole in line. Pull the locker      yarn taut, but not tight, and decide which direction you      want to hook in next.<br />      <br />      If you want to go at a right angle to your first row, move      <em>back</em> one hole-to the one in which you last      hooked-and bring the hook all the way up through that      hole right next to the loop it already contains. Then begin      hooking to the left (Fig. 10). This procedure should be      followed whenever you turn a corner, and will create a      clean right angle.<br />      <br />      If, on the other hand, you'd rather go back alongside your      first row, bring the hook up through the next empty hole to      the <em>left.</em> Give your piece a quarter turn to the      right, and then begin hooking toward the left, beside the      first row.<br />      <br />      Craftswoman Joan Rough-owner of Fox Hollow Fibres and      author of <em>Australian Locker Hooking: A New Approach to      a Traditional Craft,</em> which was the primary source for      most of this information-explains it thus: "Always      bring the hook up one square behind the one in which you'll      hook the first loop of any row in a new direction."<br />      <br />      When you come to the final stitch, after filling all the      holes in the canvas, run the hook down through the next      filled hole, drawing the locker yarn after it, and remove      the yarn from the eye. Thread the end onto the yarn needle,      and weave it in and out the back of the loops and the      canvas so that it's firmly anchored and hidden from sight.      Trim any ends.    </p>        <p><strong>FINISHING UP</strong></p>        <p>      Edges can be finished in      various ways. When making a pillow, for instance, you can      hand-sew a backing or stitch one on with a sewing machine.      Other projects can be whipstitched along the edges with raw      wool or homespun yarn for a decorative effect. Another      attractive alternative is to hook a fringe around the      edges, using a lark's head knot (Fig. 11) . . . or, if you      leave the outside row of holes empty until last, you can      crochet a finished edge, using one stitch per hole.<br />      <br />      Locker-hooked items are easy to care for and can be either      dry-cleaned or washed. If you choose the second      alternative, just remember to soak-not      agitate-the pieces and gently squeeze the water      through; and be sure that the wash water and rinse water      are the same temperature (not one warm, the other      cold).<br />      <br />      <strong>SOURCES AND RESOURCES</strong><br />      <br />      Joan Rough's instruction book (mentioned above), which      includes one locker hook, can be ordered from Fox Hollow      Fibres, Rt. 1, Box 161A, Glasgow, VA 24555 (brochure free      with SASE). Kits and materials are available from Hand-Dun      Originals, 500 N. Augusta Dr., Augusta, MI 49012 (catalog      free with SASE). As of this writing, the prices on locker      hooking equipment are as follows: locker hook, $2.50;      instruction book with enclosed hook, $6.95; project kits      (including wool, locker yarn, book and hook, and canvas),      $13.00-$19.00. These prices don't include shipping and      handling costs or sales tax.<br />      <br />      Crafts people who are skilled at such things might want to      try making their own locker hooks from wood, bone, or      metal. These should be about 6-1/2" long (shaft diameter      about 1/8"), with an eye at least 3/8" long and a hook      equivalent to size H or 8 as standard crochet hooks are      measured.<br />      <br />      As the photographs show, Australian locker hooking lends      itself to some handsome designs . . . and lest you think      the pieces are fragile, one craftswoman I know has had a      locker-hooked rug on the floor of her foyer for five years,      and it's still bright, beautiful, and intact.    </p>
