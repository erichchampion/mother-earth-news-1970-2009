        The professional butcher would begin by cutting down the spine to split the carcass in half lengthwise. Each half is then divided into hindquarter, midsection, and forequarter. Each of these three main sections can then be butchered into large portions, as labeled above. The smaller drawings indicate a few, but by no means all, of the serving-size cuts and dishes that can be obtained from each portion.
