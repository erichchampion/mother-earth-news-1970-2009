                <p>      <em>Anne and Paul Ehrlich 's article on evolutionary theory      (MOTHER NO. 88) sparked a good bit of controversy. So, to      air the</em> other side of this question, we present the      following article.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Duane T. Gish, Ph.D.    </h5>    <p>      I was surprised by the polemical nature of the article      "Evolution and Ecoscience," by Anne and Paul Ehrlich, which      appeared in the July/August issue of THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS(restricted). Furthermore, the article contains a number of      inaccuracies and badly distorts many of the issues involved      in the creation/evolution controversy.<br />      <br />      The Ehrlichs state that "no knowledgeable biologist doubts      that evolution has occurred." There are actually many      knowledgeable biologists, most of whom have been trained in      some of the world's leading universities, who have become      convinced that evolutionary theory is scientifically      untenable and, moreover, that creation is a far more      credible explanation ....<br />      <br />      While propagating the dogma of evolution in 1984, Paul      Ehrlich has apparently forgotten the statement that he      published in an article with L.C. Birch in <em>Nature</em>      in 1967 (volume 214, page 352): "Our theory of evolution      has become one . . . which cannot be refuted by any      possible observations. Every conceivable observation can be      fitted into it. It is thus `outside of empirical science'      but not necessarily false. No one can think of ways in      which to test it. Ideas, either without basis or based on a      few laboratory experiments carried out in extremely      simplified systems, have attained currency far beyond their      validity. They have become part of an evolutionary dogma      accepted by most of us as part of our training." It is      obvious that a theory which is outside of empirical      science, which is incapable of being tested, and which has      become so plastic that no matter what the data may be,      every conceivable observation can be made to fit into it,      does not qualify as a scientific theory. Indeed, evolution      theory has become a dogma, the basic tenet of a      mechanistic, materialistic philosophy that dominates our      educational and scientific establishments.<br />      <br />      The Ehrlichs state that "without evolutionary theory,      biology would be a meaningless hodgepodge of facts." The      science of biology is actually a study of the      <em>operation</em> of living organisms-their biochemistry,      physiology, reproduction, development, and anatomy.      Evolutionary theory, on the other hand, is a collection of      notions about how living organisms came about in the first      place. Evolutionary theory is a theory about the      <em>history</em> of living organisms, not their      operation.<br />      <br />      Pierre Grasse, the most distinguished of French zoologists,      an evolutionist whose knowledge of the living world is      encyclopedic, has stated that biology tells us nothing      about the origin of living things ....<br />      <br />      The Ehrlichs state that "medicine has already suffered from      a widespread lack of appreciation of evolutionary      principles" and imply that the overuse of antibiotics was      due to ignorance of those principles. This is simply      nonsense. The vast majority of scientists and physicians      involved, indoctrinated in evolutionary theory, were well      aware of these principles and would have proceeded in      exactly the same manner with or without the theory. The      simple fact is that in any population of bacteria there is      considerable genetic variability. Long before these      bacteria were exposed to antibiotics, some of these      individuals possessed enzymes able to destroy certain      antibiotics-an ability purely coincidental to their normal      function in the metabolic activities of these bacteria.      When in the course of time man exposed these bacteria to      antibiotics, a few individuals in each population that      possessed those enzymes had the ability to destroy the      antibiotic and survive. They flourished and in some cases      have replaced the original susceptible populations.      Evolutionary theory had nothing to do with the discovery      and utilization of this knowledge ....<br />      <br />      Evolutionary theory has actually seriously hindered medical      science. For many years the discovery of the true functions      of such medically important organs as the tonsils and      appendix and even of such vital glands as the pineal and      thyroid glands were neglected, since in earlier times these      organs were considered to be useless vestigial organs left      over from our evolutionary past.<br />      <br />      The science of embryology was misdirected for many years      because of the now thoroughly discredited notion that an      embryo, during its development, recapitulates its      evolutionary history. Thus, embryologists wasted an      enormous amount of time attempting to use embryology to      work out evolutionary phylogenetic trees rather than      discovering why embryos develop the way they do. Russia,      where evolution is taught as part of a state-sanctioned      atheistic religion, has been the scene of some of the most      catastrophic ecological disasters in modern times      ....<br />      <br />      Ever since Darwin, evolutionists have searched in vain for      the countless transitional forms predicted on the basis of      evolution ary theory. Each basic type of plant or animal      appears in the fossil record abruptly, fully formed, just      as predicted on the basis of creation. The gaps are      systematic. Those who would hasten to point to "Lucy" as an      example of a transitional form between man and the apes      should be aware that formidable challenges to this claim      have already surfaced in anthropological circles, and also      should remember the tarnished history of this field with      its Piltdown man (a fraud), Nebraska man (based on a pig's      tooth), and Neanderthal man (now up-graded to <em>Homo      sapiens,</em> whose so-called primitive features were due      to pathological conditions).<br />      <br />      The science of thermodynamics makes clear that all observed      systems, from the molecular to the galactic, have a      universal natural tendency to go from order to disorder,      from complex to simple-exactly the opposite tendency      required for evolution. Thermodynamics makes clear that an      isolated system can never, of itself, become more complex      and highly organized, and yet evolutionists persist in      believing that the universe is an isolated system that      started in a state of primordial chaos and transformed      itself into the present incredibly complex universe.<br />      <br />      The odds against a mechanistic evolutionary process      spontaneously originating life anywhere in the universeeven      in 20 billion years-are so overwhelming that many former      evolutionists, including Sir Fred Hoyle, have become      convinced that wherever life appears in the universe, it      had to be created.<br />      <br />      Our students deserve a true education free from      indoctrination in any particular philosphy. They should      have the opportunity to hear all of the scientific evidence      related to origins, including that which supports creation      and that which supports evolution. We live in a      pluralistic, democratic society in which all citizens are      supposed to enjoy academic and religious freedoms.      Brainwashing students in evolutionary theory violates both      of these freedoms.<br />      <br />      <em>Duane T. Gish received his Ph.D. in biochemistry from      the University of California, Berkeley. After 18 years in      biochemical research at Cornell University Medical College,      the Virus Laboratory of the University of California,      Berkeley, and with The Upjohn Company, Dr. Gish in 1971      became the associate director of the Institute for Creation      Research in El Cajon, California.*</em>    </p>
