        TOP TO BOTTOM: In most holly species, only the female plant bears the familiar brilliant red berries. However; to insure adequate pollination and to induce fruiting, the female (pistillate) tree-shown here in bloom-must be planted within 100 feet of a male (staminate) holly tree .... The many varieties of holly can provide beautiful decorations for sale or for adding Christmas cheer to your home . . . or they can simply grace your landscape in their majestic natural forms.
