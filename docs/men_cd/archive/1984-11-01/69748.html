                <p>      <em>When you try this old-timey craft, you'll find that      there's more to an onion than waters the eye.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by Lynn Herion</h5>        <p>      Onion waxing is an old folk pastime. When I was a child, my      friends and I would gather buttons, broom straws, thread,      glitter, construction paper, and anything else that our      imaginations told us could be used for decorations.      Fashioning our onion creations provided us with many hours      of entertainment, and when the designing was complete, we'd      watch them sprout and grow.<br />      <br />      I've continued the tradition of onion waxing with my own      clan. It provides an ideal diversion for a rainy day, and      we use the finished products as decorations, gifts, and      party favors. The cost is right, too, since the only cash      outlay required is that for a few of the vegetables and for      a bit of paraffin. If you'd like to try the art of onion      waxing with your own gang at home, let me tell you how it's      done.<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT YOU'LL NEED<br /></strong><br />      <br />      First, of course, you'll need a supply of onions. Choose      some that are already sprouting and others that have yet to      put forth shoots, and try to collect a variety of sizes and      shapes. When waxed, onions take as little as a few days or      as long as a couple of weeks to sprout . . . an unknown      that adds suspense to watching your creatures when you've      finished making them.<br />      <br />      It'll take about a pound of melted paraffin (or old candles      or crayons) to coat 10 to 20 onions, depending on their      sizes. You can use crayons as a main ingredient of the      melt, or add just a small number of them to color the wax.      You'll also have to round up a metal container large enough      to accommodate an onion and a melted bar of paraffin or its      equivalent. Because wax can be rather difficult to remove      from a pan, I suggest using a two-pound coffee can or a      similar container that you can set aside to be used solely      for this project. In addition, you'll need a saucepan      that's big enough to hold the can in several inches of      water. <em>Never</em> melt paraffin in a container that's      set directly over a heat source, as the wax has a very low      flash point and may catch fire.    </p>        <p>      Next, gather the decorating materials. Your choices for the      trimmings are limited only by the range of your      imagination. Broom straws, fibers, acrylic and tempera      paints, ribbon, and plastic or natural flowers are just      some of the items you may want to use. Other materials      you'll want to have on hand are old aluminum pie pans or      foil on which to set the dipped onions, inexpensive      watercolor brushes for painting designs, and allpurpose      glue for attaching hair, ribbons, and the like.<br />      <br />      <strong>TAKE A DIP</strong><br />      <br />      Once the materials are gathered, strip the outer, paperlike      layers from the vegetables until you get to a firm surface      that will hold wax.<br />      <br />      Next, place the coffee can (or whatever) in a pan of water      and melt the paraffin, old candles, or crayons over medium      heat. If you intend to use crayons just to tint the wax,      let the paraffin or candles melt down completely before you      add the coloring. Then remove the container from the heat.    </p>        <p>      To dip an onion, hold it by its tip or sprout and lower it      into the wax. When the surface is coated all over, remove      it and allow the wax to harden for several seconds. Repeat      this operation 10 or 12 times, or until a thick layer has      been built up (you may need to reheat the wax during this      dipping process). Then, to form a flat base on which the      onion can stand, set it on a level surface (here's where an      aluminum pie pan comes in handy) for a while after each of      a few final dips.<br />      <br />      Now comes the fun part: decorating. If you plan to add      adornments that must adhere to the wax, such as eyes or      whiskers, you'll need to do the work quickly, before the      coating hardens. Other methods of      decorating-painting, for instance-work well      after the wax has set up. And if by any chance you create a      "monster" that you don't care to keep, simply peel of the      wax, remelt it, and start anew, using the same onion.<br />      <br />      This simple craft adds a welcome twist to our clan's      rainy-day activities . . . and I think your family will      agree that it's a pastime worth reviving.    </p>
