                    <p>      <em>Here's a butchering technique that can help you cut an      intimidating job down to size.</em>    </p><h5 id="byline">by David Harper</h5>    <p>      My first successful big-game hunt came at the age of 14. I      learned then how to field-dress and skin a deer, but I      wasn't quite ready to take on the formidable task of      butchering such a large animal. (Besides, the Thanksgiving      holiday was over by the time I got home from the hunt, and      I was due to return to my duties as an eighth-grade      delinquent.) So after I'd properly prepared the      field-dressed carcass by removing the hide, head, and lower      legs, my dad hauled it to the neighborhood butcher, who      cooled it in his meat locker for a few days, then converted      it into neatly wrapped and marked packages of meat . . .      all for the very fair price of 3 cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      Things have changed over the quarter of a century that has      elapsed since that first hunt, and these days, in the      Colorado Rockies where I live, it would cost me more than      <em>ten</em> times as much to have a deer or other biggame      animal processed professionally.<br />      <br />      So I don't.<br />      <br />      Instead, I do it myself. Have been for several years now.      And so can you. I'll tell you how . . . but first, take a      few minutes to study Figs. 1 and 2 and read the      accompanying brief description of professional butchering      techniques. That way, you'll be in a better position to see      how my somewhat unorthodox method differs from the      norm.<br />      <br />      Let me begin by drawing a couple of broad generalizations:      In general, professional-style butchering involves      producing cuts of meat that look like those you're used to      seeing in the grocer's meat cooler . . . T-bone steaks with      those T-shaped bones right there where they should be, for      instance. But to produce such aesthetic cuts of meat takes      skill and a lot of tedious back-and-forthing with a bone      saw: A task that a professional butcher, working in a      commercial meat-processing shop, can whiz through in a      matter of seconds with a powerful electric band saw would      take you or me a good deal longer to accomplish by hand.      What's more, unless you're careful and have at least a      smattering of knowledge about what you're doing, you're      likely to wind up with bone dust polluting those      hard-earned steaks.<br />      <br />      My butchering technique is totally different: I remove the      meat from the bones. That eliminates the time- and      energy-consuming sawing chores, but at the same time      produces some rather odd-looking cuts. (Visualize a T-bone      steak with the T deleted and you'll have an idea of what I      mean.) Of course, they taste every bit as good as their      professional-looking counterparts-and, what's more,      they take up less space in my cramped deep freeze.<br />      <br />      Fact is, I'm proud of my no-bones butchering style, and      I've had such good results with it over the past several      years that I wouldn't consider attempting a more      complicated method. But before I begin explaining how you      can duplicate it, I reckon it's only fair to own up to how      I "discovered" it: Truth is, my technique was born out of      an equal blend of desperation and ignorance.<br />      <br />      The very first hour of the very first morning of my very      first elk hunt, I got lucky. My luck held through the day,      as I was fortunate enough to talk a local outfitter into      lending me one of his mules to pack the horsesize bull elk      down from his mountaintop domain. But once I got my trophy      home, it began to look as if my luck had run out.<br />      <br />      There I was, the proud owner of 600 or so pounds of elk      carcass that needed to find its way into a freezer pronto .      . . and me without a spare $120, which is what it would      have cost to have the meat processed commercially at the      then going rate of 20 cents a pound (it's since gone up to      35 cents a pound). And to make things even more      interesting, even though I'd been hunting deer since my      earliest teenage years, I'd never butchered one myself.      Hadn't even watched someone else do it. Worse yet, since      big-game hunting season is a national holiday in my neck of      the Colorado woods (they even let school out for two      days!), every last do-it-yourself butchering book in the      public library had already been checked out by the time I      got there.<br />      <br />      So I did what I had to do. I pulled a picnic table into the      shed where that big old bull elk was hanging to cool. I      assembled my knives, bone saw, sharpening implements,      wrapping paper, marking pen, and freezer tape. Then, with      my old yaller scrap-eating dog standing by to assist, I set      to it.<br />      <br />      It took me four full days of finger-numbing work to get the      job done (the shed wasn't heated, and neither was the elk).      The results weren't recognizable as anything you could put      a name on ("Where's the T-bones?" my wife wanted to know),      and I'm sure I wasted some meat in the process of      amateurish experimentation and on-the-job training (much to      my dog's delight). But by golly, I wound up with several      hundred pounds of lean, top-quality meat in the freezer,      that $120 still in my bank account rather than the      butcher's, and best of all, the satisfaction of having      overcome what four days earlier had seemed an      insurmountable obstacle: my own ignorance.<br />      <br />      Since that first time I've home-butchered another elk (the      second one took only two days) and several deer (a day      each), and worked most of the bugs out of the      technique.<br />      <br />      I'll lay out the basics of it for you here, and I predict      that you'll be as satisfied with the results of your first      attempt as I was with mine.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CUTTING IT DOWN TO SIZE</strong><br />      <br />      Glance at the illustrations for a moment. Notice how      geometric everything is? With this standard technique, you      start by splitting the carcass in <em>half,</em> then go on      to <em>quarter</em> it, making <em>straight</em> cuts      through the body, slicing through muscle and sawing through      bone with no real concern for the way the various parts      were assembled by nature to form a mobile creature. (There      are actually six "quarters," including the midsection, but      <em>quartering</em> is still what it's called.)<br />      <br />      Well, if you opt to try "my" method (I seriously doubt that      I'm the first to discover such a butchering technique), you      most definitely will be giving some thought to the animal's      anatomy . . . because you'll literally be dissecting the      carcass-taking it apart limb by limb and muscle group      by muscle group.<br />      <br />      The biggest muscles (actually, <em>groups</em> of muscles      bound together in membranous sacs)-especially those      located in the shoulders and hindquarters-look almost      like elongated footballs. These, my fellow meat cutters,      are nothing more than Mother Nature's prepackaged roasts.      If some of them are too big for single roasts, simply slice      through the middle, across the grain of the meat, to divide      each of the biggies into two smaller roasts. Do you want      steaks? Keep slicing <em>(always</em> across the grain) to      convert a single roast into a multitude of custom-cut      steaks, as thick or as thin as you like.<br />      <br />      But what about all those other muscle bundles that      <em>aren't</em> shaped like roasts-like the long, narrow      bands that wrap around the legs above the knee joints? And      those wide slabs that cover the breastplate? Well, that's      pretty much up to you; if it looks like meat for steak,      then slice it into appropriate-size layers and      <em>call</em> it steak. And if it doesn't look good enough      for such a high-sounding designation as "steak" or even      "steak chunks," then earmark it for stew or soup chunks, or      to be ground into burger.<br />      <br />      Here's how I go about it.<br />      <br />      Start by slicing down through the meat (cutting      <em>between</em> muscle bundles rather than through them as      much as possible) to the joint of a front shoulder, then      cut through the joint with a bone saw. (On smaller animals      you can often separate the joint without the aid of a saw.)      Lay this front quarter out on your butchering table and      study it a moment before doing any more cutting.<br />      <br />      Sure, those muscle bundles are interwoven with all sorts of      over- and underpasses, intersections, and tunnels to get      lost in. But if you begin with the most obvious and      easy-to-identify bundles first, you'll gradually find your      way through the maze. Any big "football" muscles you can      get out of the top of the shoulder should be set aside as      blade roasts. As you work down the leg, though, the muscles      will get longer and thinner, and thus less prime; I usually      toss such cuts into a pile that, when it begins to grow      fairly large, I divide into several smaller piles according      to quality and intended use, then wrap and mark them as      destined for burger, stew and soup chunks, jerky, or dog      scraps.<br />      <br />      Want to mark your packages of meat with something more      descriptive than "roast," "steak," or "stew chunks"? It's      as simple as studying the drawings and labeling your cuts      with the name of the area from which they      <em>came-"round steak,"</em> " <em>rump</em> roast,"      etc.<br />      <br />      Here's a special tip for hunters: Always trim any fat from      wild-game meat before you wrap and freeze it. While fat      adds tenderness and a delicious flavor to domestic beef      (especially if the steer was grain-fed for a few weeks      before slaughtering), the white, tallow-like stuff on game      animals is the repository of much of the strong taste often      attributed to wild meat. Cut it off. Throw it away. (If you      find the meat too lean for your family's tastes, sweeten it      up by adding beef suet, an inexpensive substance available      at any butcher shop and many grocery meat counters.)<br />      <br />      <strong>MOVING RIGHT ALONG</strong><br />      <br />      I suggested that you start with a front quarter not only      because it's smaller and easier to work with than a more      massive hindquarter, but also because the meat from the      fore part of the body is generally less valuable. That way,      if you mess up your first few attempts to skillfully      extract those muscle bundles, the loss won't be so      great.<br />      <br />      And now, since you have a leg up on experience, front leg      number two will go faster, your cuts will be prettier, your      mutilated-meat pile will be smaller . . . and your dog will      be disappointed.<br />      <br />      Now for the hindquarters. Again, they're bigger, and the      meat tends to be of a much higher quality-but so far      as procedures go, it's just more of the same . . . remove a      quarter by cutting between muscle bundles as much as      possible (rather than through them), saw through the hip      joint, then dissect the leg and rump into as many      identifiable muscle groups as possible, and designate      what's left as different grades of nonprime meat.<br />      <br />      Your deer (or whatever) is now a mere shadow of its former      self-but the choicest cuts of all are yet to come,      and with all the practice you've just had butchering the      four quarters, you shouldn't have any trouble getting these      valuable portions out intact. Refer once again to the      figures, focusing your attention on the top portion of the      midsection, called the loin. See that more or less      triangular strip of meat that runs alongside the spine, on      the outside of the rib cage? That's the good stuff . . .      the backstrap.<br />      <br />      To butcher out this premium cut, first run your knife down      each side of the spine, cutting deep enough to contact the      ribs. Now cut in horizontally, so that the two cuts meet at      the bottom outside of the spine-which should liberate      a triangular strip of meat varying in length according to      the size of the animal. Repeat the procedures on the other      side of the backbone to free the companion backstrap.<br />      <br />      H ow look up inside the body cavity (you can open the rib      cage by sawing up the middle of the sternum, if you haven't      already done so): See those two long, round bundles of      meat, one running along either side of the backbone?      They're also good stuff... the tenderloins. Strip them out      carefully and guard them and the backstraps with your life      (watch that sneaky dog!). You can cut them into thick      steaks before wrapping and freezing, or package them in      longer sections and wait to do the final cutting just      before broiling or charcoaling. (My philosophy is "save the      best for right now"; consequently, a tenderloin has yet to      last long enough around my house to make it to the      freezer.)<br />      <br />      Now stand back and survey what's left of the carcass. Not a      lot there . . . a neck attached by a length of spine to two      big sides of ribs, plus small bits of meat here and there,      mostly stuck in hard-to-get-at places along the backbone,      hip, and shoulder joints.<br />      <br />      But waste not, want not. There's no need to cut the neck      off-just bone out the meat and mark it for the chili      pot. Next, separate the two racks of ribs from the spine by      sawing or cleaving, then divide them into freezing- and      serving-size portions by slicing between every few ribs.      (However, since deer ribs don't hold much meat in the first      place, and removing the backstraps and tenderloin takes the      best of what there is, you may opt to earmark the ribs for      your four-legged friends and thus dispense with the      necessity of dividing, packaging, and freezing those      cuts.)<br />      <br />      Finally, use a small knife to strip the skeleton of every      last bit of edible meat.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SOUNDS EASY . . .</strong><br />      <br />      And it is. The "secret" of this technique, again, is taking      the animal apart more or less the way it was put together.      And when you're finished, you'll have the justifiable pride      of the self-sufficient, a freezer full of custom-butchered      meat . . . and a smiling dog with a weight problems    </p>    <h3>Coming up...</h3>    <p>      <em>In</em> <em>MOTHER NO. 91,</em> <em>David Harper will      conclude his three-part series on biggame and midsize      livestock processing (which began in</em> <em>MOTHER N0.      89</em> <em>with field-dressing and skinning techniques)      with a look at the tools of the butcher's trade, an      overview of sharpening implements, and a discussion of      knife-sharpening techniques.</em>    </p>

Each half is then divided into hindquarter, midsection, and forequarter. Each of these three main sections can then be butchered into large portions, as labeled above.
