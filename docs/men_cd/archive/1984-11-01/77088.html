                                        <p>      Two of its names are star of the earth and blessed herb.      Herba benedicta, blessed herb, and herb bennet are names      that have been given to several plants with healing      virtues, but perhaps to none more deserving than Geum      urbanum, or wood avens, a shy wayside herb of      undistinguished appearance found in the British Isles,      Europe, and Asia. Although it's found wild in North America      only in areas where it has "escaped" from cultivation, wood      avens is similar to several native plants (yellow avens,      cream-colored avens, and rough avens, for example), some of      which share its medicinal properties.<br />      <br />      In the field of green remedies, wood avens holds its own.      An infusion of the clove-scented rootstock is said to      induce sleep, and a decoction of half an ounce of the root      boiled in a pint of water, strained, cooled, and then drunk      in wineglassful doses three or four times a day has been      prescribed as an antidote to chills, ague, hemor rhages,      and headaches. As a gargle, the decoction is traditionally      used to combat halitosis and gum problems. As a tea, it's      supposed to ease diarrhea, sore throat, and chronic      bronchial catarrh. As a culinary herb, wood avens appears      to have been used only to flavor ale and apple tarts; but      the fragrant root, placed among household linens, acts as a      sachet and moth repellant.<br />      <br />      A perennial, wood avens grows one to two feet high. Its'      erect, hairy stem, reddish at the bottom, supports      five-part lower leaves and three-part upper ones. Bright      yellow, star-shaped flowers about three-quarters of an inch      in diameter grace the plant throughout the summer (in      England, the herb blossoms into autumn and may even flow er      in December). The root is finger-thick, anywhere from one      to three inches long, with a yellow-to-brown outer coat and      a pinkish or pink-violet interior. According to some      authorities, the root should be harvested from dry ground      in springtime: A few old-timers insisted that March 25 was      the "proper" date. Since much of the spicy odor can be lost      in the drying process, dehydration must be gradual. The      beneficial properties of the root are said to keep best      when it is dried whole, then sliced and powdered as      needed.<br />      <br />      Thriving in ordinary garden soil and preferring semishade,      wood avens is easy to grow. You can gather its seeds from      plants in the wild (but be sure to take the smallest amount      possible, disturbing the area the least you can) and then      sow them in boxes or in a frame. Transplant the young      seedlings to a selected garden spot in July.<br />      <br />      Insignificant though it may appear, wood avens is a      much-loved herb. At least one authority believed that the      term herb bennet was a derivation of St. Benedict's herb, a      name given to many plants thought to have antidotal      properties. In addition to enjoying a reputed power against      the plague, wood avens was said to fend off evil spirits      and venomous beasts. It was thought to protect the home and      was at one time worn as an amulet against Satan.<br />      <br />      Happier folklore, however, said that the trefoil leaves      symbolized the Holy Trinity, while the five petals      represented the five wounds of Christ. Star of the earth,      some have called it, bringing to mind the joy and promise      of the Christmas season.    </p>
