                    <h5 id="byline">      by Richard C. Banfield    </h5>    <p>      To many folks, changing the tires on a vehicle means a      biannual trip to the local shop to swap snow treads for      some summer tires, and perhaps a jaunt or two to pick up a      newly patched flat. However-as anyone in the country can      attest-changing punctured tires (say on that old      workhorse pickup) can be a time-consuming chore when the      nearest service station is a considerable distance      away.<br />      <br />      One summer, having spent what seemed an inordinate amount      of time (and gas money) toting tattered tires to town and      back, I vowed to eliminate this unnecessary expense . . .      and came up with the idea of building a manual tire      changer. My homemade tool-which is fashioned after      the machine-shop models, with a few minor alterations      incorporated into the design-has proved to be just      the ticket for my tire-changing needs. And I'll wager that      it would come in handy for other country folks, as well.    </p>        <p>      <strong>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</strong><br />      <br />      To construct the tire changer, you'll need some fundamental      metalworking skills (including knowledge of welding, torch      work, and basic fabricating) and the following tools: a      drill with 3/8", 27/64", 1/2", and 5/8" highspeed bits, an      oxyacetylene torch, a welder, a grinder, a 1/2"-13 tap, a      tape measure, a hammer, and a pipe wrench (for leverage).      And, although they're not necessary, an assortment of hole      saws and a metal-cutting band saw <em>will</em> make your      job easier.<br />      <br />      Most of the tire changer's components can probably be      fashioned from odds and ends around your shop, or (of      course) you can buy the materials from a local scrapyard or      steel supplier. Even though I purchased much of my metal      from a welding shop, my tally for the tool came to just      under $30 . . . and your total-even if you bought all      of the material new-shouldn't come to much more than      that. Furthermore, my device paid for itself in convenience      in its first few uses . . . and your tool could even      provide you with a bit of extra cash (or barter credit) if      you offered its services to friends and neighbors. (A word      of caution here, though: Don't try to change any      fancy-rimmed tires until you're certain of your skill!)    </p>        <p>      <strong>METALWORKING MASTERY<br /></strong><br />      As you can see from the accompanying drawing and list of      materials, I made my tire changer by cutting, bending,      bolting, and/or welding various sizes of Schedule 40 pipe,      steel plate, and flat stock. The main assembly consists of      a 1/4" X 18"-diameter baseplate . . . a 1-1/2" X 40-3/4"      Schedule 40 pipe stanchion . . . three 1/8" X 2" X 2" X 14"      angle iron braces . . . a tire rest, cut and bent to the      shape shown . . . and a mount-and-socket lug-pin apparatus.      The "accessories" for the tire changer include a centering      hub, which positions the to-be-changed tire . . . a snug      plate, which holds the hub in place . . . a break-down      assembly . . . and a beading tool.<br />      <br />      Because the tire changer will have to be secured to the      floor of your workshop, you'll need to drill three 3/8"      holes, each about 1-1/2" in from the outer edge of the      baseplate, to accommodate the anchoring bolts. And, in      order to be able to accommodate various tire sizes, you'll      also need six 5/8" holes, located on 2" centers, in the      stanchion . . . with the first bore 4" below the top of the      pipe. Once those holes are drilled, you can weld the base,      stanchion, and angle braces in place.<br />      <br />      To fashion the tire rest, cut a 3" X 3" X 6" X 6"      kite-shaped section from each corner of a 1/4" X 18" X 21"      steel plate, then-using the largest tip of your      oxyacetylene torch-heat the metal to a cherry red      and, with a pipe wrench and a section of pipe for leverage,      bend the sides down until the corners mesh together to      create a 5-1/2" X 10" platform. (For a smoother look, you      can weld the joints together; however, the mount will be      sufficiently sturdy as is.) Next, cut a hole in the center      of the tire rest to accommodate the 1-1/2" stanchion, and,      from one side of that same opening, cut a 1-1/4" X 3" slot      for the lug pin.<br />      <br />      The lug pin-a 1" X 5-3/4" piece of hotrolled rod      that's tapered (using a grinder) for the first 1-1/2" so      that it will fit into a tire's lug bolt hole-sits      within the lug-pin socket atop a 3" spring, which in turn      rests on a 3/8" X 2-1/2" machine bolt that fastens that      swiveling 1"X 6" section of Schedule 40 pipe to two 1/8" X      1-1/2" X 2-1/4" mounting plates. It really isn't as      complicated as it sounds. Once the lug-pin socket mounts      are welded in place 24" below the top of the stanchion, you      can weld the tire rest into position 6" above the      mounts.<br />      <br />      With the main assembly together, turn your attention to      fashioning the accessories. To make the centering hub, cut      a 2" hole in the middle of the 1/4" X 6"-diameter plate,      then simply weld the collar and braces to this metal      doughnut. Next, form the snug plate by cutting a 1/2" X 4"      X 6" section of steel plate into a football shape, and then      boring a 2" hole in its center. Measure in 1" from each of      the two longer ends of the ellipse, and drill and tap      1/2"-13 holes for the 1/2" X 2-1/2" tightening bolts.      (NOTE: When fashioning the snug plate or any of the other      parts that call for 1/2" steel plate, keep in mind that you      can use two welded-together sections of 1/4" metal if you      don't have the thicker-and more      expensive-material on hand.)<br />      <br />      Next, you'll need an L-pin, which will fit into the holes      in the stanchion. To make one, heat and bend a 7" piece of      1/2" hot-rolled rod to form two 2-1/2" and 4-1/2"      perpendicular legs.<br />      <br />      To make the break-down assembly, drill two 1/2" holes, one      3-3/4" from the end and the other 3/4" from the opposite      end, in <em>each</em> of the two 1/4" X 2" X 8" mounting      plates . . . bore another 1/2" hole 3/4" from one end of      the swing arm . . . and drill yet another 1/2" hole 3/4"      from one end of the offset arm. Next, form the breaker shoe      by cutting and bending a piece of 1/4" X 2" X 9" flat stock      to fit the contour of a tire rim, as shown. Then weld on      the gussets and swing arm, and grind them smooth to conform      with the curve of the breaker shoe. With that done, weld      the pipe collar to the offset arm, and bolt the swing arm      and offset arm to the two mounting plates. Finally, insert      the flattened end of the 1 " X 16" (or longer) break-down      handle approximately 1" into the mounts, andafter you've      made sure that the swing arm will still pivot freely-weld      it into place.<br />      <br />      The beading tool is fashioned out of 1-1/4" X 30"-or      longer-Schedule 40 pipe that's been tapered for      4-1/2" on one end. The opposite end of the pipe is also      flattened slightly so that it can more easily accept a      weldedon 1/4" X 1-1/2" X 3-1/2" section of flat stock,      which is hammered into a hook (see the enlarged diagram). A      triangular bead guide, cut from 1/2" X 1" X 2-1/2" flat      stock and welded to the back of the hook, completes the      tool.    </p>    <p><strong>THE EN-TIRE TECHNIQUE</strong></p>        <p>      My tire changer works on the same      principle as do the machine-shop models. To remove a tire      from its rim, place it-valve side up-on the      metal rest and fit the lug pin into the tire's lug bolt      hole. The centering hub is positioned next, and on top of      that piece sits the snug plate. With those parts in place,      fit the L-pin in the nearest stanchion hole, and then      adjust the tightening bolts to secure the rim in place. At      this point, remove the valve from the tire.<br />      <br />      Now you can set the real workhorse of the machine in      action. Place the break-down assembly so that the breaker      shoe sits next to the tire's rim, and then simply press      down on the handle and "walk" the tool around the tire to      break the bead. Then flip the tire over and repeat the      procedure on the other side.<br />      <br />      Next, insert the tapered end of the beading tool between      the rim and the tire, use that lever to flip the bead      <em>above</em> the metal lip, then walk the handle around      until the edge of the tire rests on top of the rim. If your      tire just needs a patched or replaced tube, you should be      able to fix it while the tire rests on the mount, but if      you need to free the tire, you'll have to flip it over and      repeat this sequence.<br />      <br />      To put the repaired tire back on the rim, hook the      <em>curved</em> end of the beading tool between the tire      and the rim, and push down on the bead guide to pop the      rubber under the rim. Then pump the good-as-new tire full      of air . . . and get ready to roll!<br />      <br />    </p>
