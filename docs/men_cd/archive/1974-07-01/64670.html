                		<hr />    <p>      <strong>MOTHER</strong> has received several letters      indicating that the amount of power reported available with      the Savonius Super Rotor ( <strong>MOTHER NO.</strong> 26,      pp. 78-80; NO. 27, pg. 39) was much higher than is actually      possible with this type of unit.    </p>    <p>      With the kind assistance of William Vance, Advanced      Concepts Division of Science Applications, Inc., La Jolla,      California, and with the aid of Mark's Mechanical      Engineer's Handbook, we have calculated values for the      amount of power produced by the S-rotor. The following is      the method used and the results.    </p>						<p>		S- Rotor design and operation is still an experimental field. But 		these power equations are as close as possible to the expecte output... 		enough to act as a guide for design. For instance, if one desired a 1,000-watt output in 		a 15 mph wind (requiring a Stuart of 7.7-ft radius), the S-rotor dimensions would be: 	 </p>            <p>      In general, the S-rotor appears convenient for situations      with smaller power requirements where its size is      manageable... Elektro GmbH of Switzerland produces a      250-watt and a 500-watt model, but uses the familiar      three-bladed Stuart for higher-powered models, 1,000 watts      and up. But any situation is unique in its wind      characteristics, power requirements, topography and      available materials and skills, and each factor should be      considered in deciding the best windplant to erect    </p>    <p>      John Boll<br />      Director of Research and Development    </p>
