                    		<h5 class="byline">		by Marj Watkins		</h5>    <p>      "After thirty," says the proverb, "you're either a fool or      your own physician." Maybe before thirty, too especially if      you live in an isolated spot and or have a big bump of      independence. Of course, you're a bigger fool still if you      meddle with a serious or persistent condition but both you      and your overworked doctor will be better off if you can      prevent or cure your own minor ills. Over the next few      issues of MOTHER, Marj Watkins will be passing on some      health hints that work for her family.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"Kitchen medicine" is my family's system of      natural healing</em></strong> : the right food for every      physical condition, plus home remedies, plus exercises to      exercise aches, plus vitamin therapy.    </p>    <p>      We believe that by immediately eating, doing and taking the      right simple things as soon as we first notice minor      symptoms, we can avert or prevent major illnesses. Kitchen      medicine saves us money we might have had to spend on      doctors' and dentists' bills and prescriptions and the time      we might have wasted in physicians' offices and drugstores      goes into happy living and creative work.    </p>    <p>      Another point in favor of our natural remedies is      that-sensibly applied, they can do us nothing but good. On      the other hand, even such a seemingly innocent      pharmaceutical as aspirin can cause an upset stomach or      internal bleeding and stronger drugstore or prescription      medicines have more severe potential side effects.    </p>    <p>      Part of our kitchen medicine is family lore, handed down      from the proven store of a quick-witted, innovative      grandmother except that we've replaced some of her cures      with others that are as effective and more pleasant. We no      longer paint sore throats with iodine or blow boric acid      powder into them, for instance, and the dread enema is just      an unpleasant memory.    </p>    <p>      For other herbal remedies and hints on what to eat when and      what to do (or not do) in case of various ailments, we're      indebted to Oregon and Washington Indians, Adelle Davis,      Euell Gibbons and the U.S. Department of Agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Here-in more or less alphabetical order are some common      disorders and the measures we've used to cope with them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACHES AND PAINS</strong><br />      The amount of pain we feel is related to the amounts of      calcium and vitamin E stored in our bodies. When both are      present in plenty we experience less discomfort, and fear      it less. Two calcium lactate tablets with a glass of milk      four times a day for a couple of days before going to have      teeth drilled or pulled should send you to the dentist      feeling calm and brave.    </p>    <p>      To forestall back and joint pains and muscle cramps, eat      daily some of these calcium-rich foods: broccoli, chard,      lamb's quarters, collard, dandelion, mustard or turnip      greens, whole wheat and soy flours, rice, sesame seeds and      torula yeast.    </p>    <p>      You can also extract calcium from meat bones: Simmer any      you can get with water to cover, a tablespoon or two of      vinegar to leach out minerals, an onion sliced and lightly      stir-fried in oil, a handful of sliced celery, a few      peppercorns, a tablespoon of dried seaweed, marjoram and or      basil and a few slices of carrot plus a teaspoon of salt.      Bring the potful to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer      everything covered one to three hours. You can serve the      broth in cups with a dash of tamari (fermented soy sauce)      or use the stock as a base for a more elaborate soup or      stew.    </p>    <p>      Vitamin E you can get from any whole grain (cooked slowly      and gently), from bean sprouts, cold-pressed unrefined oils      and in capsules or chewable tablets (most effective in the      form of d-alpha-tocopherol). Adelle Davis recommends in her      books that adults begin with 100 units daily for the first      week, and work up to 600 units daily.    </p>    <p>      Ian F. Rose, father of Olympic swimmer Murray Rose, says      his athlete son takes 200 to 1,500 units of vitamin E a day      as stress and activity indicate plus wheat germ, wheat germ      oil and rice bran.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HEAT TREATMENT:</strong> Even the warmth of a human      hand applied to an aching knee, back or neck can be very      comforting. Take a hot shower with the water directed at      the troublesome part, or soak in a hot bath with a      tablespoon or two each of sage and thyme leaves in a tea      ball (or stuffed into a swatch of cheesecloth fastened with      a rubber band or twist-tie).    </p>    <p>      Apply a cloth wrung out of hot vinegar solution (one      tablespoon of vinegar to a quart of water) to aching      joints, or soak arthritic hands in the same liquid. Dr.      D.C. Jarvis, author of <em>Arthritis and Folk Medicine</em>      , claims that the acid is able to penetrate the skin and      put the calcium deposited in the finger joints back into      the bloodstream. Anyway, the moist heat is beneficial.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXERCISE:</strong> For backache: Lie on a      well-padded floor, wrap your arms around your knees and use      your curved back as a rocker.    </p>    <p>      For leg joints: Apply a heating pad or hot moist pack, then      stretch and bend. Walk until you reach a stride that      doesn't hurt. The first few minutes may be painful after      that the joints loosen up. Stop before fatigue tightens      them again.    </p>    <p>      For fingers, wrist and arm: Apply heat treatment and limber      by stretching and bending.    </p>    <p>      For ankle joints: Soak the feet in hot water deep enough to      cover the ankles. Balance a beanbag on your foot as you sit      in a chair and raise and lower the weight five times. Very      gradually increase the number of repetitions (one more each      day is enough),    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEEP REST:</strong> Lie comfortably on your back,      hands on chest, in the Egyptian mummy pose. Inhale fully,      count to yourself as far as you can on one breath and      exhale slowly and completely. Then pause for a few counts      before another slow, smooth inhalation. At each end of each      breath your body has some moments when not even breathing      jars it. Repeat the exercise five times, breathe normally      for a little while and start again. Do this for five to      fifteen minutes, several times daily and before going to      sleep at night.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Copyright Â© 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
