                    <h5 id="byline">      by DONALD W. GEARY    </h5>        <p>      House painting is such a monumental task that most people      don't know where to begin . . . or, if they do know, they      don't want to hassle with getting paint all over themselves      or spend their weekends or vacations perched on top of a      ladder. And that's where I come in.    </p>    <p>      Last spring I placed an advertisement in a suburban news      paper: "House Painting-reasonable and efficient, free      estimate-call _____. " The notice cost me $1.60 a      week and brought in about five weekly inquiries from      prospect ive customers. This was the start of a profitable      business.    </p>    <p>      When I receive a call I make an appointment to visit the      prospective client as soon as possible. My rule is to      explain to the homeowner at our first meeting that I'm not      a professional painter, but have experience and believe I      can do a good job. It's always best to be up front with      people . . . they appreciate knowing that they'll have      satisfactory work done at a price below the going rate.    </p>    <p>      My next move is to walk around the house and get a clear      picture of what's needed. This survey includes some basic      questions: Will there be a significant color change? Are      there any areas in need of repair (broken leaders and      gutter, rotten wood, etc.)? Will the owner take care of      these problems, or will I? (I always state whether or not      I'm qualified to do so.) Does the customer want one coat of      paint, or two? (The first goes on slowly, the second more      easily because the covered surface is smoother and less      absorbent.)    </p>    <p>      I also ask at this point whether the homeowner can supply      an extension ladder (either his own or one borrowed from a      neighbor). Most often he can, but if not I arrange to      borrow or rent one. A good ladder costs about $185, which      is why I don't have my own even though I've painted over 25      houses.    </p>    <p>      When I'm making an estimate I carry a clipboard and pad      with me and make notes about the job: approximate hours and      cost, date to begin and any special instructions (remove      storm windows, put up screens, paint both, clean gutters,      etc.).    </p>    <p>      My estimate is based on a window count (because the frames      are the most time-consuming areas to paint, what with the      detail and the care that's needed to avoid smearing the      glass). Each window-and every door-goes down on      my sheet as one hour . . . and if extensive putty      replacement is needed I allot extra time. Then I figure      about three hours for the long side of a house, one to      three for railings and porches (depending on length and      type) and variable periods for trim according to its      nature. Individual homes vary so much that rigid scheduling      isn't possible, but my rough guides work out pretty      accurately in practice.    </p>    <p>      These calculations give me an overall time      estimate-one to three days-which I multiply by      my hourly rate. When I employ a helper, I add his hourly      pay to mine and then multiply.    </p>    <p>      The amount you charge should be fair to both the homeowner      and to you. If you have some experience I'd recommend      asking a minimum of $4.00 per hour. Raise your charge as      you improve, but never compromise yourself by demanding the      exorbitant rip-off rates of commercial painters. I don't      buy paint unless the customer insists, since I prefer to      have him or her select the grade and colors . . . but I do      urge the individual to go for the best he can afford. If I      must supply the materials, I stick with a good brand such      as Benjamin Moore, Dutch Boy, Sherwin-Williams or Sears.      I'm particular because I know that the quality of the paint      will directly affect the quality of my work . . . not that      sloppy workmanship with good materials equals a      professional job, of course, but cheap products won't look      good or last long no matter how they're used.    </p>    <p>      Two basic types of paint are available: oil-based and      water-based (latex). Modern methods of production have      improved the durability of latex to the point that it      actually surpasses the oil type. I prefer a water-based      formula myself, for several reasons: It dries in about one      hour so that two coats can be applied the same day, it's      easier to handle and stroke on and the brushes clean up      with soap and water.    </p>    <p>      If you're going into the painting business, it's a good      idea to visit a few dealers to get paint charts and find      out about the available products, their prices, methods of      application and expected life (which can vary from three to      ten years).    </p>    <p>      Most house-painting jobs consist of four major tasks. The      first is surface preparation, which can entail anything up      to removing all the old paint or replacing parts of the      structure. In most cases, though, what's involved is some      scraping, sanding and caulking with maybe a bit of priming      here and there. The whole business should take about half a      day for the average home and-if done wel--will      give you a good base for the work which is to follow.      Remember, paint won't adhere properly unless the underlying      area is free of dirt and loose coatings.    </p>    <p>      I usually begin by hosing down the outside of a house to      remove most of the soil. Then I scrape any peeling, cracked      or chipped spots. Areas which have been taken down to the      bare wood get a splash of primer (or two coats of regular      paint will suffice if the patch is small). Finally, 1      replace any loose or missing putty around windows and      recaulk window frames, doors and chimneys where needed.    </p>    <p>      The second major task is to paint the trim and windows. The      trim is usually simple unless the house is an old one with      overhanging eaves. In that case you'll be reaching overhead      (wear a hat) and using muscles that will be sore for a      while. Care with the windows saves time in the long run      because you won't have to go back later and scrape the      panes.    </p>    <p>      Then comes the main body of the house . . . the easiest      part because you can use a wide brush and make long      strokes. (Just don't overextend your reach when you're      standing on a ladder!) For large, smooth areas I often use      an industrial roller, a bushy affair that holds a lot of      paint and in most cases will cover as well as a brush . . .      with the added benefit of almost supersonic speed. I've      finished an entire home-excluding windows-in      one day using a roller and extension rod. I'd suggest,      though, that you stick with a brush until you get really      good.    </p>    <p>      The last task is to clean up the area around the house, by      gathering up any stray paint chips, old caulking and putty      and throwing them away. At the same time I survey the      completed work and touch up any spots I missed or didn't      cover well. I know that if I'm satisfied the homeowner will      be happy too, and that's good advertising.    </p>    <p>      What I've told you is basically all there is to house      painting (except that it's nice to have a good companion at      home to massage your tired muscles). This skill is helping      me earn money to get back to the land and-even after      I'm there-should bring me some bucks for things I      might otherwise have to do without. If you're planning a      break-or have already made one-and you're short      of cash . . . think about financing part of your new life      with a paintbrush!    </p>
