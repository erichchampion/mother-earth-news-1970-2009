    <meta name="description" content="July/August 1974 | If you really want to help Keep America Beautiful . . . learn the house-painting business! Youll find, as I did, that the venture can bring you a good income and many fringe benefits: outdoor work, varied location, a choice of hours and plenty of chances to meet new and interesting people. Youll also have the satisfaction of performing a valuable service. A home, after all, is a lifetime investment, which its owner wants to protect. By Joel Ellis" />

        ABOVE, FROM LEFT: Use a wire hook to hang the bucket of paint on your ladder. If you tote your equipment in boxes... you can stand on the containers as you work! Haul your ladders on a car-top ladder... and don't forget a red flag on the back if they're longer than the vehicle.
