    <p>
                            <p>        Wheat has been called the staff of life. Since before        recorded history, whole civilizations have depended upon        wheat crops as their major source of food, and some        variety of this grain can be grown on almost any arable        land. Wheat contains most essential vitamins and        minerals, but is especially rich in vitamins B-complex        and E. Stone-ground whole wheat flour retains many more        nutrients than either the white variety or the whole        wheat product of modern, commercial milling methods. The        high gluten content of wheat flour makes it better suited        to baking than flours made from other grains.      </p>      <h3>        WHOLE WHEAT BREAD      </h3>      <p>        <em>Wheat for Man . . . Why and How</em> suggests the        following method for making three 2-pound (or four 1-1/2        pound) loaves of whole wheat bread. Dissolve 2 packages        of dry yeast in 1 cup of warm water. In a large mixing        bowl, combine the softened yeast with 1/2 cup oil or        melted shortening, 1/2 cup sugar, honey or molasses, 2        tablespoons of salt and 5 cups of milk (water or potato        water may be substituted)- Gradually add 11 to 12 cups        unsifted whole wheat flour and mix well (the resulting        dough should be quite moist). Let the batter rest 10-15        minutes before kneading it for 10 minutes on a floured        (preferably canvas-covered) board. The dough should then        be refrigerated (covered with foil or a dampened towel)        for 3 to 24 hours and may need to be "punched down" once        or twice. (If dough is to be refrigerated only 3 hours,        the liquid used should be heated to lukewarm. Also, the        kneading may be done <em>after</em> refrigeration if more        convenient.) Take the dough from the refrigerator and let        stand at room temperature (or in 80-85° F oven) 30-60        minutes. Knead 10 minutes if not done previously. Mold        into three or four loaves and place in loaf pans. Lightly        grease the top of each loaf and let rise until almost        doubled. Bake at 325° F for 1 hour 10 minutes to 1        hour 20 minutes.      </p>      <h3>        WHOLE WHEAT MUFFINS      </h3>      <p>        Taken from <em>The New York Times Natural Foods        Cookbook.</em> Sift together into a mixing bowl 3 cups        whole wheat flour, 1/3 cup brown sugar (or raw sugar), 1        teaspoon salt and 4-1/2 teaspoons baking powder. In        another bowl, combine 2 beaten eggs, 1/3 cup melted        butter and 1-1/3 cups milk. Stir egg mixture into the dry        ingredients. Pour into oiled muffin tins, filling to 2/3        full, and bake at 375° F for 20 minutes or until        done. Makes 18 medium muffins.      </p>            <p>        Barley is believed to be among the most ancient of foods        used by the human race and one of the first cultivated        cereals. It grows best in loose, fertile soil in cool,        moist climates. Generally grown to produce grain (which        can be made into malt), it is also used for hay and        pasture. The grain, or barleycorn, contains 8-19% protein        and most (if not all) of the vitamins and minerals        essential to human nutrition. Barley flour is used in        combination with other flours for baking, and the        grain-either whole or pearled-is added to        soups to thicken them. Pearl barley is usually available        at supermarkets and other forms of the grain can be found        in health food stores.      </p>      <p>        BARLEY BREAD      </p>      <p>        The <em>Oats, Peas, Beans & Barley Cookbook</em>        gives the following recipe using barley flour. Measure        into a small bowl 2 tablespoons of yeast and 1 tablespoon        of brown sugar. Heat 2 cups of water to lukewarm        (100° F) and stir enough of the liquid into the yeast        and sugar mixture to dissolve them. Measure out 4-1/2        cups barley flour and put half into a large bowl with the        remaining water. Beat the dough vigorously to incorporate        air and develop gluten, and then stir in 2 teaspoons        salt, 1 tablespoon oil and the softened yeast and sugar.        Add 1/4 cup soy flour and enough barley flour to thicken        the dough until it can be kneaded. Knead until smooth and        elastic, shape into two round loaves and place on cookie        sheet. Cut slashes across the top and let rise until        doubled in size. Bake for 1 hour at 350° F.      </p>      <p>        BARLEY SOUP      </p>      <p>        From <em>The New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook.</em>      </p>      <p>        6 cups beef broth or vegetable broth (vegetable cooking        water)<br />        1/4 cup whole barley, washed<br />        1/4 cup chopped onions<br />        2 cups tomatoes, peeled and chopped<br />        1 cup fresh peas<br />        1/2 cup diced celery<br />        1 cup carrots, sliced<br />        1/2 cup chopped parsley<br />        salt to taste      </p>      <p>        Combine broth and barley in a heavy kettle, cover and        simmer. When barley is tender (about one hour) add        remaining ingredients except parsley. Cook just until        vegetables are done, add parsley and serve. Yields enough        for six.      </p>            <p>        Rye is a grass crop which will grow in almost any soil.        It is widely planted to protect and improve the land, for        use as pasture and for its grain . . . which is a staple        food in northern Europe. Second only to wheat in        nutritional value, rye has a fair gluten content. Ground        into flour, it makes a delicious (if somewhat heavy)        bread and is often used in combination with other flours        for a lighter result. Rye is also available whole, flaked        or ground into grits (for use as a cereal) and can be        found in most health food stores.      </p>      <h3>        SWEDISH RYE BREAD      </h3>      <p>        From the <em>New Age Vegetarian Cookbook.</em>      </p>      <p>        Soften:      </p>      <p>        1 cake yeast in 1/4 cup lukewarm water      </p>      <p>        Add:<br />        1/2 tablespoon brown sugar<br />        <br />        Boil and let cool:<br />        1 cup milk<br />        1 cup water      </p>      <p>        Add to milk and water and beat well: 3 cups unbleached        flour      </p>      <p>        Let rise until double in bulk.      </p>      <p>        Mix in saucepan and boil for 1 minute:<br />        1/4 cup unsulfured molasses<br />        1/2 cup dark corn syrup<br />        1 teaspoon fennel seed      </p>      <p>        Strain, cool and add: 1/2 cup shortening      </p>      <p>        When cooled to lukewarm, add to dough mixture along        with:<br />        4 cups rye flour, sifted with<br />        1/2 tablespoon salt, and add<br />        grated rind of 2 oranges      </p>      <p>        Let rise until doubled in bulk, knead and shape into        long, thin loaves. Put into greased pans and let rise        until doubled. Bake at 400° F for 15 minutes, lower        heat to 350° F and continue baking for another 45-60        minutes.      </p>      <h3>        RYE BERRY CASSEROLE      </h3>      <p>        From <em>The Deaf Smith Country Cookbook.</em> You will        need 2 cups rye berries (whole kernels), 2 medium onions,        a small purple cabbage (about 1 pound), water, salt and        sesame oil. Rinse and drain the rye berries and place in        a pressure cooker with 3 cups water and 1/2 teaspoon        salt. Bring to full pressure, lower heat and cook 45        minutes. Allow to cool until pressure is reduced to zero,        uncover and stir. Put 1 tablespoon of oil into heated        skillet, add chopped onions and sauté until        tender. Cut cabbage into 1" pieces, add to skillet and        sauté 5 minutes. Cover and simmer until done,        adding water if necessary to prevent scorching. Mix        vegetables with rye berries, add salt to taste and place        in oiled 2-quart casserole. Bake at 350° F for 15        minutes. Serves six.      </p>          <p>        Oats occur in many forms in the wild state and several        cultivated varieties have been developed. They were        probably brought to America by the Scots. Among the        grains, oats now rank third in economic importance (after        wheat and corn) and the United States is the major        producer, followed by Canada and the Soviet Union. A good        source of protein and B vitamins, oats are an important        livestock feed. For human consumption, the husks are        removed and the grain is rolled into thin, flaky sections        or ground into oatmeal. The whole grain minus husks is        known as groats. Steelcut oats have been reduced to        smaller particles and grits are finer yet.      </p>      <p>        OATMEAL COOKIES      </p>      <p>        From the <em>Whole Earth Cookbook.</em> Beat together        until creamy:<br />        2 eggs<br />        3/4 cup shortening<br />        2/3 cup honey<br />        2 teaspoons vanilla      </p>      <p>        Add:<br />        1 cup whole wheat flour<br />        3 cups oatmeal<br />        2 teaspoons baling powder<br />        1/2 teaspoon salt      </p>      <p>        Mix well. Add and stir in:<br />        1/2 cup chopped nuts<br />        1/2 cup shredded, unsweetened coconut      </p>      <p>        Drop by rounded teaspoons on greased cookie sheet and        bake for 10 minutes at 325° F.      </p>      <p>        THE BEST BREAD RECIPE IN THE WORLD by Susan Sikse      </p>      <p>        For two loaves:      </p>      <p>        Pour two cups boiling water over one cup dry rolled oats;        let this stand for about half an tour (until the oats        have thoroughly softened). Then: soak two packages of        yeast in 1/3 cup lukewarm water. Add one table spoon        salt, 1/2 cup honey, and two tablespoons melted butter to        the oats, then add the yeast. Gradually add enough flour        so that the dough is kneadable (between four and five        cups . . . flour does not have to be sifted). Knead five        to ten minutes, or until the dough is elastic and smooth,        and add flour as necessary. If you knead the dough in the        bowl you mixed it up in, the kitchen won't get quite so        floury, and you can oil the surface of the dough and        leave in the same bowl (covered with a towel and in a        warm place) to let it rise. When the dough has doubled in        bulk, punch it down, divide in two, shape into two        loaves, and put each in an 8" X 4" bread pan. Turn the        oven on to 325° F . . . it will be warm by the time        the loaves are nearly doubled in bulk. Mix a few drops of        water into an egg yolk and use this mixture to coat the        tops of the loaves. Sprinkle lots of poppy seed on the        loaves and bake for about 50 minutes.      </p>           <p>        Corn, native to the Americas, is a staple food of Mexico        and some of the South American countries. There are        several varieties including dent corn (harvested when        dry, used for livestock feed and ground into meal, flour,        grits, etc.), sweet corn (picked and eaten when the        kernels are mature but tender) and popcorn. Many strains        have been developed for cultivation in different        localities and hybridizing of these specialized strains        has resulted in increased yields (but less per-bushel        nutritional value). Corn is high in trace minerals and B        vitamins, and yellow corn has a greater vitamin A content        than the white varieties. This is the most practical of        the grains for growing and harvesting on a small scale.      </p>      <p>        The next two recipes come from the <em>New Age Vegetarian        Cookbook.</em>      </p>      <p>        PLAIN ROASTED CORN      </p>      <p>        Put fresh corn on the cob (still in the husks) in        350° F oven and roast until tender or about 1/2 hour.        Remove the husks and silks and serve piping hot with        melted butter and seasonings.      </p>      <p>        SOUTHERN SPOONBREAD      </p>      <p>        Mix 2 cups of yellow cornmeal (sifted 3 times) into 2        cups boiling water and stir until smooth. Add 3        tablespoons of melted butter and 1 teaspoon of salt. Stir        in 1-1/2 cups milk. Separate 3 eggs and beat the yolks        until light and the whites until stiff. Add yolks to the        cornmeal mixture and stir, then fold in beaten whites.        Pour into a buttered dish and bake for about 30 minutes        at 350° F. Serve hot in the same dish. Eight        servings.      </p>      <p>        CORN BREAD      </p>      <p>        The following corn bread recipe is from <em>The Deaf        Smith Country Cookbook.</em> Mix together 3 cups        stoneground cornmeal, I teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons        of corn oil. Pour 2 cups boiling water into the mixture        well . Add ore cup milk and let cool for about 40        minutes. Stir in 1 beaten egg and 3 teaspoons baking        powder. Pour the batter into a hot, well-oiled 8" X 8"        pan or muffin tins. Bake at 425° F for 30-40 minutes        and serve hot.      </p>           <p>        Rice has been cultivated for centuries and probably        originated in southeastern Asia. It is now grown        extensively in China and India (where it serves as a        major portion of the human diet) and is also produced        commercially in Australia and the Americas. (Wild rice is        native to North America.) The cultivation of rice        requires long periods of sunshine and a heavy soil that        will hold water, and is usually done in "paddies" which        are flooded throughout the growing season.      </p>      <p>        The outer layer of this grain contains most of the        important nutrients. Therefore, natural brown rice is far        more nutritious than white (which has had the bran or        polish removed) . . . and wild rice is considered twice        again as vitamin-packed as the domesticated variety.        "Converted" rice is said to have had the vitamins forced        into the white, starchy part of the kernel before        milling, thereby saving them from being lost in the        chaff.      </p>      <p>        <em>The New York Times Natural Foods Cookbook</em>        recommends the following recipes using brown rice.<br />        <br />        RICE PUDDING      </p>      <p>        Place in a buttered 1-1/2-quart baking dish:<br />        2 cups brown rice, cooked<br />        1/2 cup raisins<br />        1/2 teaspoon grated lemon rind<br />        1 teaspoon lemon juice      </p>      <p>        Beat together and pour over rice mixture:<br />        1/2 cup honey<br />        1/2 teaspoon vanilla flavoring<br />        3 eggs 2-1/2 cups milk<br />        1/4 teaspoon salt      </p>      <p>        Stir mix and bake at 325° F for 30 minutes or until        set. Serves four.      </p>      <p>        BOILED BROWN RICE      </p>      <p>        Place 1 cup brown rice (rinsed and drained), 2 to 3 cups        water and salt to taste in a saucepan. Bring to boil,        lower heat, cover tightly and simmer slowly until the        rice is tender and the water has been absorbed (about 45        minutes). Do not stir during cooking. (Using the greater        amount of water results in softer rice.) Yields about 4        cups.      </p>      <p>        BREAKFAST RICE      </p>      <p>        Put 1 cup brown rice in electric blender and grind until        kernels are reduced to 1/2 their original size. Combine        with 1 cup raisins and 4 cups milk in a saucepan. Bring        the mixture to a boil, cover tightly and simmer over low        heat 10-15 minutes or until tender. Serve with maple        syrup. Makes four servings.      </p>      <p>        The books from which these recipes are taken are        available from MOTHER'S<br />        Bookshelf, P.O.
