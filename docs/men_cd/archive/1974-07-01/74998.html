                    <p>      Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there      were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming introductory      handbooks available, many of us welcomed the publication of      Richard Langer's Grow !t! with open arms. Now that we're      all older and more experienced, however, some folks find it      increasingly easy to criticize that breakthrough beginner's      guide (see the Feedback sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and      25).<br />      Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just      as important (probably more so) now as Grow It! was two      years ago and which may well come up for its share of      criticism in another 24 months or so.<br />      Be that as it may, John and Sally Seymour's record of 18      successful years on a shirttail-sized homestead. in England      is important now and should offer welcome encouragement to      today's back -to-the-landers both real and imaginary. I      started serializing the book in my No. 25 issue and I'm      sure that many readers will want a personal copy for their      home libraries. <strong>-MOTHER.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>DAIRY</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>if the butter do taste a little of the Swedish turnip,      it<br />      will do very well where there is plenty of that sweet<br />      sauce which early rising and bodily labour are ever      sure<br />      to bring.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>William<br />      Cobbet</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILK</strong><br />      Milk is one of the most complex organic substances that one      could possibly imagine, and the extraordinary things that      it will do, and that can be done with it, are legion. Long      before the word 'plastics' was invented people were making      knitting needles and spectacle frames out of it.    </p>    <p>      If you leave fresh milk alone in the summer time it      curdles. This is because the lactic acid bacteria      (Streptococcus lacticus) feed upon the lactose which is one      of the constituents of milk (its sugar in fact) and change      the lactose sugar into lactic acid. As the milk becomes      more acid the isoelectric point is reached and at this      point the particles of the milk no longer repel each other,      but come together into what we call curd. Milk curdles best      in warm weather or in warm climates (at about 77° F or      25° C). We consume a great deal of naturally curdled      milk: it is acid in taste, but mildly acid and very good      and digestible. In South Africa it is called dik melk and      is a major article of diet. The South Africans have a      refinement of dik melk which they call calabash. It is made      in this way: milk is put inside a hollowed-out calabash and      allowed to curdle. Every day some of the curdled milk is      taken out of the calabash and some more fresh milk put in.      Before it is taken out the calabash is shaken like a      cocktail shaker. As the weeks go by the taste of the stuff      that comes out of the calabash gets stronger and stronger      until it is simply delicious. You must never 'starve' it,      or it will turn bad: every day some must be taken out and      some put in. I have drunk from a calabash which had been      kept going thus for six years, and I kept one going myself      for a year. I know somebody who does it in Wales, but in a      bottle.    </p>    <p>      You can cause milk to clot immediately, that is form curds,      by adding rennet. Rennet is stuff that is taken from a      calf's fourth stomach (see Chapter 9). Presumably you could      obtain it yourself if you killed a young calf, but we buy      it in splendid little stoneware bottles from R.J. Fullwood      and Bland, 25 Bevenden Street, London N.I.    </p>    <p>      Milk contains all the vitamins known to man, and no less      than sixty fatty acids have so far been identified in milk,      which gives an inkling of its enormous complexity. Let it      be thought that drinking or eating all these fatty acids      will lead to coronary thrombosis, let us remember the      Borana of northern Kenya and southern Ethiopia, and the      Turkana their sworn enemies, who live on nothing else but      milk except for an occasional gorge on meat when they      ritually slaughter an animal. No Borana has ever been known      to have coronary thrombosis. I knew these people very well      and they were very healthy. The only element that milk is      short of, from a dietetic point of view, is iron.    </p>    <p>      If you keep milk at a higher temperature than 77° F      (25° C), say at 95° F (35° C), and inoculate it      with the right bacteria (Bacillus bulgaricusJ, you will get      not dik melk but yoghourt. Bulgaricus likes more warmth      than S. lacticus and can tolerate much higher acidity. The      way to make yoghourt is to boil your milk (to kill rival      bacteria), cool it to 95° F (35° C), inoculate it      with live yoghourt, and keep it at that temperature. It      will keep quite well owing to its acidity.    </p>    <p>      Pasteurizing is done to all commercial milk nowadays: it      kills T.B. and brucellosis bacteria and makes the milk keep      a long time. It can only be done with special equipment,      and the self-supporter will never wish to do it: his cows      haven't got brucellosis or T.B. and he doesn't want his      milk to keep for long periods. In any case, pasteurized      milk is only fit for towns people, who have got to the      state when they don't know anything better.    </p>    <p>      To pasteurize milk by the Holder Method keep it at from      145° F (62° C) to 150° F (65° C) for 30      minutes.<br />      To pasteurize by the Flash Method heat to 158° F      (70° C) quickly and cool immediately.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CREAM</strong><br />      If you want cream you can get it by 'setting' the milk, as      soon as it comes from the cow, preferably in the cool,      whereupon the cream floats to the surface. You can get it      off with a 'fleeter' or skimmer (a little metal dish with      holes in it), or by setting it in a wide slate trough with      a hole in the bottom, the hole bunged up with a stick. When      the cream has risen pull the stick out; the skimmed milk      will run through the hole and leave the cream sticking to      the bottom of the trough. You can also put the milk, fresh,      through a separator. This is a centrifuge, and separates      the cream from the milk by whirling both round and round      whereupon the heavier milk is flung outwards and the      lighter cream is forced inwards. We have a separator. It is      very good, but as it takes some time to clean and      reassemble we only use it if we have a lot of milk to deal      with. It is more efficient than 'setting'. Set cream has 20      percent butter fat; separated cream has 35 percent. The      milk left over after separating is naturally very thin      (practically no butter fat at all) but is still rich in      vitamins and minerals, and marvellous for all young animals      and for pigs. To make Devonshire cream, set your fresh milk      for 12 hours, scald to 187° F (92° C), cool for 24      hours and then skim.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUTTER</strong><br />      Butter is made by bashing cream about after it has      'ripened', which means after the lactic acid bacteria have      got to work long enough to turn some of the lactose, or      milk sugar, into lactic acid. Commercially the cream is      pasteurized and then inoculated with a pure culture of      lactic acid bacteria. This is why shop butter is so      reliably uniform, and so reliably dull. We make butter by      keeping the cream for at least 24 hours (twice a day we add      some more to it-but the last lot to be put in must be left      in for at least twelve hours before churning) and then      churning. Nowadays we have a small glass churn with an      electrically driven paddle which revolves in it. It takes      about five minutes at the longest-often not more than one      minute. In theory the cream should be ripened at 68° F      (20° C), but we can't be so theoretical.    </p>    <p>      Before we had the electric paddle we used a variety of      churns. If you have plenty of cream, say the cream from      three cows, you can usefully use one of those beautiful      varnished wooden butter churns, that turn end-over-end. A      wooden cylinder open at the top, with a plunger in it that      was worked up and down, was one way of doing it. A 'blow'      churn, which is a glass jar with a hand-operated paddle      turning in it, is very good if you can get one. Anything'      that gives the cream a good bashing will do. The whole      secret is to get the cream properly ripened first. If you      have trouble try keeping it at a higher temperature, and      try adding some existing sour milk or cream as a 'starter'.      If all else fails send off for a pure culture of lactic      acid bacteria, but I never met anybody who had to do that.      If the butter won't 'come', don't go on churning hopelessly      for hours. Put it in the warm, if it is too cold, and wait      a few hours, and try again. Don't get it too warm though:      68° F (20° C) is about right.    </p>    <p>      When the butter 'comes' a dramatic thing happens. Suddenly      your cream separates into butter milk, and a mass of little      yellow pellets as big as Number Six shot. If it is too hot      the pellets will be larger, and soft: if too cold they will      be smaller. Drain the butter milk out, and put it to one      side. It is almost noble drink, and if I had enough butter      milk to drink I don't think I would often drink anything      else.    </p>    <p>      Now put plenty of cold water in your butter, churn again      and drain. The whole purpose now is to wash the butter, to      get every drop of milk out of it. The cream you made the      butter from was quite sour. The butter milk is beautifully      sour. But the butter must not be the least bit sour.      Therefore, if you want your butter to keep well and not go      rancid, wash and wash again. Wash until the water comes out      quite clear. Squodge the butter up in the cold water as      much as you like. Squeeze the water out of it again. Dump      the butter out on to a clean board-wash and squeeze-wash      and squeeze. The old fashioned wooden butter-maker was a      wonderful tool-I wish I had one.    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle salt on, according to taste, squodge the butter      about hard, taste a bit. If it's too salt wash some salt      out with fresh water and taste again. If it's not salt      enough add some more salt and squodge again. Obviously you      must squodge until the salt is evenly mixed right through      the butter. If 2.5 percent of the whole butter consists of      salt (in other words if it is pretty salty butter) the      butter will keep for a long time. Unsalty butter won't keep      for so long unless you keep it in the deep freeze. Always      wrap butter-light and air oxydize the unsaturated fatty      acids called oleic and linoleic and cause rancidity.      Rancidity is caused in wrapped butter by the decomposition      of butyrin into butyric acid.    </p>    <p>      If you heat butter you drive off the volatile fats which      cause rancidity, and your butter then does not go rancid.      Nor does it taste any more like butter, because you have      lost the very elements that make it so taste. But the      Indians turn this into account by making ghee (samli in      East Africa). If you want to preserve butter in a glut, and      have no deep freeze, you can do the same. Put the butter in      a pot over the fire and let it simmer for an hour. Skim the      scum off. Pour it into a sterilized container, cover from      the air, and it will keep many months. It won't taste like      butter but it will be very good to cook with: part of the      glorious flavour of Indian food comes from the ghee in      which it is cooked.    </p>    <p>      But in our cooler climate you can store well-salted butter      in barrels right into the winter. The barrel (or      earthenware tub) should be scalded, dried in the wind, and      the butter should be flung hard into it to exclude all air,      each layer sprinkled with salt and banged down with the      closed fist. All air must be driven out. If the butter is      too salt when you want to use it you can always wash the      salt out again.    </p>    <p>      A word here about the cleaning of all dairy implements. If      you want all your dairy produce to keep well, and not taste      tainted, scrupulous cleanliness is necessary in the dairy.      From the hands that milk the cow, through the milking pail,      'setting' pans or separator, butter churn, 'Scots hands',      butter worker or draining board on which the butter is      washed, cheese making bowls, chessits, followers, cloths:      everything must be clean. All utensils must be cleaned of      any matter sticking to them, then scalded thoroughly in      boiling water, washed well in cold clean water (and it must      be clean), put upside down to rinse and, if a wooden      implement, put out in the clean wind to dry. Never use a      'tea-towel' or dish cloth to dry dairy utensils. Such rags      are laden with germs. If your milk starts going sour too      soon you are not sterilizing something properly. Remember      the sequence: scour thoroughly (you don't have to use any      beastly detergent, which will make your septic tank foam      and stink), scald with boiling water, rinse immediately in      clean cold water, turn upside down to drain-in the wind if      possible. Store upside down so dust doesn't settle inside.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CHEESE</strong><br />      Cream cheese is terribly easy to make, but as it won't keep      long there is no great advantage in making it, except in so      far as it can be very pleasant to eat. When milk goes thick      on you( as it often will) simply pour the curds and they      into a muslin and hang it up to drip. The whey will run out      , for the pigs. the curd will turn into cream cheese. you      can flavour it with salt and herbs and all sorts of things.      I've heard of wrapping it in hazel leaves, then cloth , and      burying in the garden for three days.    </p>    <p>      But it is the making of hard cheese that is important to      the self supporter, or the self-supporting community, for      here we have a way of storing the summer flush of milk      (which we can take as being free because it is all made      from grass) for the winter, when milk is scarce and      expensive. For a non-vegan vegetarian community I would say      that the manufacture of cheese was absolutely essential,      but for any homesteader it is an enormous asset. A pound of      cheese has 2,000 calories of energy in it. Meat from the      fore-quarters of an ox has 1,100 calories. No wonder the      navigators who dug the canals all over England, and later      built the railways, made cheese the greater part of their      diet. Good cheese from unpasteurized milk and honest      wholemeal bread gave them the strength to move mountains.    </p>    <p>      To make cheese you will need some equipment. You will need      a cheese press (unless you make Stilton, which is      unpressed), a chessit and a follower. The chessit is a      cylindrical barrel open at the top and with holes in it to      let out the whey. The follower is a piston which goes down      in it and presses the cheese: just a round wooden board, in      fact. The press is an arrangement of levers, heavy weights      and gears capable of putting, in some cases, up to two tons      of pressure on the cheese, by means of the follower inside      the chessit. You can still buy old cheese presses in the      countryside, but as more and more 'selfsupporters' come      about they are getting very scarce. It should not be beyond      the wit of man to make one. A car jack is capable of      exerting enough pressure but it would be hard to measure      this pressure. Maybe O.M.C.S. (Old Mother Common Sense)      would have to be brought into play again. You can get      cheese presses from Messrs. Clares (Wells) Ltd., Somerset.    </p>    <p>      The making of good, and consistently good, hard cheese is a      very difficult and extremely complicated operation. Many an      old farmer's wife, in the days before acidimeters and pure      cultures of this and that, and all the rest of the      scientific stuff were invented, turned out fine cheese year      after year: probably much better than most of the cheese      that is made today under the most scientific conditions.      But one must remember that the farmer's wife in question      had inherited her dairy from her mother or mother-in-law,      had been taught to make the local cheese as a child, and      had developed what was almost an instinct to tell her just      when to do each separate operation with the same precision      as the modern cheese maker with his thermometers and      acidimeters. That craft and that skill have now died out:      killed by the onslaught of shiploads of factory made cheese      from over the seas, and two world wars which made real farm      cheese making illegal, like spying for the enemy, and which      killed by stupid legislation so many of our inherited      country skills and crafts. Sally and I sailed a boat to      Holland once, and tied up on a canal at a remote farm, and      there found the farmer, his wife, and no less than sixteen      children. The cowshed was attached to the dwelling house      (an excellent arrangement) and the farmer milked sixteen      cows. I asked him, in my foolishness, if he had a milking      machine. He pointed to his children and said: 'What do I      want with a milking machine?' He turned all his surplus      milk into cheese: huge cart-wheel cheeses, some of which      were nieuw kaas or new cheese, and eaten after two months,      and others oud kaas, which was soaked in brine and then      kept in the great cheese cellar for a year. We tried both,      and they were both delicious beyond any telling of it. We      bought a whole nieuw kaas and it kept us in marvellous      cheese for six months, and the last slice was as delicious      as the first. This cheese was made completely      traditionally, with no scientific instruments at all, and      Meneer van de Poel told me they never had a bad cheese.    </p>    <p>      The Dutch cheese (Gouda and Edam) that is sent to England      is specially made for the English market out of pasteurized      separated milk in big factories. The Dutch themselves will      not eat factory-made cheese. Much Dutch cheese is sent to      France, and the French will not buy factory-made cheese.      Only farm cheese is sold to the domestic market in Holland      and to France. Only the English will take the factory-made      stuff.    </p>    <p>      Let us get back to our self-supporter's cheese: the      selfsupporter is not starting with an inherited lore of      cheese making, and therefore he must use every aid      available to him. The main aids are a thermometer and an      acidimeters. Sally has been making cheese for the last      fifteen years without the use of the latter, and I will      describe the way she does it with, perhaps, a few      flourishes of my own. I am not going to pretend that every      Sally cheese from the year dot has been a prizewinner      because that is not the case. I know a woman who makes      cheese by more or less this method (without an acidimeter)      and for many years she made the most splendid cheese in the      world. You could not have found better cheese had you      searched the Earth to the Antipodes, and it was a standing      invitation to gluttony. But suddenly her cheese lost its      fine quality, although she did not alter her methods in the      least degree. Why? A change of bug? No one knows. I think      that she should now turn to the acidimeter, and perhaps      also starter too, and then perhaps she would discover the      reason for her falling-off.    </p>    <p>      But this is more or less the way in which Sally makes      cheese. Because she generally only milks one cow, and in      the summer there is a big demand with us for fresh milk,      she generally has to save up several days' milk to get      enough for a cheese. Well that in itself is wrong. What      should happen is that you keep the evening's milk, and in      the morning you dump the morning's milk into it. Then you      make your cheese. This sounds trivial, but in fact it is      very important. But before you dump the morning's milk in      with the evening's milk you have to go through a little      rigmarole with the cream of the evening's milk, for if you      don't the cream won't mix back again with the milk (it has      all come to the surface in the night of course) and you      will lose the cream in the whey which you give to the pigs      and have 'thin' cheese. What you do is to fleet the cream      off the evening's milk (skim it), raise its temperature to      85° F (30° C), and dump it back in the milk again.      Then stir it well in. Then dump in the morning's milk.    </p>    <p>      If you have starter put it in now. I will discuss starter,      and how to use it, later on. Sally has never used it, but      that does not mean to say that it would not be better if      she did.<br />      Raise the temperature of the milk to 90° F (32° C).    </p>    <p>      Put 1 teaspoonful of rennet in a cupful of cold water and      put it in. (Rennet from R.J. Fullwood and Bland, 25      Bevenden Street, London N.I.)    </p>    <p>      Stir for about five minutes with your hand. As soon as the      milk begins to cling to your fingers when you pull them out      stop stirring. Another test is to drop a drop of water in      the milk. If the water just disappears go on stirring. If      it stays on top in a globule then stop. This again sounds      trivial, but it is very important to get it right. The      thing is, if you don't stir you will lose the cream from      your milk and your cheese will be thin. Now as soon as you      can no longer go on stirring begin to stroke the top of the      milk with the fleeter (the fleeter is a slightly curved      metal disc with a handle with holes in it, used for      fleeting, or skimming, cream off milk) in order to 'send      the cream down'. Do this for a few minutes.    </p>    <p>      When the curd no longer sticks to your hand, but feels firm      when you press it, i.e., in about fifty minutes from when      you stopped stirring, cut the curd. You will have by then      curds and whey. Cut the curds (which don't take much      cutting), either with a knife or, if you have them, with a      pair of American curd knives. The latter are multi-bladed      knives, one with vertical blades and one with horizontal.      Your aim is to cut the curd into cubes about 3/4 inch      square. So with curd knives you will obviously make one      pass with the horizontal blades and two, at right angles to      each other, with the vertical. No more. If you just have to      use an ordinary knife cut diagonally from one side of the      receptacle, then diagonally from the other two sides,      trying to achieve cubes 3/4 inch square. You don't have to      measure them of course-it's not that critical.    </p>    <p>      Warm the curds and whey very slowly-not quicker than a rise      of one degree in three minutes-to 100° F (38° C).      While this warming is going on stir the curds and whey very      gently with the hand. If you stir too hard you will lose      cream which is the one thing you want to avoid. This      particular heating is called the scalding. It is not done      for every cheese, Stilton for example. If you have a      water-jacketed cheese vat this raising of the temperature      of course is easy: if you have not the best way to do it is      to scoop a saucepanful of whey out, put it on the stove,      heat it, and put it back again, Go on repeating this until      you have got the whole to 100° F.    </p>    <p>      The next operation, which is a non-operation, is called      pitching. All you do is leave the stuff alone. The curd      just soaks in its whey, and you don't stir it or anything,      but what you do do is keep testing for acidity. For the      idea of the pitching is to give the lactic acid bacteria      time to work and attain a certain degree of acidity, and it      is most important that this acidity should be just right.      If you do not use an acidimeter the Way to test for acidity      is to take a piece of curd, touch it on a hot iron (the hot      stove-top will do) and draw it away. If the acidity is just      right threads of just half an inch long will come off from      the curd before they break. If they are shorter than this      leave to pitch longer. If they are longer than half an inch      you are going to have a dry acid cheese and there's nothing      you can do about it. So when the threads are just half an      inch-drain off the whey. Into the pig bucket with it. It      has done its work of raising the acidity of the curd.    </p>    <p>      Now comes cheddaring. This is the process of wrapping the      curd into bundles about nine inches across in cheese cloth      and leaving them on a sloping surface so that the whey can      gently drain out of them. Turn the bundles from time to      time. Then milling. If you haven't got a curd-mill (and why      should you have?) get some of those guitar-playing friends      of yours, see that they wash their hands carefully, and      exhort them to break the curd up into pieces as big as      walnuts. And salting. Chuck an ounce of salt in to every 4      Ibs. of curd and mix well through.    </p>    <p>      Now take your chessit, which is a cylinder of wood or      metal, line it with a cheese cloth, and load your      walnut-size pieces into it. Wrap the cloth over the top of      it all and put it in your cheese press. Apply about a      couple of stone of pressure. In other words very light.    </p>    <p>      After say six hours pull the cheese out, take the cloth off      it and wring it out in warm water, wrap the cheese up in it      again, turn the cheese, and return it to the chessit. Apply      half a cwt. pressure.    </p>    <p>      Leave it thus for two days, turning it once. Then give it      half a ton pressure for a couple of days, turning it once.      Take it out, paste on clean bandages with flour and water,      put it on a clean shelf (very important) in a      well-ventilated store with a temperature of about 55°      to 60° F (13° to 16° C), turn it every day for      a week, then turn about twice a week; always brush mould      off it and suffer not cheese mites to exist. Contrary to      general belief they are not a good thing. Some people dip      the whole thing in wax after a week or two's drying and I      think this is a very good idea.    </p>    <p>      If you try the above method and find it not satisfactory      just try the following process. Omit the scalding. Instead      take the 3/4-inch cubes of curd out of the whey as soon as      you have cut them, and go straight in to your cheddaring      process, tightening the cloth from time to time. After      twenty minutes start doing the hot iron test. When you get      your half-inch threads, mill.    </p>    <p>      If this still does not please you try scalding as before,      but to a higher temperature, say to 107° F (42° C).      There are two things to remark on: [1) don't try to make      cheese in the winter: it's economically crazy anyway and      furthermore much more difficult; [2] the bigger cheeses you      can make the better. You should get about 1-1/4 Ibs. of      fresh cheese from a gallon of milk, and about 1 Ib. when it      is fully ripened. If you can get, say, ten gallons together      with your morning and evening milking, and can cope with      this quantity, you will have a decent-sized cheese.      Personally I would not go to the trouble of making cheese      from the milk of just one cow, but in this Sally would      disagree with me.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STARTER</strong><br />      The purpose of adding starter is to ensure a rapid      development of the sort of bacteria you want-lactic acid      bacteria. The way to do this, obviously, is to put in a lot      of lively lactic acid bacteria, and that is your starter.      Many cheesemakers do not use starter, but you may find you      have to. You can buy pure cultures of lactic acid bacteria      (from Messrs. Harsens Lab., Reading, or The Somerset Farm      Institute, Kennington, Bridgwater, Somerset, amongst other      places) but you can also make your own starter. You can      only do it in the summertime.    </p>    <p>      Take a quart of clean milk from a healthy cow. Do not      include the first few squeezes of the cow's tits-these are      heavily infected with bacteria: in any case they should      always be given to the cow-shed cat. Milk with clean hands      into a sterilized bucket (boiling water-then cold      water-then upside down). Strain the milk through a sterile      pad of cotton wool into a sterilized bowl.    </p>    <p>      Place the bowl in your dairy. Keep the windows open. Now 1      am assuming that your dairy is clean, for this is      essential. The air of a dairy is teeming with lactic acid      bacteria, which are the chaps you want. Keep the quart of      milk as near as you can between 70° to 75° F (21 to      24° C). The quart of milk will curdle.    </p>    <p>      Now we are only halfway there. Take some milk (fresh milk      that has been through the separator is best because it is      better without the butter fat: but the milk must be      fresh-not long from the cow). Pasteurize it by scalding it      to 185° F (85° C) and keeping it there for 10      minutes and then cooling it quickly (by standing the      saucepan in cool running water) to 70° to 750 F (210 to      24- C).    </p>    <p>      Skim the top off your quart of curdled milk and give the      skimming to the cat (or eat it yourself). Then dump the      rest of the curdled milk into the pasteurized milk. What      you are doing now, you see, is heavily inoculating sterile      milk with lactic acid bacteria. Cover with a muslin cloth      and keep between 70° to 75° F (21° to 24°      C). Keep thus for 24 hours. Skim the surface off and what      is left is your starter, and can be added to the milk from      which you are going to make your cheese.    </p>    <p>      You can keep this starter going, by, every day or so,      adding some of it to more pasteurized milk. The use of      starter takes some risk out of cheesemaking but remember      the best cheese in the world is made without it.    </p>    <p>      Is this trouble worthwhile? Well, if you are making a lot      of cheese for 'export' (I mean to sell off the holding), or      if you are the cheesemaking brother or sister in i      fair-sized community then I would say it is. You will get      more consistently good cheese. And really it takes longer      to read this than it does to do it. Once you have done all      these cheesemaking operations half a dozen times, so you      don't have to look at the book, you can really do them      quite quickly and easily.    </p>    <p>      Assuming that you have to make a large quantity of cheese      and wish to do it at least semi-professionally, and have      riot inherited a dairy, complete with all the right      bacteria with a pedigree of a million generations on the      same soil, and ten human generations of skill from your      maternal grandmother, I will describe the way in which      Cheddar cheese is made on the few farms which still make      it. I have chosen Cheddar because it is a straight-forward      cheese which will keep. A full-sized Cheddar should weigh      near on 100 pounds, should not be cut into for six months      at least, is better after nine months, and if properly made      and carefully kept it will be good the second winter after      it is made. Do not be put off by the word 'Cheddar'      remembering all the dull 'Cheddar' mouse-trap you have      bought at the shops. Factory-made cheese, from pasteurized      milk, can never be anything else but fuel for the masses.    </p>    <p>      In the first place you will need a means of testing the      acidity of your milk and whey and curd. In the second place      you will need a cheese vat. The vat should be an oblong      box, lined ideally with stainless steel but wood will do      (if it doesn't leak). The advantage of metal though is that      it can be either heated or cooled by hot or cold water or      steam passed round it in a jacket. Professional      cheesemakers will want one of these because they represent      an enormous saving of time and labour. Old-fashioned cheese      ladies just used a wooden tub. It is an advantage if the      vat can be lifted up at one end so that the whey can drain      downhill away from the curd. There should be a tap at the      bottom at one end. If you don't get a water jacketed vat      make do with a plain rectangular bin-of wood or metal-and      raise your temperature when need be by the laborious      process of dipping out whey, heating it on the stove,      putting it back again, taking out some more from the other      end, etc. Professional vats can be got from Messrs. Clares      (Wells) Ltd., Wells, Somerset.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACID</strong><br />      Milk cannot be made into cheese until the acidity of the      milk has been raised by the action of bacteria. There are a      number of bacteria which can do this, but the most      beneficial from the cheesemaker's point of view is Bacillus      acidi lactici. These little creatures convert one molecule      of lactose into four molecules of lactic acid thus:    </p>    <p>      C 12 H 12 O 11    </p>    <p>      4 C 3 H 6 O 3    </p>    <p>      + bacteria    </p>    <p>      + H 2 O + bacteria =    </p>    <p>      Lactose    </p>    <p>      lactic acid    </p>    <p>      These bacteria eventually kill themselves with their own      pollution. Like humans on this planet they eventually reach      such numbers that their 'planet' (the milk tub) is not big      enough to support them and, by their excessive numbers,      they pollute their environment (by turning it too acid) to      such an extent that they die, and other bacteria, which can      withstand and exploit this situation, take over. These      latter are putrefactive bacteria and they turn milk bad.      There is all the difference in the world between sour milk      (which is delicious and highly beneficial) and bad milk,      which is not beneficial at all.    </p>    <p>      The mystique of cheesemaking consists entirely of doing all      the operations at exactly the right degree of acidity. The      kind of cheese you make, and the quality of that cheese,      depends entirely upon this factor of the correct acidity.      The correct acidities of the material at the various stages      in the making of Cheddar, in the summer time, are as      follows:    </p>     <p>      The manner in which you test this acidity is much simpler      than it sounds. Take 10 cc of the milk or whey. Add to it      three or four drops of phenol phthalein solution. Put a      measured amount of N/9 solution of caustic soda in a      burette. That is, fill the burette up to the level      indicated on it. Drip the caustic soda solution drop by      drop into the whey or milk, stirring and watching      carefully. As soon as the whey or milk gets a pink tinge,      stop. Read off how much caustic soda solution you have      used. As you use a burette which is specially measured off      for you you can read the acidity of the sample straight off      on the burette. To do this takes much less time than to      read about it. You can buy a Dairy Acidimeter from: Astell      Lab. Service, 172 Brownhill Road, Catford, London S.E.6. It      consists of the burette on a stand, a bowl, a bottle of      phenol phthalein, a bottle of N/9 (or Standard) caustic      soda, a pipette for measuring the milk or whey, and glass      stirring rods. You do not have to be a Ph.D. in chemistry      to use it; any good cook-general could learn to do it in      five minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FARMHOUSE CHEDDAR</strong><br />      Cool your evening's milk (if the weather is hot) and leave      overnight. Skim the cream off in the morning-heat that      cream on the stove-pour it back again. You do this to mix      the cream back with the milk. Dump in your morning's milk.    </p>    <p>      Add 1/2 gallon starter (optional) to 100 gallons milk.      Stir.    </p>    <p>      Test for acidity. When 0.19 add 4 fluid oz. rennet per 100      gallons. The milk should be 84° F (30° C) when you      do this.    </p>    <p>      Deep-stir for 4 to 5 minutes. Then top-stir only. You know      when to stop deep-stirring when the milk clings to your      hands.    </p>    <p>      About ten minutes after the rennet has gone in coagulation      occurs.    </p>    <p>      The acidity goes down as it coagulates. When it is exactly      0.14 cut the curd. You will have to have American curd      knives to do this effectively.    </p>    <p>      Stir by hand-very carefully and gently. Don't bash the curd      about or bruise it or you will lose cream.<br />      Slowly (1 degree F every three minutes-not quicker) raise      the temperature to 90° F (32° C). Heat a little      quicker (1 degree F every two minutes) to 100° F      (38° C). Stop heating.    </p>    <p>      Stir by hand until a handful of the curd feels firm and      springy. Keep stirring until acidity is 0.18. Then pitch,      i.e., leave the curd to soak in its whey. Keep testing for      acidity. When whey squeezed from a handful of curd is 0.21      acid drain off the whey.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHEDDARING</strong><br />      This is the process of wrapping the drained blocks of curd      into cloths and leaving them on the dry bottom of the      sloping vat so that the whey keeps dribbling out of them,      turning them occasionally until the acidity has reached      0.75 to as much as 0.95. If you have not got your      acidimeter here you can test by the hot iron test (on the      stove top). You should be able to draw threads off your hot      iron in your whey at least 1-1 /2 inches long.    </p>    <p>      Then mill. You can buy a cheese mill or you can get all      your communiteers around (after they have very thoroughly      washed their hands) and break the curd up by hand to the      size of walnuts.    </p>    <p>      Add 2-1 /4 Ibs. salt to 100 Ibs. curd (say from your 100      gallons milk). Thoroughly mix the salt with the milled      curd.    </p>    <p>      Cool to 75° F (24° C). (You can see the advantage      of having a vat with a cooling jacket.)    </p>    <p>      Put the curd cloths in chessits which should be 15 inches      high and 15 inches in diameter. This will give you a 100      Ibs. cheese, which is a cheese worth having.    </p>    <p>      Put in press and press lightly until the whey begins to      run, then give it 10 cwt. for three or four hours, pull      out, turn, rinse cloth and chessit with warm water, then      give it 25 cwt. Next day remove and bathe cheese in water      at 130° F (54° C) for 30 seconds, return to press      and give it 40 cwt. Third day pull it out again, rub all      over with lard or butter, bandage with clean calico and      press again at two tons.    </p>    <p>      On the fourth day remove from press, bandage again and this      time sew bandage on (some people don't bandage but rub with      lard oil every day for a week). Write date on it, put it on      the shelf, turn it every day for a month and then every      other day for another month. Some people soak it in brine      for three days. The store should be airy and 60° to      80° F (15°to 25° C).    </p>    <p>      All this is a lot of work, but consider, to buy 100 Ibs. of      cheese would cost you, at 654 a pound, $65! For the value      of three cheeses you can buy a cow. And you won't get      cheese at that price now and if you did it would have      nothing like the quality of the cheese you can make for      yourself.    </p>    <p>      I am not suggesting that the lone homesteader should make      cheese on this scale, unless he intends to make it a major      item of his foreign exchange trade. After all, to get 100      gallons of milk in two milkings he will need from twenty to      twenty-five cows in milk. But for communities this might      well be the scale on which cheese would be made, with one      specialist in charge of the making, and perhaps two cheeses      a week being made and butter being made on other days. But      the lone homesteader could well use the same scientific      care with his temperatures and acidities with his cheeses      made from say ten gallons of milk. Sally keeps milk from      more than two milkings to make up enough for a cheese. If      she used the acidimeter test she could do this far more      reliably. And milk kept over from more than two milkings      would certainly not need starter added, it would reach the      required acidity (0.19) without that.    </p>    <p>      When one kind of cheese has been mastered no doubt the      enthusiastic cheesemaker will want to experiment. Gruyere,      and the other holey cheeses, are made with fresh cow's milk      (straight from the cow) with no starter, curdled with      rennet, and kept at 86° F (30° C). The acidity here      is mostly caused by Bocillum bulgoricum and a gas is formed      which causes the holes. Stilton should have extra cream      added (I wonder how many Stiltons do nowadays!) and should      be inoculated with Penicillium roqueforti. (Buy a small      Roquefort cheese to get this.) But when the cheesemaker      gets to this stage he will wish to get some more literature      on the subject anyway.    </p>    <p>      If you want to make yoghourt, get a good live yoghourt, put      some in milk warmed to about blood heat, keep it in a      closed container not too far from the stove, use a little      every day, and add a little fresh milk every day, and go on      as long as it keeps pleasant.    </p>    <p>      A 'Poor Man's Cheese' described in Food in England and      apparently once made in Scotland, which has the advantage      of being a 'one cow' cheese, is made by putting milk in a      pot over a slow fire. Let it curdle, leave in the whey that      night, drain the whey off next morning, cut the curd up and      salt it, tie tightly in a linen cloth, hang to drip all      day, retie tightly and hang up for four weeks. If you hang      it in a net it will have a nice pattern. At the end of the      month it is fit to eat. If some butter be worked into the      curd and the cheese kept for three or four months it will      be very good. I have never tried this but at least it      sounds simple. Any method of preserving the summer milk for      the winter is good.    </p>    <p>      Copyright © 2001-2002, Ogden Publications, Inc.<br />      All rights reserved.    </p>
