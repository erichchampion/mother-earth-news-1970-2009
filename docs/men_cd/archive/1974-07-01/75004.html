                    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" Plitt graduated from college with a      degree in agriculture in 1932. During the years that      followed he made a good many friends and a name for himself      (as a gentleman, inventor and executive) in the field of      bird and animal husbandry and care. At various points in      his career, Mr. Plitt served as Director of Nutritional      Research and Field Services for two of the East's larger      grain mills. He is also the originator of Pride of the      Valley Wild Bird Food and Kleen Kitty cat litter.

It's most important, therefore, not to overstock      a homestead beyond its ability to slake your livestock's      thirst.    </p>    <p>      Here's a good rule of thumb for estimating water needs:    </p>		    <p>      You may, however, have an individual that will consume a      bit more or less, so forgive me if my figures aren't 100%      accurate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: I'm expecting . . . that is, my mare is      due to foal in July. What should I do when she gives      birth?</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWE R: [1] When a foal is born I promptly apply a 2%      tincture of iodine to the navel. This can be done by      putting the disinfectant in a small paper cup and pouring      the contents over the umbilical stump and against the body      wall where the cord was attached. Repeat this procedure for      two or three days to help prevent infection.    </p>    <p>      [2] Insert a glycerine suppository gently into the foal's      rectum to induce a bowel movement and prevent impaction of      meconium (first manure). I've sometimes put on a plastic      glove, greased a finger with Vaseline and inserted it in      the rectum for gentle removal of the blockage.    </p>    <p>      The foal may show signs of difficulty in moving its bowels      (by assuming the typical stance, carrying its tail upright      and wagging it unnaturally). In that case, use a baby      syringe to give an enema of lukewarm water and Ivory      soapsuds.    </p>    <p>      [3] As a precautionary measure, I administer an injection      of tetanus toxoid and one of penicillin in the center of      the neck triangle at birth.    </p>    <p>      [4] The foal should suck from the mother within an hour      after delivery. The first milk (colostrum) released by the      mare-and by womenfolk too-contains a wealth of      nature's own antibodies.    </p>    <p>      Some mares, particularly young maidens, may have trouble      letting down their milk. (I find that an injection of      oxytocin usually does the job in such cases.) Others lack a      strong maternal instinct and may not let their foals nurse.    </p>    <p>      In either event, wash the dam's teats and udder (bag) with      a clean, damp cloth to remove dirt. Then extract her milk      with a human breast pump, available inexpensively at most      drugstores. Pour the liquid into a clean soft drink bottle.      When the container is full, fit it with a sheep nipple      (about 250) and let the foal suck while the milk is still      lukewarm.    </p>    <p>      I recommend feeding the baby every four hours around the      clock for the first few days. This will mean a bit of lost      sleep, but you'll agree that it's worth it to save the      efforts and cost of the eleven months you've already spent      waiting for the foal.    </p>    <p>      Keep trying to induce the mare to let her offspring nurse .      . . which she usually does after a few days or a week.      Then, of course, you can stop being mother" and let nature      take over.    </p>    <p>      If you're not successful in that effort, stand a nanny goat      on an elevated platform and let the foal suck this foster      mother. Her milk is good for the young horse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: I'm planning to raise some baby chicks.      Is there anything I can combine with high-priced starter      food to cut my costs?</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: If there's a chick hatchery nearby, ask the      operators for their infertile eggs or "test-outs": eggs in      which the embryo started to grow and then died. These duds      are usually candied out and removed from the incubators on      a weekly basis, and hatcheries are glad to save a trip to      the dump by giving them away.    </p>    <p>      Hard boil the rejects, chop them fine (shell and all) and      put a small amount on top of the feeder. Later on, when the      chicks are used to the new food, you can simply slice the      eggs. You'll find the birds will love this diet . . . it      will be a circus to watch their antics. Don't overfeed the      chicks, however, but give them just what they'll clean up      in ten or fifteen minutes each day.    </p>    <p>      Another good source of low-cost chick feed is any large      poultry farm where eggs are candied and the "bloodspots"      removed. In most states it's illegal to sell such layings      for human consumption, so they'll generally be given to you      free. Handled in the manner I've described, these too make      an excellent and economical supplement for hogs as well as      for chickens. This is a good example of how a usable waste      product can be recycled to advantage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: Here in the South, where we're farming,      I've heard a lot about "Bermuda grass tremors" affecting      livestock. Can you tell me what this condition is, and what      can be done for stricken animals?</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: "Bermuda grass tremors" is believed to be caused by      a toxin produced by a certain fungus. To my knowledge, no      specific remedy is yet available. The symptoms of affected      horses and cows include muscular tremors, violent shaking      and loss of coordination.    </p>    <p>      Do not attempt to drive such animals . . . coax them with      feed to leave the field at their own pace. Individual      feeding and watering will usually save them. The symptoms      generally disappear over a period of from one to three      weeks.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: Should I feed my hop Glauber's salts? A      farmer told me it was important to keep their bowels      open.</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: This medication-a combination of ingredients      including Epsom salts-is rarely needed if animals are fed      properly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: How long is it practical to keep laying      chickens?</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: I feel that two years is the limit. If a layer's      output in her first year is 200 eggs, her second-year      production will generally be down 20% to 160.    </p>    <p>      In the first season, however, you'll probably get some      peewee and pullet eggs initially, with the size gradually      improving to medium and large . . . whereas a yearling hen,      when she comes out of her molt, will go right into the      laying of large eggs. The monetary return should therefore      be about equal for the two years.    </p>    <p>      Each season thereafter, output will continue to drop about      20% . . . so it's best to eat, can or sell hens when      they've finished their second year of production.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION: Help, quick! How can we keep our hens      from eating their layings? We thought at first they were      doing the damage accidentally when they shared their      favorite nest, but I've caught them pecking and stomping      the eggs. The flock is well fed, and-though we do      give them their own eggshells-we toast the shells in      the oven first and crush them fine. Is there anything we      can do about their frustrating habit?</strong>    </p>    <p>      ANSWER: Here are some suggestions:    </p>    <p>      [1] If you're using regular nests with a top and sides,      tack a piece of burlap or dark cloth over the front and cut      or tear the material into strips. This will allow the hens      to enter and lay their eggs, but will darken the interiors      so they can't see well.    </p>    <p>      [2] Place sawdust, shavings or Stay-Dry (dried, shredded      sugar cane) about two inches deep in the bottoms of the      nests to cushion the eggs from breaking. Don't use straw      unless you must.    </p>    <p>      [3] Gather the eggs every hour in the morning if possible.    </p>    <p>      [4] If you can, get crushed oyster shells at the feedstore      and keep this low-cost supplement in a box in the      chickenhouse where the hens can have access to it.    </p>    <p>      [5] Buy some inexpensive cod-liver oil (low potency, 1,000      units of vitamin A to 100 of vitamin D), put a little on      grain-just enough to coat it-and place the      mixture on top of your laying mash feeder. This will      strengthen the shells of your flock's eggs.    </p>    <p>      [6] As a final resort, you can take a knife and cut about      an eighth of an inch off the upper portion of the hens'      beaks. It will look odd but does much to discourage the      fowls from going on an egg-eating spree.    </p>
