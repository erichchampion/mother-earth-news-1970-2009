                    <p>      OK, all you vegetarians. In the past we've run a number of      articles for you, including the massive 15-page FOOD THING      back in NO. 4. We certainly respect your viewpoint . . .      but now it's time to give equal play to all the folks      who've been raising homestead animals for food. It's time,      in short, to lay down a concise set of instructions for the      home freezing, smoking, canning and preserving of meat.      Meat eaters, take note . . . vegetarians, skip the next 10      pages!    </p>    <p>      Our special thanks to Irma Mills of Watertown, Tennessee,      who turned us on to Morton Salt's excellent booklet, A      COMPLETE GUIDE TO HOME MEAT CURING (available for $1.25      from Morton Salt Company, P.O. Box 355, Argo, Illinois      60501). And Extra Special Thanks to Murray J. Pearthree,      Morton Salt Regional Sales Manager, for granting us written      permission to reprint from that booklet.    </p>    <p>      We'll be publishing other sections frorn the Morton Salt      handbook in future issues . . . but we'd advise you to zip      $1.25 into the mail and add the handy little manual to your      farmstead bookshelf right now if you need immediate help      cutting up and curing pork, beef, veal, lamb, poultry or      wild game.    </p>        <h3>      PLANNING FOR BUTCHERING    </h3>    <p>      Beginning with the warm carcass of a freshly butchered hog      or other meat animal, up to the time you are ready to cook      the meat weeks or months later, you are dealing with a      valuable and perishable food product.    </p>    <p>      Strict attention to correct methods, cleanliness in      handling the meat, the proper tools and equipment are all      very important. Indifferent methods, or lack of proper      attention to important details never helps you to turn out      high quality, cured meats that keep well.    </p>    <p>      A shed or building properly equipped for the job, a small      pen along side for penning up hogs before they are      butchered, a handy water heating arrangement with scalding      vat, a heavy table, a convenient means of swinging the      carcass with a block and tackle, heavy single trees and      gambrel sticks, and a good set of butchering tools make up      the initial equipment that will help you do the job easily,      quickly, and efficiently.    </p>    <p>      A good set of butchering tools should consist of a sticking      knife, skinning knife, boning knife, butcher knife, steel,      cleaver, bell scrapers, meat saw, and meat hooks.      Additional instruments that are very useful are a meat      pump, thermometer and meat needle, for sewing rolled cuts.    </p>    <h3>      BUTCHERING    </h3>    <p>      <em>Pork is our most nutritious<br />      meat and</em> <em>produces a higher<br />      per cent of edible meat<br />      products than any ether<br />      meat animal.</em>    </p>    <p>      There is no section of the country where hogs cannot be      profitably grown for the home meat supply. Hogs reproduce      faster and in greater numbers than any other meat animals      and most efficiently convert grain and other feeds into      edible meat products.    </p>    <p>      The following table shows the weight of the different cuts      from a 225 lb. and 250 lb. hog. It also shows what per cent      of the carcass the different cuts represent.    </p>        <h3>      SELECTION OF HOGS FOR BUTCHERING    </h3>    <p>      High quality meat with a sweet, rich, full-bodied flavor is      always worth a premium, and hogs that produce this kind of      meat should be the only ones butchered and cured for home      use.    </p>    <p>      Good meat, of course, depends upon many factors, and one      important factor is the kind of hogs butchered. Thrifty,      properly fattened hogs, weighing from 180 to 250 lbs. and      from eight to ten months old are the best ones for home      butchering. Hogs of this size are more easily handled and      the meat chills out more quickly. They produce medium      weight cuts which are more suitable for the average family,      and medium weight cuts will cure quicker and more uniformly      than heavier cuts. Medium weight hams, shoulders, and bacon      are finer in texture and flavor and are of better quality      than those from older, heavier hogs. Non-thrifty shoats, or      heavy 400 to 600 lb. hogs do not produce the best type of      meat for home curing. Also, it costs more to produce each      pound of meat in heavier hogs than in lighter ones.    </p>    <h3>      CARE OF HOGS BEFORE BUTCHERING    </h3>    <p>      When does meat curing start-after the meat is cut up      and salted down, or before the hogs are killed?    </p>    <p>      Of course, the actual curing starts when the meat is salted      down, but, more broadly speaking, the result of the cure      begins with the live hog because the quality of the      finished meat depends a lot on how the hogs were handled      when butchered, bled, cleaned, and chilled.    </p>    <p>      Thousands of hams, shoulders, and bacon sides that could      just as easily have been high quality meat are often low in      quality. Also, actual souring has been brought about      through improper butchering. The prevention of meat      spoilage and also the foundation of quality meat begins      with the handling of the live hog. For this reason the wise      thing to do is to practically start curing the meat at the      time the hogs are killed-which, of course, means to      do every step in the butchering and curing job properly.    </p>    <p>      Hogs that are to be butchered should be confined in a small      pen for two or three days before butchering and for 24      hours prior to killing should be given no food but should      have plenty of fresh water. Hogs should never be butchered      when they are over-heated, excited, or fatigued, but when      they are perfectly quiet and rested. When the body      temperature is above normal the meat easily becomes      feverish. This is especially true of large or fat hogs or      hogs butchered in warmer sections. Proper chilling of meat      that was in a feverish condition when butchered is      difficult; and meat that is not properly chilled cannot be      properly cured. Also, this same feverish condition of the      meat can easily be the direct cause of souring or taint.      The primary cause of low quality meat and meat spoilage is      due to allowing the natural forms of bacteria to develop      and multiply.    </p>        <p>      The different natural bacteria which are present in the      blood and tissues of live hogs must be prevented from      multiplying and must be held in check until the meat has      taken the cure. Meat curing is a race between these      different types of bacterial action and the curing action      of the salt and other curing ingredients. Also the job of      cleaning is made much easier when the stomach contains a      minimum amount of food.    </p>    <p>      The important factors in butchering and curing meat in      order to have high quality meat without souring or taint      are as follows:    </p>    <p>      1. Hogs that are quietly handled.<br />      2. A thorough bleed.<br />      3. Quick and efficient chilling.<br />      4. Cleanliness in handling the meat.<br />      5. Proper application of the salt.<br />      6. Overhauling during the cure.<br />      7. Proper washing, drying, and wrapping.    </p>    <h3>      STICKING IS THE BEST METHOD OF KILLING    </h3>        <p>      To butcher by sticking only is the most practical,      efficient method of killing hogs, and also the most humane.      It is best not to stun or shoot a hog before sticking.    </p>    <p>      With hogs in a small pen and a block and tackle with      hoisting arrangement nearby, loop a chain around one hind      leg and draw the hog backward through the gate of the pen      and up for swinging. The chain should be looped between the      hock and the hoof in order not to bruise the ham shank. The      most satisfactory bleed can be secured when a hog is swung      head downward when stuck.    </p>    <p>      If an arrangement for swinging the hog is not convenient,      then roll the hog on its back and stick on the ground. One      man stands straddle of the hog and holds the forefeet while      the other holds the chin down and sticks. Whether the hog      is stuck from a hanging position or on the ground, the      principle and method of sticking are the same. The diagram      above shows the principle of proper sticking.    </p>    <p>      A short incision is made in the throat in front of the      point of the breast bone. With the point of the knife      against the under side of the breast bone as shown in      position No. 1 in the diagram, the knife is inserted to      position No. 2. This severs the large branching vein and      artery which lie immediately beneath the point of the      breast bone. The knife movement is made downward and      forward. Finishing the stick, as shown in position No. 3,      keep the knife squarely in the center when sticking and do      not twist it, If the knife is twisted, it will result in      shoulder sticks and necessitate heavy trimming when the      carcass is cut up. The knife should not be inserted too far      back or it will enter the chest cavity which will cause      internal bleeding and blood clots.    </p>    <h3>      DO NOT TRY TO STICK THE HEART    </h3>        <p>      Very often when sticking hogs someone will make an effort      to stick the heart. This should not be done as the heart      should be left uninjured in order that it may continue to      function properly and pump out the blood as rapidly as      possible. To reach the heart the sticking cut would have to      be made very deep, which is almost sure to result in      internal bleeding. To prevent internal bleeding the      sticking should merely sever the large vein and artery well      in front of the heart. A quick and thorough bleed is one of      the foundation steps in putting up high quality meat. Too      much emphasis cannot be placed on the importance of a good      bleed. Shooting or stunning before sticking should always      be avoided unless the hog is very wild. A good bleed is      difficult to obtain when hogs are stunned or shot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SCALDING</strong>    </p>            <p>      Good equipment helps make the job easier, and a part of the      equipment should be a scalding tank with a fire pit      underneath for heating the water, and a heavy table for      scraping alongside the tank. Where this type of tank is not      available the next best arrangement is to heat the water in      a large open kettle and use a barrel for scalding. The      barrel should be set at about a 45° angle at one end of      the scraping table, or if a hoist is available the barrel      may be set upright under the hoist to save lifting.    </p>    <p>      Plenty of hot water at a temperature of about 150° and      a little lye or wood ashes added make scalding easier. In      very cold weather water should be about 160°. Keep the      hog moving while in the water and remove as soon as the      hair slips readily. By using a good thermometer you can      always know when the water is at the correct temperature,      which not only makes scalding easier, but eliminates the      chance of setting the hair.    </p>    <p>      It is good practice to scald the head first while the hind      legs are dry, then reverse the hog and place the hook in      the lower jaw and scald the hind quarters. Where z large      number of hogs are to be butchered and scalded at the same      time a water heating tank with a fire underneath will be      found very convenient as more than one hog can be scalded      at once.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SCRAPING</strong>    </p>        <p>      Bell scrapers are the most satisfactory tools for scraping      hogs. A good quality bell scraper pays for itself in work      and time saved many times over. The head and feet should be      scraped first as these parts cool quickly. The scraping      strokes should be made with the lay of the hair and it will      come off easier. As soon as the hair is removed, pour some      hot water on the carcass and place the bell of the scraper      flat against the skin and move the scraper in a rotary      fashion. This will massage out much of the dirt and scurf      from the skin. A stiff bristle or wire brush is handy in      cleaning up the carcass. Remove stray bristles with a      little hot water and sharp knife or singe.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WORKING OUT TENDONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Make a deep cut up the center of the hind legs from the      foot toward the hock. In each incision three tendons will      be found. Work these out with the fingers and hook over the      gambrel stick or over the hooks in a short singletree. A      block and tackle or chain hoist for swinging hogs makes      butchering much easier. After swinging, wash the carcass      clean with hot water and scrape. Then wash with cold water.      Before making any of the cuts or opening the carcass be      sure that all knives are clean and well scalded. Butchering      tools that are dropped should be rescalded before using.    </p>    	     <p>      <strong>REMOVING THE HEAD</strong>    </p>            <p>      Removing the head first gets it out of the way and is an      aid to rapid chilling. It also permits the complete      drainage of blood from the carcass. Make a cut just above      the ears at the first joint of the backbone and all the way      across the back of the neck. Sever the gullet and windpipe      to let the head drop, then pull down on the ears and      continue the cut around the ears to the eyes and then to      the point of the jaw bone. This lets the head come free but      leaves the jowls on the carcass. The head should be washed      and trimmed as soon as possible. This method of taking off      the head is very practical. It makes a neater job and helps      get a better chill.    </p>                <p>      Score the belly by making a slight incision from a point      between the hams to the sticking cut in the throat, but be      careful and do not cut through the belly wall. Now place      the knife in the sticking cut at the throat with the point      against the backbone. Cut upward, using the knife as a pry      to split the breast bone and divide the first pair of ribs.      This is pictured in the center illustration above.    </p>    <p>      Be careful in splitting the upper portion of the breast      bone not to cut into the stomach. This portion is thin and      the stomach lies immediately beneath. With older or heavier      hogs a saw may be needed to split the breast bone. The      blood that, has accumulated in the chest cavity will drain      out when the breast bone is split and you can tell -whether      you did a good job of sticking by the amount of blood in      the chest cavity when the breast is opened. If the hog was      swung before sticking and the vein and artery severed well      in front of the heart, very little blood will be left in      the chest cavity to drain out. Getting a good bleed is very      important as meat can not be properly chilled and cured      without being properly bled.<br />    </p>            <p>      After the breast bone is split, make a short incision in      the abdominal wall near the top. Then place the hand      clasping the knife handle inside the abdominal wall, with      the blade pointing out. Let the fist that grips the handle      drop down until the knife blade slants upward. The cutting      is done with the heel of the blade and the fist crowds the      intestines away from the outer edge as the ripping is      continued downward. When the belly wall is cut through, the      intestines will fall forward and downward, but the attached      muscle fibre will not let them fall far.    </p>    <p>      This method of ripping the belly is the safest and quickest      way to do it and you can work without fear of cutting the      intestines. It is awkward and slow work to try to rip the      belly with the point turned inward as the slightest slip of      the knife can easily slit one of the intestines, and cause      contamination.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPLITTING THE AITCH BONE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Make a cut in the lean part of the meat squarely in the      center between the two hams. When the aitch bone is      reached, the point of the knife is placed against the      center seam of the bone. By striking the butt of the knife      handle with the palm of the hand the seam of the hitch bone      is split quite easily.    </p>    <p>      Another method is to bear down with a straight cut with the      point of the knife in order to split the hitch bone. Either      method is good. With older hogs it may be necessary to use      a saw to split the aitch bone.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LOOSENING THE BUNG</strong>    </p>        <p>      Grasp the bung gut just below split in the aitch bone and      loosen upward toward end of bung. Then start in the front      and cut completely around bung end. Securely tie the end      with a cord and pull bung out and down, cutting around it      where it does not pull loose.    </p>        <p>      <strong>REMOVING THE ENTRAILS</strong>    </p>        <p>      When the bung gut is worked down toward the entrails, the      entire mass of entrails should be worked outward and      downward leaving as much fat as possible along the      backbone. The kidneys are left in the leaf fat which      surrounds them. The stomach will be found on the left side      and the liver on the right side.    </p>    <p>      Take a firm hold on the mass of entrails and roll them      forward along with stomach and liver. When this is done,      the diaphragm, which separates the chest from the body      cavity, will be exposed. Through the center of the      diaphragm the gullet will be found leading to the stomach.    </p>    <p>      It should be severed at this point permitting the entire      mass to come free.    </p>    <p>      Place the mass of entrails on a table or in a tub. Cut off      the liver and trim out the gall bladder. Wash the liver in      clear, cool water. Next remove the spleen or "melt."      Covering the stomach and attached to its outer border is a      thin layer of "web fat." This should be trimmed out, washed      in cold water, and hung up to chill as you may want to use      it for lard. The stomach should be cut loose and tied off.    </p>    <p>      To remove the heart and lungs from the carcass make an      incision through the diaphragm where the red muscular      portion joins the white connective tissue. This exposes the      heart and lungs, which should be pulled downward and cut      free from the backbone. The heart is trimmed up, washed and      chilled.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PREPARING CASINGS</strong>    </p>    <p>      If the intestines are to be run, this should be done while      they are still warm. The start should be made where they      leave the stomach. If the intestines are to be used for      casings, the end should be tied and the thumb and      forefinger of the left hand placed along the "ruffle fat."      With the right hand the intestines are torn from the      attached fat.    </p>    <p>      Only the small intestines are generally used for casings,      so when the large intestine is reached the fat is removed,      the small intestine tied off, and the large intestine      discarded. The ruffle fat should not be used for high,      grade lard but is good for making soap grease.    </p>    <p>      If the casings are to be used, the contents should be      carefully stripped out and the casings thoroughly washed.      Then reverse them by turning up a fold at the end of the      casings like the cuff on a pair of trousers, and pour warm      water into this fold. It is best to have one person hold      the intestines, one to pour the water, and a third to      "feed" in the intestines as the weight of the water      reverses them. To make the job easier cut the intestines      into several lengths. The mucous coat, which is now on the      outside after the intestines are reversed, can be scraped      off with the back of the knife blade, or scraped through a      sharpened notched stick by drawing the casing between the      notch and the thumb. To do a good job of cleaning this      operation should be repeated several times, and the casings      washed in lukewarm water. If the casings are not to be used      at once, they should be packed in dry salt until they are      to be used.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPLITTING THE BACKBONE</strong>    </p>        <p>      Split the hog carcass while it is still warm. This helps      hasten chilling as more surface is exposed. After washing      inside the carcass split it down the middle of the backbone      with a saw or cleaver. Leave about 15 inches of skin uncut      at the shoulders to keep the carcass from separating or      slipping off the gambrel or singletree. You will find that      center splitting is better because it gives you more useful      finished cuts.    </p>        <p>      <strong>FISTING OUT LEAF LARD AND PACING HAMS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hold the end of the leaf fat with one hand and with the      fist of the other loosen the leaf fat by fisting upward.      The leaf fat is easily removed while the carcass is warm      and its removal helps the carcass chill out quicker.    </p>    <p>      For the same reasons, the hams should be faced while they      are still warm. Start the cut at the flank and continue by      following the curvature of the ham to remove the outer      layer of fat and skin from the inside of the hams. The thin      fibrous membrane next to the lean meat will shrink to it,      giving a smooth appearance to the hams after they are      cured. This membrane also protects the hams.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CHILLING</strong>    </p>    <p>      The carcass is now ready for chilling. It is impossible to      do a neat job of trimming if cutting up the carcass is      undertaken before it is thoroughly chilled out.    </p>        <p>      A quick and thorough chill is a very important factor in      turning out good meat. With the head removed, the hams      faced, and the leaf fat fisted loose and the carcass split      down the center of the backbone, you can readily see how      open it is for chilling. The air can circulate freely to      each part of the carcass. Thus the weather is used to full      advantage for getting a good chill. About 24 hours are      necessary for proper chilling, and a good rule to follow in      warmer sections is to kill in the afternoon and have the      cool night ahead for starting the chill.    </p>    <p>      For proper chilling the temperature in the center of the      hams should be lowered to around 33 to 35°. A      thermometer inserted into the center of one ham will show      you when the meat is properly chilled.    </p>    <p>      If the weather is not cool enough to insure a satisfactory      chill, the iced brine method of chilling is a good plan to      follow. By cutting each half of the carcass as illustrated      below you can quickly separate it into a few major pieces.      Fill a clean barrel about a third full of water, stirring      in the water about three pounds of Morton Salt. Put in some      large chunks of ice and the pieces of meat. This iced brine      will be colder than ordinary ice water and will      satisfactorily chill the meat even in mild weather. Another      method is to place a layer of chipped ice on a clean      surface, spreading the carcass out on the ice and putting      additional chipped ice on top. The iced brine method in the      barrel, however, is more efficient and gives a better      chill.    </p>    <p>      Meat should not be cut up and put in cure until it is      thoroughly chilled and all the animal heat is out. A good      job of cutting cannot be done on warm meat. Neither should      salt be applied on warm meat. Very often home cured meat      has been made inferior in quality and actual loss caused by      cutting up and salting meat that still has the animal heat      in it. A good cure follows a good bleed and good chill.    </p>
