When they rested, they were out straight. . .      sometimes half submerged in mud. When they scratched      themselves against a corner of their shelter, their      enjoyment of the itch and the scratch was both comic and      complete. Shower baths from the sprinkling can on hot      summer days made them all but sigh with satisfaction. Both      pigs had the sense to step on a cornstalk to make it easier      to eat and it wasn't long before they learned to recognize      the peculiar clank of their feed pail handle (as opposed to      the clatter of the goats' pans). The shoats would always      come running, snorting and hollering, when they heard the      bucket's hopeful sound.</em><br />    </p>    <div class="image">      <img src="../images/017-070-01.gif" alt="017-070-01.gif" width="324" height="195" />    </div>    <p>      <em>The trough we made for our pigs to eat from is the      traditional "V" design with a wide-stance board nailed to      each end to seal the container and prevent its tipping. The      two struts across the top reinforce the structure.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The barrow usually hogged all three sections of the      trough-with his feet in one as he ate from the other      two-and, for the whole time they shared quarters, he      was much bigger than the gilt. This worked out all right,      though, since we wanted to have the hogs butchered a few      months apart . . . and the she-pig ate well and grew large      after the barrow left.</em>    </p>    </div>    <p>      Last summer we raised two pigs on our acre. We had no barn,      fancy feeders or waterers. No pasture either. What we      <em>did</em> have was plenty of weeds and garden leftovers      . . . and what we ended up with was plenty of pork. Yum.      The real stuff, lean and delicious, and it cost us an      average of only 37 cents a pound.    </p>    <p>      We had several things in mind when, bumbling amateurs that      we were, we decided to have a go at raising our own pork      chops:    </p>    <p>      1) (And carrying the most weight) . . . We'd read enough      about hormones, antibiotics and heavily sprayed feed given      to commercially raised animals to want something better for      our family and friends; 2) We wanted to see how fully pigs      would use up the by-products of gardening, canning and      foraging; 3) All we knew about hogs was what we'd read . .      . we wanted to see how they would respond to us and each      oth er;    </p>    <p>      4) We thought we might even save some money.    </p>    <p>      Our plan was to buy shoats (feeder pigs) in early spring,      fatten them up over the summer at the slow but steady pace      of whatever was available and have them butchered and      frozen in the fall. That's pretty much the way it worked      out.    </p>    <p>      While getting ready for our venture, we did a lot of      reading. The most down-home, reassuring sources were parts      of COUNTRYSIDE Magazine, an article by Victor Croley in the      November <em>1968</em> issue of ORGANIC GARDENING AND      FARMING and a small green book we found in a secondhand      bookstore: <em>HOME PORK PRODUCTION</em> by John Smedley      (Published by Orange Judd Publishing Co., N.Y.,      <em>1946).</em>    </p>    <p>      We also found two helpful pamphlets at the local feed      store: "The Purina Hog Program Book" and "Jasper, an Inside      Look at a Modern Meat Hog". Both are free. You can just      skip over the chemical trivia.    </p>    <p>      Your local county agent probably can round out your      hograising library with another useful publication:      Farmer's Bulletin <em>#2166,</em> "Swine Production,"      published by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.    </p>    <p>      To raise a pig, of course, you must first get one and we      began scanning the want-ad sections of the local newspapers      in early March. Feeder pigs were few and far between, so we      called a farmer from whom we had once bought persimmons. As      it happened, the man had an odd pair of shoats that were      out of step with the others . . . a gilt (young female) and      a barrow (castrated male). Each weighed about <em>40</em>      pounds and we paid <em>$14</em> apiece for them. No      bargain, but we'd rather give the profit to a family farmer      than to a mass producer.    </p>    <p>      In April and again during the fall-after we'd bought      ours-we noted a number of newspaper ads offering      suckling and feeder pigs for as little as $11.00 . . . but      we had no real regrets. If we'd been too hasty in making a      deal for our porkers it had only been because we'd been      anxious to get started and make our first mistakes.      Besides, if we'd purchased one of the bargain babies in the      autumn, we couldn't have kept it over winter without a      barn. (We <em>were</em> tempted to get one and keep it the      summer kitchen, but we didn't. Perhaps it's good to run out      of pork and get hungry for the next batch.)    </p>    <p>      Although most everything else on our homestead has a title,      we agreed from the beginning not to name the pigs. We      didn't want to raise them to 250 pounds only to have to      keep them on as pets. Still, we had to call them      <em>something</em> . . . and "Himself" and "Herself" were      as close as we came to acknowledging Pig Soul.    </p>    <p>      Since we had decided to raise our own pork to save money      and to produce meat as free as possible of harmful      residues, we substituted hand-cut weeds-mostly      plantain, dandelion, lamb's quarters and amaranth-for      much of the bagged feed we would otherwise have had to buy      the animals. After coarse chopping the wild salad, we      moistened it and dumped it in the shoats' trough.    </p>    <p>      When we first offered the scavenged greens to Herself and      Himself in April we mixed a handful of ground pig feed into      the leaves to convince the shoats that the salad really was      for them. The hogs caught on fast and spent most of spring      and early summer devouring burlap sackfuls of the bountiful      weed crop we gathered from unsprayed roadsides and      hedgerows.    </p>    <p>      Our home-grown comfrey came into season in May and we were      soon cutting, moistening, sprinkling with feed and      presenting our little bottomless pits with one-half bushel      of this fast growing, high protein crop a day.    </p>    <p>      We also grew mangel beets (a large, coarse variety for      stock) and fed the vegetable chopped and mixed with greens.      The beet that yielded best for us was Golden Tankard, from      the Olds Seed Company (Olds doesn't charge for packing and      handling . . . good folks).    </p>    <p>      Then there were the garden extras: the odd beets and      carrots, flowered broccoli we'd somehow missed, squashy      tomatoes, bolted lettuce, old corn, extra soybeans . . .      and all the vegetable trimmings, banana peels and melon      rinds. Down the hatch! You could just see the cycle of it      all. Fabulous.    </p>    <p>      The processing that went on in our big rangy farm-type      kitchen during the summer produced additional buckets and      pails of byproducts: tomato pulp, apple pomace, coarse beet      leaves, pea pods, cabbage leaves, berry rejects. The pigs      eagerly turned it all into pork. About the only two things      we found they didn't like (and believe me, we tried lots of      different menus!) were mashed elderberries and sauerkraut.    </p>    <p>      At about that same time, the summer spurt of egg-laying      enthusiasm on the part of our hens was filling our baskets      and pockets to overflowing . . . so on more than one      morning, the shoats started their day with eggs just as we      did!    </p>    <p>      In August, when many weeds were going to seed (and were      therefore less useful as fodder), we continued to feed the      pigs well on other sources we had up our sleeve.    </p>    <p>      From our goats-Annie and Sonya, who had freshened in      the spring and whose kids were weaned-there was loads      of milk. On days when the fridge was full, I'd bypass the      filtering and cooling processes and take the morning's      milking straight to the pigs. Their enjoyment was noisy and      delightful.    </p>    <p>      Our summer and early fall foraging jaunts yielded baskets      full of windfall apples and pears. We ate and preserved the      best ones and fed the others to Himself and Herself. Twice,      we found free-for-the-picking fruit advertised in a local      paper. In both cases, after plucking what we wanted from      the trees, we stayed a few extra minutes to get the drops      on the ground. Raking seems to be a nuisance that the      orchard owners want to avoid and our porkers thrived on the      soft fruit.    </p>    <p>      By September, many of the weeds that had gone to seed were      surrounded by colonies of young; tender greens and      dandelions appeared on our pigs' menu again.    </p>    <p>      During October and November, we did lots of stubbling:      gleaning dropped corn that had been missed by the      mechanical pickers in our neighbor's field. (Of course we      asked permission.) We found it best to husk the ears as we      picked them up, for often they were damp and might      otherwise have molded when we stored the crop in bins in      the garage. We talked about making a little homesteadsize      crib by wrapping our rototiller crate with fencing, but . .      . well, we're still talking about it. Fall came on fast.      The pigs got their money's worth from each ear of corn we      gave them when the ground was hard . . . but when their      enclosure turned to thick, slurpy mud after heavy rains,      too many cobs went to China. The only thing to do was to      feed the grain shelled in the trough.    </p>    <h3>      keener memorial a-frame    </h3>        <p>      <em>Our pigs lived in the Keener Memorial A-frame, so named      from the inscription on several of the old boards that went      into their house. We can't see that their dignified label      made any impression on the porkers, but it sure saved us      money when we were building their quarters.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Mike made the structure from boards and beams that were      being discarded by a gravestone company (hence the      inscription), and by a man who had dismantled his old front      porch. Both sources were glad to have us-rather than      the trash man-take the excellent wood they didn't      want <strong>.</strong> As we carried it away, our salvage      stuck way out the back of our VW squareback. We hung a red      flag on it and sang all the way home.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The A-frame is 6 feet long and stands 4 feet, 2 inches      tall on a base 5 feet wide. It's closed on three sides and      partly open to the south. The piglets were cold when we      first got them and they coughed (an oddly human-sounding      cough) so we piled bales of straw in and around the A-frame      for them to burrow in. Herself and Himself were so thorough      about this tunneling, for the first few days we'd often      think they had escaped . . . until we heard them snorting      contentedly under the bedding.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The shoats' cottage was set in the same fenced-in      enclosure that surrounds our goat shed and rabbit hutches.      We call it the Peaceable Kingdom. To keep things peaceable      and a little less muddy, we partitioned off half the open      area for the new babies with parts of old gravestone crates      and such.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The 5-foot fencing, hooked to steel posts, that      surrounds the hog lot is strong but fairly open at the      bottom. We'd been told that a ring in the nose would      prevent each pig from rooting, but somehow we didn't have      the heart to do that so-at first-we put beams      and logs along the lower edge of the barrier to keep      Herself and Himself from nosing under. Then we bought a      secondhand electric fence charger for $10.00. From then on      a single strand of live wire a few inches above the ground      on the inside of their enclosure kept the shoats in their      corner.</em><br />    </p>    <h3>pig meat</h3>    <p>      <em>The barrow weighed 218 lbs. and dressed out to 134 lbs.      of meat, scrapple, sausage, etc., not counting lard.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The gilt weighed 280 lbs. and dressed out 170 lbs., not      counting lard.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>TOTAL MEAT . . . . . . . . . . 134 + 170 = 304 lbs.      Plus 60 lbs. free lard<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Any way you figure it, the meat cost us $.37 a pound.      (What does ham cost in your stupormarket?)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>NOTE: The Purina Modified Complete Program, for      producers with some grain, states that it should require      678 pounds of their feed to raise a pig from 50 to 250      pounds. We fed less of the commercial chow (600 lbs.) to      raise two hogs from 40 pounds each to an average of 249      pounds each. Foraging and recycling leftovers really does      pay!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>ALSO . . . Using our procedure and costs, but doing      your own butchering, you can nearly halve our costs. . .      yes, you can raise your own pork for $.19 a pound! (304      lbs. for $58, the cost of 2 pigs and the bagged feed.) This      is a case where keeping things small saves money (if you      had a lot of pigs, for instance, you couldn't gather greens      for them yourself. You could put them out to pasture,      though, if you had the land).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>OR . . . A compromise . . . butcher your own hog and      have the ham and bacon commercially cured at a cost of $.10      a pound. For 90 lbs. of ham and bacon this would raise your      cost to $.22 a pound.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>JUST . . . Borrowing or bartering the use of a truck      for the trip to the butcher (at least in our case) would      have shaved costs to $.35 a pound.</em>    </p>    <h3>pig figures</h3>        <p>      Lucky for us, a mill in the nearby village of Rheems sells      feed without hormones, antibiotics or preservatives. We      bought their hog chow by the 100-pound bag even though we      scarcely ever fed it straight. Mainly, we used the      commercial ration to thicken whey left from making cream      cheese out of yogurt and to dress up the salad greens . . .      which allowed us to raise two pigs on less than the amount      of commercial feed ordinarily needed for one. Our      home-grown fodder and wild greens, table and garden      surplus, milk, eggs, foraged corn and apples made the      difference.    </p>    <p>      Mineral supplements helped the shoats make good use of      their food. We tossed wood ashes to the hogs and from time      to time added a trace of mineral powder to their diet. The      rooting instinct helps to keep swine well supplied with      micronutrients, too. Fresh good soil abounds in trace      minerals and natural antibiotics.    </p>    <p>      We had no way of computing the daily protein intake for      Himself and Herself . . . maybe we sacrificed some      efficiency in feed conversion, but ease is important to us,      too. We just tried to make sure we offered a healthy      protein serving each day . . . usually from more than one      source: comfrey, eggs, milk, alfalfa leaves left by the      goats, whey, soybeans. We felt that such a wild variety      eaten over a period of days would strike some kind of      balance.    </p>    <p>      The goats, chickens and rabbits-much as we love      'em-have their own persnickety appetites for scraps      and no other animal on the homestead is so wholehearted      about leftovers of all kinds as pigs. When our hogs were      suddenly gone in November I really missed their guzzling,      gobbling enthusiasm for our mixed offerings.    </p>    <p>      Admittedly, there <em>were</em> days when we felt we      existed for the pigs rather than the other way around.      Especially in August, when they were getting large and      hungry.    </p>    <p>      Pennsylvania's wettest summer in years-and the mud      that left the hogs' corner awash and well-seasoned with      indelible pig manure-made caring for the animals all      the more exasperating. When Himself and Herself saw me      coming with the dinner pail they'd slosh their way to the      trough and spatter me with the gooey mixture. It turned      into a race to see who could get there first. Made us all      look pretty silly. Finally, I took to wrapping a burlap      sack around me at feeding time to help cut down on the      extra wash.    </p>    <p>      Annoying as it all was, it still hasn't turned us off on      porkers. Mike plans a network of ditches around their yard      to divert runoff from the slight slope above. And we      couldn't possibly (or could we?) have another summer with      so much rain!    </p>    <p>      If we'd been able to keep our shoats on a solid surface,      with straw bedding, we would have lost much less of the      manure. Hog manure is heavy stuff, any way you look at it.      We mucked out some for spreading in the corn patch and      around the rhubarb but there was lots more in there, all      mixed with mud that we still don't know how to handle. Any      suggestions? Yeah. We could grow corn there . . . but it's      the only place we have for keeping pigs.    </p>    <p>      The odor of Essence of Hog, by the way, wasn't the problem      we had thought it might be, even though the pen is within      50 feet of our home. It's downwind and the northwest breeze      blew it away. Plus . . . we weren't in the house very much      anyhow!    </p>    <p>      We decided to have the barrow butchered in September, even      though he was slightly on the small side. This would give      us more of a spread between the two and, therefore, fresher      meat and less trouble fitting the supply into our      freezer.We considered dressing the animals out ourselves,      but felt we weren't quite ready for that. As far as we're      concerned, the butcher earned his fee.    </p>    <p>      "Was it hard," you ask, "parting with an animal you'd cared      for?"    </p>    <p>      To be honest, it wasn't really the heavy feeling we'd      expected. The arrangement between us and the pigs      (admittedly a unilateral agreement) was-from the      beginning-good care, food and occasional conversation      in trade for meat. And we were so busy with garden, goats,      haying and canning we really didn't have time to make pets      of Himself and Herself as we had thought we might. After      the half-hour struggle to get Him on the truck, all the      while keeping Her in the pen, our feelings were more those      of relief than regret! "<br />    </p>    <p>      We had planned to wait until December to have the gilt      dressed, but the weather turned very cold, meaning that      feed would go mostly to maintenance, and the butcher told      us he'd be too busy with deer after Thanksgiving to do it      then, anyway. So we had Her-all 280 pounds-done      in mid-November. The butcher said, "They were nice pigs."      We felt we'd been praised by an expert.    </p>    <p>      But the best reward has been in the eating: <em>lean</em>      pork . . . meaty sausage . . . unbelievably fragrant ham .      . . spicy scrapple . . . abundant lard. The meat was      perfect with Mike's homemade sauerkraut and small bits and      pieces of it made scrumptious soybean casseroles, omelets      and Chinese dishes with mung bean sprouts. Having our own      soybeans, eggs and vegetables helped us get more mileage      out of the pork, too.    </p>    <p>      We figure our pork cost an average of 37 cents a pound.      That's allowing for all roasts, bacon, ham scrapple and      sausage . . . but not counting the lard, which is thrown in      free. Free or not, homestead lard <em>does</em> have value.      Our daughter, Mary Grace, made enough soap from the first      lard to last us a year and we kept the second batch handy      (stored in our cold summer kitchen) for cooking use all      winter.    </p>    <p>      Was it worth it? I suppose the best answer is to tell you      that we've already embarked on our second adventure with      walking pork chops. If we can do it, lots of other      improvisers can too! Enjoy!    </p>    <h3>pig facts</h3>    <p>      <em>To produce one pound of protein for man, a hog must eat      8.3 lbs. of protein while a steer must consume 21.4.</em>    </p>    <p>      (From <em>DIET FOR A SMALL PLANET</em> by Frances Moore      Lappe)    </p>    <p>      <em>Fair average gain for a pig up to 225 lbs. is one pound      a day,</em> full <em>fed from birth. Cost of gain increases      with age, as in other farm animals.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>One pound of feed daily per 100 lbs. live weight is      needed to maintain a hog at constant weight.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Young pigs need more protein than mature hogs.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>High oil feeds-such as soybeans, peanuts,      etc.-produce soft pork when fed heavily.</em>    </p>    <p>      (Above four points from <em>PORK PRODUCTION</em> by Wm.

One half acre is enough for one or two pigs with a      rotation plan and some extra grain fed. The manure they      leave is worth several dollars an acre.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A good mineral mixture:<br />      10 lbs. steamed bone meal<br />      10 lbs. limestone or wood ashes<br />      5 lbs. salt</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Cook all potatoes and peelings fed to pigs and the      animals will eat more. Don't feed 'em potato sprouts      though.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We fed Himself and Herself at least three times a day .      . . with snacks of odd tomatoes, fresh-pulled weeds and      such tossed in between. We've since read that overfed pigs      use slightly more feed per 100 lbs. of gain than those who      receive just an adequate diet. So I think we'll take those      desperate grunts a little less seriously next time. On the      other hand, porkers have such small stomachs, when bulky      greens are being substituted for more concentrated food      they need to eat more often.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Swine suffer from heat and need plenty of water in      summer.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>A hog's appetite and digestive tract is more like that      of a man than most other domestic farm animals.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pigs will leave their droppings in one corner of their      yard if given a chance. They try very hard to keep their      sleeping quarters clean.</em>    </p>    <p>      Meat conformation standards from "Jasper, an Inside Look at      a Modern Meat Hog", published by American Cyanamid Co.,      1971, available in feed stores free.<br />      Most other Pig Facts from <em>HOME PORK PRODUCTION</em> by      John Smedley, published by Orange Judd Pub.
