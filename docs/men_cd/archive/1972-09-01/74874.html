            		        <p>      SPECIAL NOTE: <em>GROW IT!</em> is a big book and even if a      chunk this size were to be run in issue after issue after      issue of MOTHER, it would take over two years to put the      complete volume in your hands. If you haven't got two years      to play around with, we recommend that you truck on down to      your nearest book store and shell out $8.95 for your very      own copy of <em>GROW IT!</em> That way, Richard Langer will      be happy, Saturday Review Press will be happy . . . and      we're betting that you'll be happy too. It's a darn good      book.    </p>    <p>      At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE Plan was      published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named Richard W.      Langer has come up with a 365-page book that really      introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna raise      your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain, chickens,      pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees? GROW IT! tells you how to      get started, we like it, and here's chapter two from the      book.    </p>    <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from      <em>GROW IT!</em><br />      Copyright Â© 1972 by Richard W. Langer.</p>	<h2 id="subtitle">CHAPTER TWO: tillage</h2>    <p>      <em>He that by the Plough would thrive,</em> <em><br />      himself must either hold or drive.</em><br />      -BENJAMIN FRANKLIN    </p>    <p>      All right, there you are with several acres of land in      front of your nose, and maybe, by your side, a tractor and      plow you decided were the proper things to have on a farm.      What do you do? Plow, of course. But how and where? Well,      first let's look at the equipment. Even if a neighbor comes      in to help plow and seed the fields the first couple of      years, you'll still need to know what the equipment is all      about. A farmer is willing to help and more than willing to      teach you, but he's not going to do the work while you sit      back in your rocker on the porch. Also you'll find it's      easier and less expensive than you think to get some of      your own equipment. You'll certainly want to do your own      plowing. After all, that's what farming's all about.    </p>    <p>      The simplest and cheapest tools to cultivate your land with      are a spading fork or shovel and a rake. You dig up the      soil and turn it over, trying to keep most of the topsoil,      which is darker, richer, and looser than the subsoil, just      where it was . . . on top. At the same time you are      breaking up the clods of earth and loosening the soil to      improve aeration. That's tillage, good old-fashioned,      primitive style. With this help roots can grow more easily,      and better roots mean better plants. In most cases, you'll      find that the topsoil is a layer six to twelve inches      thick. Very poor soil may have only a couple of inches      worth. Some fortunate California valleys have topsoil      thirty feet thick.    </p>    <p>      After the digging and clod-breaking, the ground should be      loose and crumbly. This, however, isn't enough. You'll be      planting tiny seeds or seedlings. The young early roots      need more help than that. Rake the soil back and forth      until all the particles to a two-inch depth are very small.      The surface layer, especially in the vegetable garden,      should have a particle size half that of a dime or less.      However, don't tamp down the ground perfectly smooth or      water penetration will be affected. Leave rake furrows on      the surface to aid drainage.    </p>    <p>      All this is fine for a small vegetable plot. But think of      it in terms of an acre, or even only half an acre, and just      the thought will leave you panting. There is a solution to      this backbreaking problem-albeit one that will      shatter your peaceful country silence for the      duration-a kind of small farmer's walking tractor or      horseless plow.    </p>    <h3>      EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      <em><strong>Rotary</strong></em>      <strong><em>Tiller</em></strong> . The rotary tiller is a      noisy but efficient little back-saver. This machine is      almost a must for a garden of any size. It is simple to      operate and easy to maintain. Usually it is no more than a      power lawn mower, except that instead of cutting grass, it      digs the soil for you. It will also dig in manure, both      green and barnyard, compost materials, lime, and what have      you.    </p>        <p>      Rotary tillers usually come with wheels mounted in front to      pull the digging blades, or wheels in back to keep the      machine steady. The front-puller models are easier and      smoother to operate, in fact no more difficult to manage      than a power mower. Those with rear-mounted wheels are less      expensive. For a real back-jolting thrill, try one of the      cheaper, older rotaries that don't use wheels at all, but      drag themselves along by the digging blades . . . you      balance them and steer the course. It's about like holding      onto the tail of a rampaging drunk kangaroo.    </p>    <p>      You'll find a rotary tiller cuts your gardening work to a      fraction of the time the shovel method takes . . . it still      isn't sufficient when you're considering a field of, say,      even five or six acres. What with waiting for the ground to      be plowable and still trying to get the seeds in as early      as possible to extend the growing season, you won't have      the spare month or two you might need to rotary till half a      dozen acres. You'll either have to trade labor with your      neighbor or get a tractor and plow. The latter alternative      is not as costly as you might think, simply because you      don't need the latest super-rig. One of the old,      semiabandoned tractors no longer economically viable for      the professional farmer will do you fine. You'll even find      that they are often cheaper than a new rotary tiller. A      farm auction is a good place to pick up old equipment      cheap.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Tractor.</strong></em> Tractors come in various      horsepower, but this isn't really a good way of telling      whether they will meet your needs. What you want is a      tractor that can draw a one- or two-bottom plow, that is, a      plow that turns one or two furrows at a time, respectively.      It will do fine no matter what its horsepower.    </p>    <p>      Don't fool around with garden tractors or the oversized      lawnmower variety. They'll only be a waste of time and      money. If you're going to get a tractor, go straight to the      real thing.    </p>    <p>      There are several pieces of auxiliary equipment you might      consider picking up to go with your tractor. Not all at      once, of course. But country auctions are a lot of fun, and      once you've been, you'll probably be hooked on them. Not      just for equipment, but comfy old furniture for your home,      and occasionally even livestock.    </p>    <p>      The first thing to remember in buying auxiliary equipment      is that whatever you get has to be compatible with your      tractor. If you have a small, older tractor capable of      pulling a onebottom plow, it's not going to do you any good      to get a five bottom plow unless you enjoy sitting with      your tractor and plow in the middle of a hot field with      your engine flat out, not going anywhere. Most equipment      will have a tractor hookup compatible with your tractor.      Note the <em>word</em> most . . . not all. Be sure to check      that whatever you get can in fact be hooked up without      major adjustments.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Plow.</strong></em> You may find your first      major tractor attachment, the plow, comes with the tractor.      This is because of the two major types, trailer plows and      mounted plows . . . the latter, as its name implies, comes      mounted on the tractor.    </p>    <p>      If they don't come as a combination, you'll probably have      to get a trailer plow. Chances are you won't be able to      find a mounted plow to fit. The trailer plow is preferred      anyhow . . . it does a better job. On the other side of the      coin, if you're tossing for it, a mounted plow is easier to      maneuver.    </p>    <p>      Trailer plows are of two varieties, the moldboard and the      disc. The disc plow is in Louis Bromfield's estimation just      about the greatest step forward in tilling since primitive      man first scratched furrows in the earth with a forked      stick. It has several huge steel wheels five feet or so in      diameter, all running on one axle, that literally chop up      the soil, digging deep for aeration and breaking all the      clods. It's particulary good for incorporating organic      matter far down into the soil when trash-mulching, that is      to say, burying field plants after harvesting by turning      the soil over on top of them. Working like one of the      old-fashioned spinach choppers of European kitchens, it      prepares the ground for planting in one coordinated      operation.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, as effective as they are, particularly on      heavy clay soils, you'll see few disc plows around. Unless      you're working with two, maybe three hundred acres or more,      they're just too big and expensive. Think of them as      thousand-acre rototillers.    </p>    <p>      This leaves you with the old traditional moldboard plow.      There's nothing wrong with a moldboard plow, however, as      long as you use it right and remember that plowing alone      won't be enough to get your soil in shape for planting.      You'll have to harrow the field as well.    </p>        <p>      The moldboard plow is the kind the urbanite expects to see      on the farm. It has a blade or blades like half a heart,      curved to dig into the soil, lift, and turn it over. At the      lower edge of the "bottom" is the point on which it rides,      and at the front of the moldboard is the share, which cuts      the soil. You will no doubt break a few points while you're      learning the ins and outs of using your plow. Cheer up.      They're replaceable. Each bottom makes a furrow, casting a      row of molded earth to one side. On the arm, or beam,      holding the bottom and in front of it is a coulter. This is      either a wheel or a mini-plowshare that precedes the plow      to open the sod. The coulter doesn't always have to be      lowered, but with heavy sod, or heavy mulch such as      cornstalks, plowing without it is impossible. The wheel      coulter is the preferred type since it won't snag      cornstalks or long-stemmed green manure.    </p>    <p>      With a one-bottom plow you'll make one furrow at a time,      with a two-bottom plow two at a time, and so on. Since a      two-bottom plow will cut the number of passes you have to      make up and down the field by 50 percent, it's well worth      getting if you can. But again, don't buy a bigger plow than      your tractor can handle.    </p>    <p>      Moldboard plows are divided into three general classes by      the shape of the moldboard: stubble, sod, and      general-purpose plows. The stubble plow has a short,      steeply pitched blade that breaks the soil into relatively      fine particles. However, it can only be used on land that      has been cultivated for some time. Try to use it on sod or      overgrown pasture land that has not been worked for      decades, and its sharply curved moldboard will dig in      rather than plow. You'll get nowhere. For the purpose of      breaking sod, the sod plow has a very long, narrower      moldboard with considerably less pitch. It won't pulverize      the soil as well as the stubble plow, but it will turn over      fields that could not be worked otherwise. Halfway between      these is the general-purpose plow, the one you'll most      likely use.    </p>    <p>      Chances are, since your neighbors will be working soil not      too different from yours, if you get your plow at a local      auction it will serve your purposes admirably. You may even      find one lying in back of your barn, but in that case be      prepared to do an awful lot of cleaning. You've heard of a      greased pig. Well, how about a greased plow? A plow blade      must be smooth and clean or the amount of energy needed to      pull it through the field increases immensely. Always clean      your moldboard after plowing. You don't have to dry it like      fine china, but if it's going to stand around without being      used for a while, it should be covered thoroughly with      grease to prevent rust.    </p>        <p>      Your neighbor might very well have an old plow around he'll      be more than happy to trade you for something. This is      about the best way to acquire it, since you'll need him to      show you how to plow. Don't be discouraged, it's a real art      when done right, and will take quite a bit of practice. But      then again, you wouldn't expect to be able to walk on your      hands the first time you tried it either. And the switch      from pushing a pencil in the city to working the soil in      the country is certainly no less radical a flip-flopping of      your world.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Harrow.</strong></em> If the plow is your      supersized spading fork, the harrow is your streamlined      rake. Harrows come in two main types, spring-tooth and      disc. You may have to settle for a spring-tooth harrow in      the beginning. But try to get a disc harrow if you can.      Although it is both more expensive and more finicky about      its maintenance, these drawbacks are more than compensated      for by its versatility. Where two passes with a disc harrow      might suffice for a good job on your field, using a      spring-tooth harrow you'll have to go over the same field      three or four times. And thick-stemmed crops such as corn      or sunflowers can be stubble-mulched directly into the      field again with the disc model after harvesting. That is      to say, all the stalks and stubble are worked right into      the soil by running the heavy disc harrow over the field a      couple of times. The discs cut up the stalks and bury them.      A spring-tooth harrow run over this kind of field would      simply jam up.    </p>    <p>      The spring-tooth harrow looks like four huge combs with      curved teeth, mounted one after the other, with a flexible      backbone. As you pull the harrow across the field, these      teeth break up the lumps of soil. Each tooth hits the soil,      is pulled back, and snaps forward with a vibrating chomp,      shattering the clump. The teeth all work together, a lot of      busy fingers crumbling the soil. On a disc harrow the      spring teeth have been replaced by discs that work the soil      and break up the plow lumps.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Broadcaster and Grain Drill.</strong></em> You      can sow most seeds by either broadcasting or drilling.      Broadcasting is simply scattering the seeds evenly over the      desired area. You fill up an old shoulder-strap bag and      then walk the fields, scooping out a handful of seeds and      flinging them from your hand in a wide arc. But the      simplicity of this age-old method is deceptive. It takes      quite a bit of practice, not only to sow the seeds evenly,      but to scatter the right number of them per acre.    </p>    <p>      To help you out, there's a simple and inexpensive device      that does your spacing for you, though you still have to do      the walking. It's a bag with a crank and spout. You hang it      over your shoulder and turn the crank as you stroll along .      . . a continuous stream of seeds is forced out the spout in      a fanlike pattern, to be buried by the elements. The      instructions accompanying the device will tell you how fast      to turn the crank and at what setting each size seed should      be sown. The broadcaster is sufficient equipment to take      care of several acres. If you have more than that to seed,      you'll want a grain drill.    </p>        <p>      A grain drill is also a reasonably simple machine and      relatively inexpensive if bought used. Basically it's just      a long horizontal hopper on wheels. Full of grain, it is      pulled behind the tractor, and leaves the seed in a nice      evenly distributed pattern known as drills. The seeds are      buried by the action of melodiously tinkling chains      dragging behind the grain drill. The drills here,      incidentally, have nothing to do with holes, as one might      imagine when thinking of a drilling machine . . . in this      case the term refers to the long rows in which the seeds      land. The grain drill has gears and openings that can both      be adjusted to sow the desired number of bushels per acre.      Usually you'll find the necessary information on proper      settings engraved on a small instruction plate near the      gears. When buying an old grain drill, be sure this plate      is still on the machine, or get someone familiar with the      model to show you what the different settings are.    </p>    <p>      If you get a grain drill, you'll also be able to use it to      sow corn, sunflowers, and other row crops. In this case,      however, you will have to stop up most of the holes,      leaving open only, enough to space out the rows properly.      If you want rows forty-eight inches apart, for instance,      then all the holes between those forty-eight inches apart      will have to be blocked. There's another use the grain      drill can be put to, with only one change of setting. You      can convert it into a lime spreader, providing your model      has a fertilizer hopper as well as a grain hopper. One with      just a grain hopper doesn't have enough capacity to make it      worthwhile.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Corn Planter.</strong></em> A grain drill      specifically for row crops has been designed, called a corn      planter. If you intend to plant several acres of, say, corn      or sunflowers, and you can find a single- or double-row      corn planter, it might be worth getting. But buy the grain      drill first. It's more versatile, being useful for sowing      your pasture and green manure crops as well as your grain,      not to mention liming. And, as noted, it can be used for      row crops with a bit of modification. A corn planter is      adjusted similarly to the grain drill to drop its seed at      so many bushels per acre in single rows from between a pair      of inclined discs that furrow the soil and cover the seed.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Manure Spreader.</strong></em> If your herd of      livestock ever increases to the point where you have      fifteen to twenty-five large animals of the pig or goat      size, a manure spreader will be worth your while. Old      manure spreaders never die, they just sit out back and      rust. Which is to your advantage. It might not have that      sparkling color you see in the farm machinery catalogs, but      an old rusted one in working condition won't cost you      anywhere near as much either. In its simplest form a manure      spreader is a wagon onto which you load the manure. As you      pull it across thefield, numerous steel fingers rotating on      a shaft which takes its power from the tractor or from its      own wheels fling the manure in an even pattern from the      wagon's tailgate.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Cultivator.</strong></em> Crops that are      broadcast, or drilled grain, will not need to be      cultivated. However, row crops, with large spaces between      the rows, will need some tending. Cultivation in the field      is what in the vegetable garden is called hoeing. That is      to say, the soil between the row crops is broken up to keep      it loose and friable, or crumbly. At the same time, weeds      are turned over and killed. The cultivator is mounted on      the tractor and does the job mechanically. In appearance      it's nothing but a series of small shovel-like blades      strung together on a frame. A rotary hoe works on the same      principle, wheel-mounted fingers doing the job.    </p>    <p>      Be prepared to cultivate part of your crop as well as the      spaces between it the first few times around, because until      you get the hang of it, you'll probably be digging up some      of your crop plants along with the weeds, particularly at      the ends of the field.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Mower.</strong></em> The mower is a giant      version of electric barber clippers. Parallel sharp teeth      slide back and forth, cutting anything that gets between      them. A mower is attached to the side of the tractor and      takes its power from the engine through a hookup. It cuts      your hay.    </p>    <p>      Grain binders used to be available for this purpose. They      both cut the grain and bind it ready for field-curing.      However, with the advent of the combine, which cuts and      threshes at the same time, grain binders have become      scarcer than the old proverbial hen's tooth.    </p>    <p>      To cut grain you'll either have to use a cradle scythe,      which will do fine on a couple of acres, or get a      neighboring farmer to run his combine over your field. If      you try to use your mower on grain, you'll find that the      grain heads will all shatter, leaving a well-sown field,      but no crop for flour.    </p>    <h3>      WORKING THE FIELDS    </h3>    <p>      Now obviously you won't get all your farm equipment at      once. You may not bother to get it at all if you're trading      work with your neighbor for help on your fields. But if      it's work you're trading, you'd best have a little      know-how, or it will do neither your fields nor your      neighbor's any good. How, then, does one go about "working      the land"?    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Clearing the Land.</strong></em> Let's start      with a field that has lain fallow for some time. The first      thing to do is walk it, checking for any enormous rocks or      bushes or saplings. Rocks don't grow the way trees do, but      they have an uncanny knack of making their way from the      subsoil to the surface. In an old field you may find them      there simply because the previous farmer knew exactly where      they lay and decided they were either impossible or too      much work to move. You may reach the same conclusion.    </p>    <p>      But you have to know their location in order not to break      your plow. Plows are strong. Still, they do break. And,      believe it or not, some fair-sized rocks honestly weren't      there the last time the field was plowed. They've surfaced      through frost-heaving, leaching, or other soil conditions.      These are usually fairly small and manageable. Harvest any      over the size of a cantaloupe.    </p>    <p>      Bushes or saplings that have established themselves in the      field must be cut down. Cut them as close to the ground as      you can, and always cut them flat across. A sharp,      spear-pointed sapling will go right through a tractor tire,      and changing tractor tires is no great joy. It's also an      unnecessary extra expense. Stumps from large saplings must      be pulled out. Then with the field cleared you're ready to      plow.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Plowing.</strong></em> The ground should not be      too wet or too dry the day you plow. If it's too wet, the      furrows will harden like rock pillars and the soil      granulation. will break down, reducing soil quality. If      it's too dry, you probably won't even get the plow in the      ground, and if you do manage to, the soil will break into      large clods while the plow skips around. The time for      plowing can be learned only by looking at and feeling the      soil. The old hands at it know when it's just right, so      plow when you see your neighbors revving up their tractors.    </p>    <p>      You start at the midpoint of one end of the field, not at      one side. A tractor will buck a lot compared to a car, and      your first task is to learn how to run it smoothly. Also,      southpaws please note, almost all plows are right-handed.      That is to say, the moldboard lifts the soil up and turns      it over to the right. As you run the tractor down the      center of a field, the trick is to get the plow to dig in      consistently at the same level, usually about five to eight      inches deep.    </p>        <p>      Standard plowing practice calls for turning the soil over      completely. That's the way it's still done in most areas.      However, the major criticism against moldboard      plowing-and it's been a controversial subject ever      since E.H. Faulkner's classic Plowman's Folly was published      in 1943-is that by completely burying the surface      trash, the organic material is blocked off from its oxygen      supply and thus does not break down in a way most      beneficial to the soil.    </p>    <p>      Disc plowing avoids the problem, chopping up the trash and      only half burying it. But since the disc plow is simply not      a practical investment for the small farm, what can you do?      The answer is, plow so the furrow is but half turned. This      will bring up the subsoil, at the same time only partly      submerging the trash. With cornstalks and sod you will have      to turn the soil over all the way, however, unless you have      a disc harrow to chop them up before plowing. The trash,      contrary to its name, is essential to your soil.    </p>    <p>      Turning your furrows half over may pose something of a      social dilemma if your neighbors invert their furrows      completely. The best way to lose your neighbors' help is to      tell them how to plow their fields, at least your first      year. Wait. Learn to plow their way. Then, some other year,      figure out how to adjust the moldboard so it doesn't      completely turn the furrow. Chances are for the first      couple of years you won't be able to turn a furrow properly      anyhow. This isn't to discourage you, it's simply a fact.      You wouldn't try, say, flying without lessons, so it      shouldn't come as a surprise that you'll have to learn how      to plow . . . on the other hand, when you make a mistake on      the field it might decrease your yield a little, but you      won't end up splattered all over the countryside.    </p>    <p>      All right, there you are running down the center of your      field, trying to keep the furrow straight and the plow set      properly at the same time. Suddenly you're at the other end      of the field. You stop. If you plow all the way to the end,      how do you turn around? If you. don't, what happens to all      those irregular arches you've plowed into the field while      trying to turn on it?    </p>    <p>      For the purpose of plowing, fields are customarily divided      into two distinct sections, the lands and the headlands.      The headlands are strips about fifteen feet wide at either      end of the field which you leave unplowed as turn-around      areas. The lands are what you plow first.    </p>    <p>      The reason "lands" is plural is that a very wide field is      broken up into separate plow areas. A field up to a hundred      and fifty yards wide you can treat as one land. If it's      three hundred yards, divide it into two separate lands and      plow each as an individual field. This is so you don't      spend too much time going back and forth across the      headlands.    </p>    <p>      So you've plowed one furrow and managed to turn around.      Which side of the furrow do you go down? If you go down the      right-hand side-remember, a plow is      right-handed-you'll be scooping more soil away from      the first furrow, leaving a deep trench down the field.      Since you're not trying to build trenches but plow a field,      how about going down the left-hand side? But then you'd be      piling soil up against the first furrow and you'd end up      with a ridge down the center of the field. You really don't      want a ridge either.    </p>    <p>      Not all problems have a solution. In this case, you opt for      the ridge. Every land has one down the center, and since      it's the backbone of the field, at least visually, it has      acquired the name "back furrow."    </p>    <p>      After you've gone over the field twice and formed the back      furrow, you always keep left of the previous furrow. In      other words, you're plowing up the field, crossing the      headland, and plowing down to the other headland in an      ever-widening parallelogram.    </p>    <p>      When you've finished plowing one land, if your field is big      you go on to the next land. Note that it is the width of      the field that determines the number of lands, not the      length. The length doesn't matter. In fact, the longer the      better . . . it saves time. The purpose of lands is simply      to avoid spending too much time crossing the headlands      again and again.    </p>    <p>      If you have more than one land, you'll end up with the      ditch between them that would have been down the center of      the field instead of the back furrow had you made a right      turn instead of a left one when you first started. It can't      be helped. This ditch is known as the dead furrow. The big      difference you've made by turning right while plowing is      that you end up with a dead furrow only between the. lands.      If you plowed a whole field making left turns, you'd end up      with nothing but dead furrows. Remember, the plow is always      a righty.<br />    </p>    <p>      Once the land or lands are plowed, you go across the      headlands, making furrows at right angles to those of the      lands. Then sit back and let the field dry for a few days.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Liming.</strong></em> If you're going to lime      your field, after the field has dried a bit is the time to      do it. Fill the grain drill with lime, set the adjustment      for liming, and run up and down the field, starting one      spreader's width away from one side and working your way      over to within a spreader's width of the other. Then sweep      once around the edges of the field. (See diagram below.)    </p>        <p>      <em><strong>Harrowing.</strong></em> So you've plowed the      land. There are now lumpy furrows running up and down your      field, maybe tousled a bit more from working lime into      them. Looking at those furrows, you decide that a seed only      an eighth of an inch or so in size will get totally lost.      Right you are. To prepare the field for seeding, you will      have to harrow it. That is to say, you want it to be level      and smooth again, with all the lumps broken up.    </p>    <p>      If you're beginning to wonder why you should plow at all      and then return the land to its preplowed state, well,      that's not actually what you're doing. The soil will have      been turned and broken up. Any organic matter will have      been worked in, and what you end up with is a deep layer of      loose, well-aerated earth. Don't plow, and you'll have an      asphalt-hard field.    </p>    <p>      The harrowing pattern is more complex than that for      plowing. You'll be covering the same ground over and over      again, and your first time around can indeed be a harrowing      experience. First you run the harrow over the field the      same way you plowed. This levels it a bit. Then, starting      at an oblique angle to the edge of the field, you use a      harrowing pattern, rather like drawing a series of      superimposed squares and oblongs in simultaneously      increasing and decreasing sizes without lifting the pencil.      See the following diagram. As if that isn't enough, it's      about as dusty as the Sahara in a sandstorm. If you've      always wondered why so many farmers chewed tobaccy, it      keeps that old spittle washing grit from between the teeth.    </p>        <p>      The harrowing pattern permits you to run the field      continuously, and it cross-harrows the field so the clods      of earth are attacked from different directions. Then you      give it a final once-over at right angles to the direction      in which the field was plowed and will be sown. This angle      leaves the ground patterned so that when you sow you can      see your tracks across it and know what ground you've      covered and what you haven't.    </p>    <p>      <em>Sowing.</em> Unless you're broadcasting, load up the      old grain drill with the seed you want and set the gears      and holes for the appropriate number of bushels per acre.      The sowing pattern is the same as that for liming. The      trick is to run over the field once without overlapping      seeded areas or leaving empty spaces. Don't worry, you'll      do a passable, if not exactly professional, job the first      time if you're careful and go slowly. If you err, it's      better to err on the side of overlapping than leaving      future bald spots. The second time you sow, your spread      might be acceptable, the third, even good. The only way to      get the hang of it is with practice, so don't fret over      your mistakes.    </p>    <h3>      TILLAGE MANAGEMENT    </h3>    <p>      There area few long-range factors to take into account when      planning how to work your land. Knowing the lay of your      land and mapping out your fields for their best use make      good land management. Contour plowing, strip farming, and      crop rotation are the three major principles to keep in      mind.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Contour Plowing.</strong></em> Given a hillside      to plow, the natural instinct is to go up and down. It's      easier to work that way. It's also very destructive. Water      at the top of a hill after a rain finds it easier to run      straight down the hill too. And so it does. It joins the      water that fell a little farther down the hill, and that a      little farther still. Halfway down the hill it really      begins to pick up momentum and volume. By the time it      reaches the bottom of the field, you have parallel torrents      running in rivers down each furrow. You lose not only      moisture needed by the soil, but the soil itself, for the      rushing water erodes the topsoil. Much valuable land was      destroyed by runoff before the concept of contour plowing      became popular.    </p>    <p>      In contour planting, furrows in hillsides are made with the      contour of the land. It takes considerable planning to make      each furrow level, but this eliminates erosion. Water seeps      into the ground instead of sliding down it, and the topsoil      stays where it belongs-on your field.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Strip Farming.</strong></em> An added boost to      contour farming, where space permits, is to grow bands of      different crops. The bands may vary in width, depending on      the size of the field . . . for convenience, they're often      the width of one land. This practice is known as strip      farming because of the ribbon 'pattern that develops.    </p>    <p>      Strip farming is something you won't try right away,      perhaps, but knowing about it makes good sense because the      underlying principle is part and parcel of effective land      management. While you plow and work strips for one crop,      the intermediate bands, already sown for cover or bearing      other crops, are left alone. These lands are then worked      once the others have begun to take care of themselves.      Sowing the intervening strips alternately to a cover crop      that will, be plowed under as green manure helps build up      the organic quality of the soil.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Crop Rotation.</strong></em> Crop rotation      brings to mind the by now almost trite maxim that you      shouldn't plant land to the same crop over and over again      because it will exhaust the soil. This is true, but it's      not the whole truth about the benefits of crop rotation.      Rotation plays a much more positive role than that. It      improves farmland, not merely gives it a rest, and more      importantly, it is one of the basic ways of controlling      insects and weeds without dangerous chemicals.    </p>    <p>      Insects are for the most part useful creatures, and in many      cases essential ones. Even those few considered simply      pests in all probability serve some as yet unrecognized      positive purpose. The whole insect problem has arisen      chiefly because of crop concentration.    </p>    <p>      In nature a wild cornstalk might have been found growing      every thirty or forty feet as part of a mixed meadow. Man      has taken the plant and raised it in rows to the exclusion      of everything else in that field. In the wild state an      insect destructive to corn would find a plant, eat its      fill, breed, and die. Most of the offspring would starve to      death before maturity, simply because the next corn plant      was too far away to find. Even if they found it, one more      plant wasn't enough to feed them all. The same held true      for diseases . . . with limited plant density, their spread      was much less rapid.    </p>    <p>      But with a wealth of corn within munching distance, as it      is under cultivation, living is easy for the bugs. Not only      can all the offspring thrive, but their offspring in turn      flourish. The old population explosion does its bit. Soon      crops are eaten before they can mature, much less be      harvested.    </p>    <p>      However, insects are neighborhood-oriented. Grow corn in      one place the first year and on another field the next, and      most of the insects won't relocate with the crop. A large      part of your pest problem is solved by the simple procedure      of crop rotation. The same holds true for weeds, some of      which will thrive with one crop and be practically      incompatible with another.    </p>    <p>      The other major benefit of crop rotation is that it builds      up the soil. By alternating plants that use large      quantities of nitrogen-corn, for instance-with      those such as the legumes that actually add nitrogen to the      soil, a productive balance is achieved. The same holds true      for growing a green manure crop that is plowed under as      part of the rotation scheme. It will build up the organic      material in the soil, often at no loss of a crop, since      your land should never lie bare. Planting a cover crop of,      say, rye, for the winter not only protects the land from      erosion, but also builds it up even further in spring when      it is plowed under in preparation to sowing your cash crop.    </p>    <p>      A basic crop rotation scheme would have five equal-sized      fields planted to four different crops at the same time.      Five equals four because one crop-usually      alfalfa-is grown on two fields at the same time.      Let's say you want to grow wheat for your bread, oats for      livestock feed and bedding, alfalfa for hay, and corn for      the chickens. Now obviously, since you're using fields the      same size, you'll have more wheat than you can use. But      don't decide to cut down on the wheat crop. One of the      basic rules of crop rotation is always to use the fields as      laid out by the boundaries of the previous crop. If you      have too much wheat, trade some, sell some, or use it as      livestock feed.    </p>        <p>      The following year you simply play musical fields. Each      crop moves one field to the left, except the alfalfa, a      good stand of which will last at least two years. The same      goes for the third, fourth, and fifth years. By the sixth      your corn will once more be growing where it was the first      year.    </p>    <p>      The fundamentals of crop rotation can be listed quite      simply, as follows:    </p>    <p>      1. The area for each crop should be about the same and the      demarcation of the fields should remain constant over the      years.<br />      2. The whole cycle should contain at least one legume, one      deep-rooted crop such as alfalfa, and one sod-building      crop.<br />      3. When possible, have one extra field in your rotation, or      on the sidelines, so to speak. Keep this field in a pasture      crop for two to four years, then reenter it into rotation      with the grain crop. The field most recently used for the      grain crop is then given over to the pasture crop for the      same number of years.<br />      4. By using one field for pasture, rather than cutting all      the forage and hauling it to the barn, manure will be      delivered directly to the field by the grazing livestock.      This will assure maximum utilization of the manure,      particularly the urine.    </p>    <p>      Strip farming and contour plowing may not be necessary on      your field. Crop rotation always is. And although the lay      of your land might not permit you to follow the above plan      exactly, the closer you come to the ideal, the better your      re sults. Sit down and plan your crops before you plow and      plant.    </p>
