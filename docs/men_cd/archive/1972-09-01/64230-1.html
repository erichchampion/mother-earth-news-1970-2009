        LEFT: ""Jack"" Hayseed has a face made of cherry tomatoes stuck on with pins. Pumpkins mean autumn fun and we like to see how many novel faces we can come up with. Such decorations add noticeably to roadside sales of the plump fruit too! ABOVE: Medium to medium-large pumpkins sell best for Jack-O-Lantern use. Big Max, Connecticut Field and Tricky Jack (which grows on a compact bush instead of rangy vines) are all good. Monster pumpkins, grown by nipping off all but three or four fruit from each regularly fertilized Big Max vine, are easy to sell for store window displays.
