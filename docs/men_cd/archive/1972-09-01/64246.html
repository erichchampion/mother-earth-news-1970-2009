    <p>
                        <p>      Most people are not aware of the great increase in electric      power consumption that has occurred in the last 10 or 20      years and which is now leading to energy shortages and      environmental disaster. The trend in power consumption is      ever upward and fuel combustion, generating plants and      utility lines increasingly mar the landscape in even remote      and otherwise unspoiled parts of our land. We must curtail      our energy consumption first, then turn to alternate      sources of power-such as the wind-if we want to      live in tune with nature on this planet.    </p>    <p>      Before considering the wind as a source of power for your      domestic needs, however, you should take a look at the      electrical appliances you now have and decide which you      consider essential and which are just conveniences. Wind      power can be useful, but a very large and expensive      windmill would be needed to operate such greedy consumers      of electric energy as clothes dryers, space heaters, hot      water heaters, electric ranges and large, color TV sets.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, you can live with reasonably modest      lighting, radios, shavers, a small black and white TV, a      refrigerator and perhaps an oil burner motor and circulator      . . . you may find that the wind can supply all or part of      your electric energy needs.    </p>    <p>      Let me, however, point out some aspects of wind power that      must be taken into account before embarking on any such      home energy generation project. First and most obvious is      the intermittent nature of this resource. Wind power is      extracted from the kinetic energy of moving air and the      power available from any mill at any given time is      proportional to the cube of the wind velocity. Which is to      say that if you can get, for example, 160 watts from a mill      at a wind speed of 10 mph . . . then you can obtain 1,280      watts when the air velocity is 20 mph (if the generator has      the capability), but only 20 watts at a wind speed of 5      mph.    </p>    <p>      Remember too that-depending on your      location-you may find there are long intervals during      which the wind will be relatively calm. If this is so, your      wind generator will not put out any appreciable power for      long periods, during which you'll have to resort either to      energy stored in batteries, or to a standby gasoline or      diesel-driven generator. If you are fortunate in having a      windy site, this will be less of a problem . . . but it      cannot be overlooked.    </p>        <p>      Another aspect to be considered is that of excessive winds,      such as a severe storm, hurricane or tornado. Provision      must be made for feathering the mills' blades, tilting the      attitude of the propeller so that the wind hits the ends      and edges of the fan instead of the airfoil surfaces or      applying some kind of brake or aerodynamic spoiler.      Automatic as well as manual operation of such a device is      desirable.    </p>    <p>      The intermittent nature of wind as an energy source makes      it most useful for those applications where the effect or      result is easily stored. Pumping water for irrigation or      domestic use with power extracted from moving air is a      natural. Windmills have been used for this purpose in the      Low Countries for many centuries, and were commonly      harnessed for the same work on this continent only a few      decades ago.- Today such American farm windmills (Figure 1)      are found mostly in Amish areas. Elsewhere the machines are      often seen in a state of disrepair on abandoned or unused      homesteads.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in pumping water with wind power you      may be able to find an old American farm windmill and      refurbish it with new vanes and mechanical parts. Or you      can purchase one brand new, as they're still made in a      variety of sizes from 6 to 16 ft. in diameter, mounted on      steel towers as high as 80 ft. tall, by the Aeromotor      Company of Broken Arrow, Oklahoma 74012. The manufacturer      gives performance in terms of pumping rate ranging from 100      to 3,000 gallons per hour. Construction is sturdy,      self-lubricating, and the designs are dependable through      many decades of experience in production and usage.      Dempster Industries of Beatrice, Nebraska 68310 and the      Heller-Aller Company, Napoleon, Ohio 43545 are two other      sources for these water pumping windmills.    </p>        <p>      The most comprehensive description of a home-built windmill      is contained in a report prepared for an organization      called Volunteers for International Technical Assistance      (College Campus, Schenectady, New York 12308) by a Dr.      Bossel of the University of California (see Reference 2).      The paper describes a 16-blade mill with a diameter of 4      meters (13 ft.). The machine employs an automobile rear      axle and differential as both the shaft and support for the      fan . . . and the means for transmitting the mechanical      energy to the bottom of the tower.    </p>    <p>      Detailed descriptions of sheet metal blade construction and      regulating mechanism are given in Bossel's report and the      only tool required which may not be readily available to      most MOTHER readers is welding equipment. Any body and      fender shop or blacksmith (check the yellow pages) should      have both the necessary equipment and skill, however,      or-in lieu of welding-other fastening methods      such as screws & nuts or rivets can be used.    </p>    <p>      This mill is primarily intended for pumping water and doing      other mechanical duties rather than for generating electric      power. Its tower and elevated turntable platform (see      Figure 4) are of wooden construction. The machine's output      in a 10 mph breeze is 1/3 horsepower, it produces 1 hp in a      wind of 15 mph and over 2-1/2 hp when spun by air moving 20      mph.    </p>    <p>      But what about electric power generation? Such energy is      not easily stored (a bank of automotive-type storage      batteries may supply a few hours' needs . . . but then      you're either out of power or you crank up a      gasoline-driven generator). I would strongly recommend such      a gasoline-powered standby unit for any winddriven      generator if you want reliable power without tying into the      utility line. At some future date, perhaps, the fuel cell      will serve as the alternate source, thereby avoiding the      noise and pollution problems of the internal combustion      engine.    </p>        <p>      There is a wind-powered generator called the      <em>Wincharger</em> available for about $400 from      Dyna-Technology, Inc. of Sioux City, Iowa 51102. It uses a      6-ft. two-bladed propeller with a patented air-brake      governor to limit its speed in high winds, and comes with a      10-ft. steel tower. Although of small capacity (it produces      20 to 30 kilowatt-hrs. of energy per month and charges a      12-volt battery at rates up to 14 amperes) the unit is very      reliable and has been produced for many years. A 7 mph      breeze is sufficient to start charging, and full output is      reached in a 23 mph wind. For a cabin, campsite, trailer,      camper or boat the Wincharger would be adequate to serve      the electrical needs of 12-volt lighting, radio, shaver and      portable TV.    </p>    <p>      It should be noted that when 120-volt AC appliances are to      be accommodated, an electrical device called an inverter      must be used to convert a wind generator's 12-volt DC to      the higher AC current. The size and cost of this stationary      converter depends on the maximum wattage of the various      loads which may be connected at any time and there is a      certain loss of power in the inverter (typical efficiency      being 80 to 90%).    </p>    <p>      If you're looking for a windmill which will serve needs up      to a few kilowatts, you must consider larger machines. One      source for them is Elektro gmbH of Winterthur, Switzerland.      This manufacturer's units employ three-bladed propellers      ranging from 3.5 to 5.0 meters in diameter with output      ratings from 2,000 to 5,000 watts. The equipment produces      110-volt DC current and, as usual, is employed in      conjunction with a bank of storage batteries.    </p>    <p>      The Elektro units are of sophisticated design with blades      which may be adjusted or "feathered" to compensate for      varying wind speeds. The propeller shaft is coupled to the      generator by gears running in an oil bath. As might be      expected, the price of these machines runs to several      thousand dollars, but-if you add up all your electric      bills over a few years-that's not so unreasonable.    </p>    <p>      And what about building your own wind-driven electric      generator? Well I'd advise that you first arm yourself with      all the information you can get and ask yourself if your      site is suitable. You might even record daily air      velocities at your location with an inexpensive wind gauge      (F.W. Dwyer of Michigan City, Indiana 46360, sells a small      hand-held wind meter for about $9).    </p>    <p>      Figure that the mill should be situated at a higher level      than any obstructions nearer than a few hundred feet. This      may require a high tower, or running a line out to a      hilltop location. Remember that the power you'll get is      strongly dependent on average air speed, so make sure you      pick the spot most exposed to prevailing winds.    </p>    <p>      Next, decide on the approximate-sized machine you need or      can readily build, bearing in mind that power output varies      as the square of propeller diameter (a 6-ft. diameter      propeller yields four times as much power as one of the      same design but only 3 ft. across). Construction costs also      go up sharply with increased size. With 3 ft. or less, all      you can expect to do is trickle charge batteries or carry      very small loads such as a single radio or small light.      Then again, building and operating a generator of this size      might be worthwhile before undertaking a larger unit.    </p>    <p>      You'll find a 6-ft. diameter mill to be a good practical      size if you can really limit your consumption of      electricity. Even more useful is a 10 or 12-ft. diameter      power plant unless you find the difficulty and costs of      construction prohibitive. I would not recommend fabrication      of any larger units until some experience is gained with      one of these smaller sizes.    </p>        <p>      Choice of propeller style and design has a strong bearing      on the efficiency of a windmill. All modern electric      generating mills have two or three very slender blades      resembling aircraft propellers (see Figures 2 and 3). Such      designs feature a high rip <em>speed ratio</em> which is a      comparison between the velocity of the blade tips and the      wind speed. Tip speed ratios between 5 and 8 are not      uncommon for efficient high-speed mills . . . as compared      to the ratios between 1 and 3 which are typical for the      slower-running multiblade machines such as the American      farm water-pumping windmill. On the other hand, although      the latter design is less efficient, its higher starting      torque and better performance at low wind velocities gives      it a steadier pumping action in light breezes.    </p>    <p>      Ideally, the propeller of a wind machine used for      generating electricity should have a cross-section      resembling that of an aircraft wing . . . with a thick,      rounded leading edge tapering down to a sharp trailing      edge. It should be noted, however, that the most efficient      airfoils for aircraft propellers, helicopter blades or      contoured fan blades (all designed to move air) are not the      most efficient airfoils for windmills (which are intended      to be <em>moved by</em> air). An old airplane propeller, in      other words, has neither the proper contour nor angle of      attack to satisfactorily extract energy from the wind. If      you have the ability and time to devote to carving a      propeller from wood, however, you'll find good windcharger      designs to copy in Reference 1.    </p>        <p>      The generator itself is of vital importance in any      windelectric system. Unfortunately, most generators which      would seem to be suitable suffer from the requirement that      they be driven at high speeds (most are built to be turned      by gasoline engines at 1,500 to 3,600 rpm) and windmills,      especially in larger sizes, seldom exceed 300 rpm. This      means that one must either find special generators, or      resort to step-up gearing to achieve the high rotational      speed needed by the generator. Brushless permanent-magnet      rotor alternators give reliable, troublefree operation and      require no electric power for a field winding but;      unfortunately, are hard to come by. One possibility is to      adapt an automobile alternator by replacing the field      winding in the rotor with a permanent magnet.    </p>    <p>      On a much smaller scale, there is available at reasonable      cost (about $11) a bicycle generator which will produce a      useful output of one to two watts at low rotational speeds.      This is the English-made Sturmey-Archer <em>Dynohub</em>      generator, sold in this country by Raleigh of America, 350      Secaucus, Secaucus, New Jersey 07094. With a 2-ft. diameter      propeller it can deliver its rated output without any      modification. All that's required is the attachment of      propeller blades.    </p>    <p>      Figure 5 illustrates one unit constructed by the author.      For charging a 6-volt automotive battery, a bridge      rectifier such as the VARO W111, available from Allied      Electronics, or the Motorola MDA 920-2 is used as shown in      Figure 6. Either costs about $1.50.    </p>        <p>      The propeller on the model shown in Figure 5 is the modular      construction "Multi-Wing" fan made in Denmark, and sold in      the US by ILG Industries. In many respects the design is      far from ideal as it is somewhat heavy, expensive and its      minimum pitch angle of 30° results in a rather low      tip-speed ratio. The Danish fan, however, is rugged,      weatherproof, durable and develops plenty of      torque-even in a moderate breeze-to overcome      the slight cogging effet in the Dynohub generator.    </p>    <p>      The Dynohub unit is made for use as the hub of a bicycle      front wheel and comes equipped with ball bearings and spoke      holes . . . which make it possible to construct sheet      aluminum or fiberglass blades and secure them to the hub at      two points. At the perimeter a bicycle rim can serve as the      supporting ring. The Dynohub is available in two models,      with holes to accommodate either a 32 or a 36-spoke wheel.      One model is suited to 4 or 8-bladed fan and the other to a      3 or 9-bladed propeller.    </p>    <p>      Practical applications of this design are limited to      trickle charging batteries, such as for a boat at a      mooring, or for a two-way radio at a remote campsite or      cabin.    </p>    <p>      Inspiration for my Dynohub mill came from a wind-powered      generator developed about 1964 by the National Bureau of      Standards for use by the Navy or Weather Bureau on the      MAMOS automatic weather reporting station. The      <em>Tri-GEN</em> wind power units (Figure 7) which supply      power to this buoy, use three modified Dynohub generators      on the shaft of the windmill to produce a threephase output      and reduce cogging effect. Both 30" and 36" 20-bladed mills      are used to reach peak outputs close to 7 watts at wind      velocities between 23 and 25 knots. Their low tip-speed      ratio of 1.7 is typical of mutibladed mills. The propeller      blades are fabricated of sheet aluminum and are supported      at their tips by a double ring and at half-span by a      smaller ring.    </p>    <p>      The table below gives the theoretical power available from      reasonably high-performance (70% efficient) mills such as      those having two slender blades with a high tip-speed      ratio.    </p>        <p>      Windmill Power Output in Watts    </p>    <p>      The above figures are based on a formula given in the      six-page section<br />      on wind power in Marks' <em>MECHANICAL ENGINEERS      HANDBOOK.</em>    </p>    <p>      The design of a windmill involves decisions as to the size      of the generator as well as the size and style of the      propeller or rotor. Since there are no fuel costs, the cost      of construction and maintenance are prime considerations      and it's best to start with an electric generator of      adequate power rating at relatively low speeds (a few      hundred rpm).    </p>    <p>      Once a suitable machine is selected, a decision must be      made as to what wind velocity will be necessary to achieve      full output of the generator. If you decide to get full      electric output at low wind speeds, you'll need a larger      propeller . . . whereas a small fan will be adequate if you      want full electric output only in very high winds. The      question to ask when designing a mill, then, is: how      frequently do winds blow with a velocity greater than X      mph?    </p>    <p>      Statistical studies made of wind records at Dayton, Ohio      show that each month there is a well-defined group of wind      velocities which predominate. These are called the      <em>prevalent,</em> or frequent winds. There is also a      well-defined group which contains the bulk of the energy      each month called, appropriately enough, <em>energy      winds.</em> Energy winds blow 2 out of 7 days; prevalent      winds 5 out of 7.    </p>    <p>      Many working wind machines are designed to reach full      output in air velocities of 20 to 25 mph, and deliver no      appreciable output in breezes of less than 6 or 8 mph. At      winds higher than those required for maximum output,      governors or spoilers limit the rpm of the mill, thereby      throwing away large quantities of energy but protecting the      machine against damage. Lack of good performance at low      wind velocities is not a serious drawback, since there is      very little energy available from the wind at these calm      conditions anyway.    </p>    <p>      Here are some average wind velocities at various locations:    </p>		    <p>      It should be noted that wind velocity will vary      considerably even in a local area, as the figures for New      York City indicate. At any rate, figures and tables aside,      nature has free power available for you to use, without      polluting Mother Earth or consuming her resources. Think      about harnessing the wind and give it a try . . . you'll      like it!    </p>    <h3>      BIBLIOGRAPHY:    </h3>    <p>      <em>1.
