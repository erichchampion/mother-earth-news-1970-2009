                    <h5 id="byline">      by Jan Adkins    </h5>            <p>      <strong>a</strong> <strong>SERIOUS FISHERMAN</strong>      gathers food for market and for his table. He is neither an      idle angler nor a blood sportsman, but a practical man      bartering skill for food. There are few hard rules in      fishing; techniques change with the days of the season,      with currents and water temperature. There are some      generalities, however, that can serve if local knowledge      and current usage support them.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BOTTOM FISHING</strong> <strong><em>flounder,      fluke, cod, tautog.<br /></em></strong> drifting free or      slowed by a small anchor (a "lunch hook"), the bottom      fisher drops a weight and single hook , or a gang rig with      treble hooks, and baits it with clams or sea worms.    </p>        <p>      jigging is a technique used by fishermen who know where the      schools are the bright treble hooks ad weight are jerked up      and down, attracting fish and foul-hooking as many fish as      are fair-hooked<br />      <strong>JIGGING</strong> <strong><em>cod, haddok,      halibut</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>CASTING</strong> <em><strong>bass,      bluefish<br /></strong></em> from a distance, the spasmodic      jerking of the plug caster is unmistakeable. He wades or      motors to the schools with a spinning or casting rig and an      array of lures that look as if no self-respecting fish      would touch them.    </p>        <p>      <strong>TROLLING</strong> <strong><em>bass, bluefish, tuna,      marlin, swordfish<br /></em></strong> fishermen troll for      fish big and vicious enough to attack a good-size lure      (surgical tubes, buck-tails, rag-maps or whatever the fish      are admiring) moving through the water at 3 or 4 knots.      they glass the horizon for gulls working schools of      baitfish driven flashing to the surface by circling packs      of predators.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SMALLER FISH</strong> are of little market value,      but sport fish and larger fish-blues, bass, halibut,      haddock, swordfish-have a definite value at the fish      house if they are handled well. they should be gutted      quickly-especially haddock and cod-and iced      down in fish boxes or kept in iced brine.    </p>
