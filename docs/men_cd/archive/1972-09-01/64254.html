        <p>None of the authors of the articles on pickup trucks (MOTHER NO. 12) mentioned the foolproof way of determining whether there's water in the oil . . . run the engine till it reaches normal operating temperature, withdraw the dip stick and let the oil drip on the exhaust manifold. If the oil bubbles, there's water in it.</p><p>Tom Wilson<br />Colorado Springs, Colo.</p><p>I've just read Doyce Purcell's article on buying a used pickup, and some of my experience with posi-traction doesn't agree with his. On a road that's at a right angle to the slope of the hill, positraction will cause a vehicle to point uphill under slippery conditions. Sometimes this can be corrected with the accelerator, but twice I was unable to continue on a road since my vehicle would only point uphill. The first time this happened was on a paved but ice-coated highway, and the other time on a dirt, snow-covered mountain road. Others have told me of similar experiences.</p><p>I'd look for a truck without posi-traction.</p><p>Robert J. Thullen<br />Shafter, Calif.</p><p>Some comments on the pickup truck articles in MOTHER NO. 12:</p><p>First off, VW's aren't the best for heavy loads . . . too much of a strain on the engine. Datsun is too small for much, but the Peugeot 403 station wagon should make a good truck . . . leaf springs front and back, 1,700 pounds capacity (that's more than my 3/4 ton GMC van has). It's an easy car to work on and a good buy if parts can be had. Up here in the Northeast, parts are becoming available for foreign cars, so they're not the problem they used to be (still are, in some places).</p><p>Corvairs are generally a waste . . . the older ones tend to spew oil out the back and have nasty clutch problems.</p><p>Early Chevy trucks can be very hard-shifting, maybe due to a problem with the linkage on the steering column (Whitney's used to have a cheap fix for the trouble . . . otherwise you have to live with it or replace the whole column).</p><p>If you need power and can't get a four-speed transmission with a two-speed rear end, a V-8 will satisfy you . . . at the cost of gas consumption (most V-8 truck mileage is low . . . 10 mpg is the median).</p><p>A four-wheel-drive truck is usually great, but check it thoroughly before buying and if it's been used to push a plow, be careful. Such work wears the front ball-joints, makes the front wheels wobble, burns out clutches like mad and is rough on the transmission. In general, four-wheel-drive trucks aren't really designed for the kind of abuse to which they're often subjected.</p><p>When buying any older truck, check the oil pressure with a MECHANICAL gauge. Start the test with the engine cold and note the pressure. If, when the engine gets hot and the oil thins out, the pressure drops more than 10 psi, listen for a heavy, very rapid rattle . . . that means trouble.</p><p>Good tires aren't necessarily new tires. Retreads are fine for most work and are as strong as new ones (get them from someone who specializes in truck recaps). They're not so good for the highway, though, since the heat build-up causes the tread bonding to break down (very nasty).</p><p>If you're using a truck off the road and hard, it's probably best to change the oil often (I use European specs and change the oil every 1,500 miles, the filter every 6,000 . . . both more often off the road). Use good oil, <em>not</em> reclaimed.</p><p>If you don't know anything about maintenance, the <em>AUDEL AUTOMOBILE GUIDE</em> is good for basic explanations . . . then use the motor manuals for details. The best buys in tools are from U.S. General Supply, 100 General Place, Jericho, N.Y. 11753 . . . 40% off list prices and really good buys on all kinds of tools. The catalog costs $1, refunded on the first order.</p><p>Maddog<br />Massachusetts</p><p>When I first got my pickup truck, every bump felt like a chuckhole. 1 solved the problem by building two wooden boxes, putting a plastic bag of sand in each and placing one on either side between the wheel well and the tailgsate. A hundred pounds of coarse sand not only smooths the ride but also helps traction when you get stuck.</p><p>I find that a piece of emery cloth will give dry cells a longer life . . . poor contact between cells is resistance and resistance uses up current. I just rub the poles of the cells with the cloth and then the current can flow easier.</p><p>Robert Stewart<br />Denver, Colo.</p>
