        Election Day is this Tuesday, Nov. 7 ? it's time to make your voiceheard. And your vote matters more now than ever before. Every statewill have ballots, covering everything from local propositions tofederal representation. This year, voters get to send a clearmessage to Congress: 33 Senate seats are up for re-election andeach of the 435 representatives in the House will either keep hisor her job, or have to clear out for someone new. So, don't thinkfor a second that your vote doesn't matter or isn't worth the time? this election could bring about sweeping change and set a newtone for the direction of our country.<br /><br />From the Iraq war to the economy to political corruption, a handfulof front-and-center issues will be on voters' minds. But just asrelevant are looming energy and environmental issues, such asglobal warming, unstable gas prices and our addiction to oil. Theleaders we elect now will either keep us going on the same courseor implement real solutions.<br /><br />The good news is it's easy to make sure your vote goes to those whowill support sustainable, alternative energy (such as wind andsolar) and action to curb greenhouse gases. <br /><br />The best resource comes from the nonprofit<a href="http://www.lcv.org/" target="_blank">League ofConservation Voters</a> (LCV), which maintains its<a href="http://www.lcv.org/scorecard/" target="_blank">NationalEnvironmental Scorecard</a>. The Scorecard provides an easy way togauge congressional voting records on top environmental issues. Ifyou want to know what legislators have done, rather than just whatthey promise, this is a great tool. Each senator and representativegets a score based on his or her voting record, from zero to 100;the higher the number, the better. The League maintains lifetimescores for legislators, as well as scores for their voting recordsin the most recent sessions of Congress. The Scorecard providesobjective and factual analysis of votes on the most importantenvironmental legislation considered. To select the votes andissues on which to grade members of Congress, the League relies onexperts from more than 20 respected energy, conservation andenvironmental organizations.<br /><br />It may come as a surprise that there are quite a few legislatorswith perfect scores for this session: 93 representatives and 19senators. Of those, all are Democrats except for twoIndependents.<br /><br />One example of how the scorecard could swing votes is with Sen.George Allen, R-Va., who faces a tight race in his bid forre-election. Allen has an LCV score of zero percent for the mostrecent session of Congress. Another close contest is in New Jersey,where incumbent Democrat Sen. Robert Menendez has a score of 100percent.<br /><br />Among the many incumbents caught in tight races for the House ofRepresentatives, two examples are Rep. Richard Pombo, R-Calif., whohas an LCV score of 17 percent; and Rep. Jim Ryun, R-Kan., who hasa score of zero percent.<br /><br />The latter two Republicans also earned dismal scores from thenonprofit <a href="http://www.repamerica.org/" target="_blank">Republicans for Environmental Protection</a> (REP)in its first scorecard. REP seeks to 'resurrect' the conservationtradition of the GOP exemplified by President Theodore Rooseveltand others. REP scores are similar in methodology to those fromLCV, except REP also adds or subtracts credit for non-votingactions that demonstrate positive or negative leadership onenvironmental issues; this factor gave Rep. Pombo a score of-12.<br /><br />Republicans with the best REP scores are Rep. Sherwood Boehlert(N.Y.), 108; Rep. Michael Fitzpatrick (Pa.), 100; Rep. Jim Saxton(N.J.), 100 and Sen. Lincoln Chafee (R.I.), 87.<br /><br />Check out the resources below to learn more about the candidatesand issues in this election.<br /><br /><b>Scorecards</b><br /><a href="http://www.lcv.org/scorecard/" target="_blank">League ofConservation Voters</a><br /><a href="http://www.repamerica.org/2005_scorecard.pdf" target="_blank">Republicans for Environmental Protection</a><br /><a href="http://uspirg.org/uspirg.asp?id2=24211" target="_blank">U.S. Public Interest Research Group</a><br /><br /><b>Endorsements</b><br /><a href="http://www.sierraclub.org/endorsements/2006/" target="_blank">Sierra Club</a><br /><br /><b>Election Guides</b><br /><a href="http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2006//" target="_blank">CNN</a><br /><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/ref/washington/2006ELECTIONGUIDE.html/" target="_blank">The New York Times</a><br /><a href="http://projects.washingtonpost.com/elections/keyraces/map/" target="_blank">The Washington Post</a><br /><a href="http://www.utne.com/webwatch/2006_273/news/12310-1.html" target="_blank">Utne Reader</a><br /><br /><b>Candidates' Backgrounds and Contributors</b><br /><a href="http://www.opensecrets.org/" target="_blank">Center forResponsive Politics</a><br /><a href="http://www.vote-smart.org/" target="_blank">Project VoteSmart</a><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />
