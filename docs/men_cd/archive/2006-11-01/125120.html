        It's the holiday season again, and the perfect time to indulge insome of the delicious homemade foods that come from our manydifferent food traditions. One good resource is Slow Food USA,whose slogan is 'Taste, tradition, and the honest pleasures offood.'<br /><br /><b>A Global Community</b><br />Slow Food International began in Italy in 1989 to help protectregional foods and styles of cooking that were rapidly beingoverwhelmed by the culture of fast food. The Slow Foodorganization, which celebrates a food culture of tradition,diversity and respect for the environment, now has 80,000 membersfrom 50 countries, including farmers, chefs and many other foodlovers.<br /><br /><b>Local Events</b><br />Closer to home, local chapters of Slow Food USA hold frequentevents across the United States, meeting (and eating) at farms,restaurants and everywhere in between. The<a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org" target="_blank">Slow Food USAWeb site</a> includes contact information to help people find localgroups, which are active in most major cities across thecountry.<br /><br /><b>Rediscovering Favorite Foods</b><br />Ready to reconnect with some holiday traditions? Here are a fewideas to try.<br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Regional apple varieties.</b> Far beyond 'Red Delicious' vs.'Granny Smith,' there are thousands of named apple varieties withdelicious and unique flavors. Most of these apples don't hold upunder shipping and long storage, so you'll enjoy the sweetestflavors if you find an orchard close to home.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Rare turkey breeds.</b> Many now rare breeds were once ourtraditional Thanksgiving turkeys, including 'Standard Bronze,''Narragansett' and 'Bourbon Red.' These birds are well suited to beraised in free-range conditions, and produce lean, flavorfulmeat.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li><b>Real wild rice from the Great Lakes region.</b> This is theonly grain native to North America and is an important part of theculture of local Native American communities. It is still harvestedin the traditional way, by canoe, by the Anishinaabeg people.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><br />You can learn more about these foods at<a href="http://www.slowfoodusa.org" target="_blank">www.slowfoodusa.org</a>, or try<a href="http://www.localharvest.org" target="_blank">www.localharvest.org</a>, to find local farmers andfarmer's markets.<br />
