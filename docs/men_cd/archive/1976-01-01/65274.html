                		<hr />    <p>      <em>Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there      were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming introductory      handbooks available, many of us welcomed the publication of      Richard Langer's Grow It! with open arms. Now that we're      all older and more experienced, however, some folks find it      increasingly easy to criticize that breakthrough beginner's      guide (see the Feedback sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and      25). Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is      just as important (probably more so) now as Grow It!.</em>    </p>    <h3>      FRUIT AND NUTS    </h3>    <p>      A man who refuses apple dumpling cannot have a pure mind.    </p>    <h3>      COLERIDGE    </h3>    <p>      It is one of the many disadvantages of the landlord and      tenant system that there are so few fruit trees in English      cottage gardens. No landlord is going to plant trees for      his tenants, and no tenant is going to plant trees for his      landlord. "No man," wrote that great prophet of the soil,      Philip Oyler, "unless he is a saint, can be expected to      give the land the same care (the care it needs) if he is a      tenant or an employee as he would as an owner." That is so      obvious that one would not think it necessary for anybody      to say it, but it is necessary. He also wrote: "We should      accept it as fundamental that each individual has a right      to a plot of the earth on which he was born to as much as      he and his family can farm well."    </p>    <p>      Assuming that our self-supporter does own the land he is      living on: his rightful share of the earth's surface shall      we take it?, he will obviously wish to plant fruit trees.      If there are any old neglected fruit trees on his land he      will be wise to leave them in a year or two and see if they      can be got to fruit well by heavy manuring, pruning (just      cut a lot of the branches out of it), and winter washing.      If the old tree still doesn't bear try root pruning, that      is digging down and cutting a lot of the roots with a sharp      spade. Bark-ringing is another method that has the same      effect: remove a strip of bark right round the tree a      quarter of an inch wide. More may kill the tree, but a      quarter of an inch is not too much for the bark to jump      again in a year or two so that the tree can go on growing.      Bark-ringing and root pruning give the tree a nasty shock,      which may be just what it wants to start it fruiting again.      You can't do this with stone fruit by the way, only apples      and pears.    </p>    <h3>      PLANTING    </h3>    <p>      Meanwhile, whether you have old trees or not, you should be      planting new ones. Do this any time when the sap is down,      i.e., in the winter, although November is supposed to be a      pretty good time to plant. Go to a neighboring fruit grower      (if there is one) or a local nurseryman, and get from him      the best varieties to plant on your soil. Get early      varieties as well as late, so as to spread the eating      season (late store better than earlies: the latter should      be eaten at once) and also get various kinds of trees,      i.e., some cordons or espaliers, some half-standards and      some standards. The reason for this is that your cordons or      espaliers, being small and kept small, will fruit several      years before your bigger trees, and thus will begin to give      you fruit fairly soon. The half standards will come into      fruiting next, possibly when your family or community is      increasing and you need more fruit, and the standards will      come last, but will go on and keep you in fruit for a      lifetime. They have the enormous advantage that animals can      graze beneath them. Three year old trees are best to buy,      although you might try to put one or two older trees in,      with enormous care, hoping that they won't die. I have seen      ten year old apple trees planted, and they survived, but it      was done by an expert.    </p>    <p>      As for varieties: this book is not long enough even to      discuss this subject. Either gen yourself up on this, or go      to a local expert. Make sure he knows about stocks too. It      is most important that your chosen variety is grafted on to      the right stock, i.e., a dwarfing stock for small trees      (such as Mailing No. 9 with apples), a non dwarfing stock      for large ones. If, your "expert" doesn't know about      stocks, find one that does.    </p>    <p>      Keep the roots of your little trees moist when you bring      them from the nursery. Dig large holes for each tree. Plant      in good, well drained, deep soil. Water logged soil will      simply kill them. Chuck some builder's rubble in the bottom      of your hole if you have any (it helps drainage and      provides lime in years to come), dump in a barrow load of      muck, shove in some soil, and then spread the roots of your      tree nice and evenly on the soil, so that the roots stay in      their natural shape and yet are all well in contact with      the soil. Adjust it so that the tree will be an inch or two      deeper than it was before. Put more good soil on the roots,      tamp it down well; have sympathy with the tree that you are      planting, imagine what you would feel like if you were a      tree and being planted, how you would like your roots      disposed of. It is that imaginative sympathy that some      people have got and others haven't that is called "green      fingers". Firm the soil well, but don't break the roots in      doing so. Put a little lime with the soil and when you have      filled the hole put a pound of lime on the ground around      the tree. Mulch it well too with muck, old straw, cut      nettles or bracken, or anything. The mulch keeps the soil      from drying out, suppresses weeds and creates humus. All      fruit trees, so far as I know, like lime. Stone fruit must      have it (stone fruit are cherries, plums, peaches, etc.).    </p>    <p>      As for spacing, remember that the trees will grow! It is a      very good plan to plant with the idea of using the land for      something else besides big fruit trees. For example, plant      wide apart rows, say 24 feet apart, with standards and 20      feet apart in the rows, and for years you will be able to      grow two rows of soft fruit between the rows of big trees.      When the standards spread somewhat only grow one row of      soft fruit. When the standards reach maturity don't grow      any. And here we might as well point out that the beauty of      growing standard trees (the biggest), in spite of what most      books on fruit growing tell us (they all say grow little      trees for speed and space saving), is that when they are      fully grown you can graze large animals underneath them.      The trees are high enough for the branches to be out of the      reach of grazing animals (who would otherwise rip them to      pieces animals love fruit trees). There is no more      productive use of land possible than a mature orchard of      standard fruit trees with grass and clover underneath and      animals grazing on it. All stock go well under fruit trees,      and do well, and do the trees good with their manure, and      their keeping of the grass short. Pigs (which have to be      ringed so that they don't damage the roots) will eat the      windfalls. But rotate your stock under the trees, as you      rotate stock on all land: never keep the same species of      animal on the same land for too long. Never make hay in      orchards-it starves the trees.    </p>    <p>      Until your trees are, say, five years old, keep the ground      just around their trunks bare. Either by mulching, or by      mattocking or hoeing, keep the turf away from their trunks.      And it doesn't matter how much muck you dump round those      trees every year. People will tell you that heavily manured      trees sometimes grow too fast and will not crop. I would      say let 'em grow and good luck to them they will crop one      day, and be the better trees for it. Try pruning them      harder, particularly in summer, and, when they get really      big, if they still don't crop root prune them.    </p>    <h3>      PRUNING    </h3>    <p>      Pruning is all a great mystery, and everybody has his own      idea about it. I know a man who says never prune at all,      just leave the trees to nature and they will give you      fruit. We have always pruned though and it seems to work.    </p>        <p>      Summer pruning is necessary for cordons and espaliers and      trees being trained up walls. It is also good sometimes for      a young tree which is growing too fast but shy about coming      into bearing. Winter pruning is much more general.      Immediately you have planted a tree, prune it to the sort      of shape that you are going to want. That is cut the      branches out of the centre of the tree, to some extent, so      as to keep the tree open in the middle and let the light      and air in. If two shoots are too near to each other cut      one out. Aim to have four or five evenly spaced branches,      and these branches, that you have left, must be shortened.      Cut about two-thirds of the last year's growth off the      branches that you are left with. The branches will shoot      again from the last bud that you have left before your      cut-so cut about half an inch from a bud that you wish to      grow. This will probably be on the under side of the      branch, for you wish to encourage the tree to assume an      open - centred cup-shape, with spreading branches. It is      important to prune hard this first year, because the      branches of the tree should balance the roots, and by      transplanting you have given the roots a pretty good shock,      so you must give the branches one. Two wrongs make a right,      in fact.    </p>        <p>      In the second year you must distinguish between leaders and      laterals. The leader on each branch is the shoot which      comes from the end bud and makes an extension of the      branch. Laterals grow from the branch behind it. You should      shorten the leaders by about half their length, cutting      again to a bud from which you want the new leader to grow.      Laterals you should either cut off completely, if you don't      want them, or more often cut them off to about three to      five inches. Three inches for a weak and flimsy lateral,      five for a stout one. These truncated laterals will then,      in time, form fruiting spurs. For the next couple of years      do much the same thing, but take less off the leaders until      you are just tipping them. By now you should have a      nicely-shaped tree, not overcrowded anywhere, nice and open      in the middle, with plenty of well spaced fruiting spurs.    </p>    <p>      After this, prune much more lightly. If they make very slow      growth prune harder-cut away half the leaders. If they make      too much growth don't prune. It has been said that they are      like us: "to those that hath shall be given, and from those      that hath not shall be taken away". That is, for fruit      trees, how it should be if they are to thrive. I'm not so      sure about ourselves.    </p>    <h3>      PEARS    </h3>    <p>      Pears treat like apples. But they are a more delicate tree,      and do best in sheltered positions, up against south facing      walls and so on. They need better treatment.    </p>    <h3>      PLUMS    </h3>    <p>      Plums like all stone fruit suffer from silver leaf disease,      which creeps into them by way of cuts. Except for the      winter in which you plant them they should not be      winter-pruned therefore, but pruned in May or June. They      can then heal the cuts more rapidly and keep the disease      out. Once they are shaped well leave them alone, the less      pruning the better. Cherries and peaches the same.    </p>    <h3>      SPRAYING    </h3>    <p>      Spraying should be kept to a minimum in the organic orchard      (when one meets commercial growers who have to spray      fifteen times a year one can only wonder why they don't      find an easier way of making a living!). But some spraying      is necessary. Winter washing, with stuff called Morteg, is      worth it, or some other tar distillate. It kills the lichen      and moss on the trunks of the trees, under which insect      pests grow, and kills the eggs of aphids and other      horribles. You must not winter wash after the end of      January for plums and pears or February for apples, or the      strong tar will kill the buds. Summer sprays are much more      complicated affairs and we don't do them unless we      absolutely have to (a bad caterpillar attack, for example,      when we spray derris) and if you must use them you must get      expert advice. But if you are only growing for your own      delight, and not to make a fortune, I don't advise much      spraying. Spraying kills pests it is true but it also kills      the creatures that prey on pests. Once you start      interfering with the balance of nature you may find      yourself like a dog chasing its tail.    </p>    <h3>      GREENGAGES    </h3>    <p>      Don't forget the humble greengage. I can remember as a boy      when most cottage gardens had their greengage trees at the      bottom of them, heavily laden with fruit in the late      summer, and what a marvellous flavour they were! And what      fine pies and puddings were made from them. Under their      shade the cottager kept tame rabbits in home made hutches,      the hinges of the doors made from strips of leather, and      the kind of cottager I liked best to associate with had      ferrets too. Greengages need a Victoria plum tree somewhere      near them to pollinate them.    </p>    <h3>      PEACHES    </h3>    <p>      Lawrence D. Hills, who knows more in the lobe of his left      ear about fruit growing than I know in my whole carcase,      says a three year-old bush Peregrine peach tree planted in      September or October or February should have any fruit lets      it grows in its first year. picked off, be allowed to rear      a dozen peaches the second year, forty the third year, and      enough to make you ill the fourth year-with new cider! You      should thin the fruits until they are eight inches apart.      The only peaches we have grown have suffered from leaf      curl. This because we did not spray them with lime sulphur      in late January and again perhaps in February. Alas-no      peaches.    </p>    <h3>      CHERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Cherries should be pruned, if at all, in mid-June, and      paint the wounds against silver leaf. But cherry growing in      England, where we have practically exterminated our hawks,      is a battle against birds.    </p>    <h3>      WALNUTS    </h3>    <p>      There is a sawmill owner in Shropshire who buys every piece      of good enough land that he can lay his hands on, and      plants it up with walnuts. He does this, he explains,      because his ancestors planted walnut trees for him to fell      now he wants to repay them by planting walnuts for his      grandson. They will be ready to fell in 130 years' time.      But meanwhile they will give an awful lot of walnuts and      what in the world can be nicer than walnuts?    </p>    <h3>      BLACKCURRANTS    </h3>    <p>      There is one soft fruit that every self-supporter should      have, and that is blackcurrant. This is because      blackcurrant has by far the biggest load of vitamin C,      which is the vitamin that very many people are short of, in      spite of the constantly reiterated statement that people      eating an ordinary modern diet get enough vitamins. They      get enough to stay alive and not get scurvy and that is      all.    </p>    <p>      Plant the blackcurrants 4 feet 6 inches apart or five foot      if you've got room. Prune so that the shoots come up from a      stool at near ground level. Every year, in the winter, cut      all the old, black wood out: the wood that has already      fruited. But do not prune the new wood, that has not yet      fruited, at all. For it is this that will bear the fruit      next year. Plant plenty of blackcurrants: we have a dozen      bushes but would like a dozen more. Manure very heavily      every year with muck. Pull weeds out as they grow. One day,      your blackcurrants may get big bud; enlarged buds looking      like Brussels sprouts but the size of a big pea. Put these      buds on the fire. One day they may get 'reversion' and the      leaves will look like nettles. Grub the bushes out and      carefully burn them. But before they get that you should      have planted more. You can grow more from healthy cuttings;      stick six inch long cuttings in the ground in a row in      November when you prune the old bushes. Leave them to grow      for three years before planting them out into your new      blackcurrant bed.    </p>    <p>      Red and white currants look beautiful but won't really feed      the multitudes. Prune them like apple trees, not like      blackcurrants which are completely different. You can let      grass grow between soft fruit if you keep it short.    </p>    <h3>      GOOSEBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Gooseberries you should prune also like apple trees but      hard. Give them plenty of potash wood ash is fine.    </p>        <h3>      RASPBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Raspberries are very useful and well worth growing. Plant      the stems that have grown up from the creeping roots of      somebody else's raspberries; cut the stem about eight      inches long with a bit of root attached about the same      length. Plant in October in rich land not too deep, a foot      apart in the rows and six foot between the rows. At each      end of each row drive in a post and have two parallel wires      between the tops of the posts and make the growing canes      grow between the two wires. In the autumn cut out some of      the old canes, right from the bottom, leaving not more than      half a dozen good young canes per plant. You'll have to dig      like mad every year alongside the rows to cut out the      creepers which will cover your whole garden if you don't      look out. Much like mad they're a greedy fruit. Our soft      fruit garden was a piece of waste land which when we came      here was practically devoid of soil: a little pocket of      stones and gravel dumped here in the ice age. It is now      deep black soil, and we get very heavy crops of both      raspberries and blackcurrants, although the gooseberries,      alas, aren't much cop.    </p>    <h3>      STRAWBERRIES    </h3>    <p>      Strawberries are a luxury and nothing more, but if you want      them cadge good runners off your neighbors, or buy from a      nursery, plant them in August in rich soil but no lime. The      strawberry is a woodland plant and woodland soil is acid.      Plenty of leaf mould is fine. Plant them shallow, with the      roots spread wide. Weed them like the devil. You can't      really hoe them because you would cut the roots. Mulch them      well with bracken, straw or leaf mould. Spray sluggit or      bait for slugs. The strawberry is a walking crop: it will      not crop for many years on the same land, so establish a      new bed every year, and every year (after you have got      going that long) dig up a three year old bed. You can use      your own runners for a while, but get in fresh blood every      few years as your stock will lose virility.    </p>    <h3>      TOMATOES    </h3>    <p>      In Suffolk we used to grow Moneymaker and Harbinger      tomatoes out of doors, and of these Harbinger were better      although in very good seasons Moneymaker had a bigger crop.      Being idle we used to buy the plants from a nursery, plant      them out in late May or even June on very good ground      against a south-facing wall, give them sticks to be tied      to, and pull off the little shoots that grow from the angle      between the stem and the branches and also shoots which      sprang up from the ground. When tomatoes begin to grow you      can feed the plants, like old-fashioned gardeners used to      do, with the delicious liquor from a barrel filled with      water and muck. Tomatoes suffer from blight in exactly the      same way as potatoes do (the two plants are very closely      related) and if you fear blight spray with Bordeaux mixture      or the proprietory Bulsol, and spray several times,. If      blight hits them you've had it. Unlike potatoes the part      you eat gets affected, the fruit will simply turn brown and      decay. Don't grow tomatoes twice on the same bit of ground      without a rest. They build up Lord knows what dreadful      infections.    </p>    <p>      If you insist on growing your own plants from seed, these      should be sown on a mixture of 1/3 sifted loam, 1/3 leaf      mould and 1/3 sharp sand, in gentle heat, in March. Growers      often soak this compost with boiling water a week before      sowing to kill creepies. Sow 1/4 inch deep in rows of one      inch apart. Thin out as soon as you can to 1/2 inch apart      in the rows. Water moderately with tepid water do not over      water. When they have made two leaves transplant to other      boxes two inches apart. End of April transplant plants      again this time to 4 inches apart. You will need more      patience than I have got. Tomatoes don't like lime.    </p>    <p>      Consider the idea of three dimensional farming. In Mallorca      I have seen large areas of very good land sparsely planted      with food bearing trees with good grass underneath on which      animals grazed. The trees were exploiting the      subsoil-bringing up minerals and trace elements from down      below where the grass roots could not get. The grass was      feeding the animals which in turn were manuring the trees.      Many of the trees were locust bean, producing a heavy crop      of high-protein stock feed. If we could find a tree that      produced a high protein food in the British climate we      would be well on the way to self-sufficiency.    </p>		<hr />
