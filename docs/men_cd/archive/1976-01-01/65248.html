                    <h5 id="byline">      by: Jean McCamy    </h5>    <p>      Cold weather and candlelight go together like that old      horse and carriage, so it's sort of fitting that winter      offers readymade molds for good, earthy candles.    </p>        <p>      Snow is a natural mold for the pouring of candles. You can      make any shape or size you want, and every piece is a one      of a kind original. Unusual forms even undercuts are no      problem, because a finished candle doesn't have to slip out      of a rigid mold once it has hardened, you can just dig it      out of its drift!    </p>    <p>      Ice can be used to make some good forms, too, though you      have to work a little harder to get it ready for your wax.      On the other hand, all you have to do to start an ice mold      is set a container of water outside to freeze so it's      really a pretty easy process.    </p>    <p>      Cold weather candles don't have to be made on a frozen,      blowy hillside. You can work either directly in the outside      snow or gather a bucketful and bring it inside where it's      warm. Inside is more comfortable, of course, but you do      have to work a little faster so your mold won't melt in mid      project.    </p>    <p>      Just about everybody knows the basic materials needed for      candle making: treated wax or remelted candles, good      quality wicking rather than string or twine, wax base dyes,      and oil base s cents. You should already be familiar with      these necessities of candle craft before you start      splashing wax around in the snowdrifts. (If you need      information on simple candle making, see "More on Candle      making" in MOTHER NO. 13. Better yet, order Contemporary      Candle making by William E. Webster, available from any      good bookstore or MOTHER'S Bookshelf.)    </p>    <p>      The wax for snow and ice molded candles does not have to      reach a particularly high temperature so long as it's      completely molten and hot enough for the dye to mix well.      To make your snow mold, simply dig out the shape you want      and pack and smooth the inside wall. (If there are holes in      the surface, wax will run through and you'll lose some or      end up with irregularities that you'll have to remove      later.)    </p>    <p>      Pour the hot wax into the impression and, as soon as the      edges and top of the pour become opaque, insert a piece of      wire a straight length of coat hanger will do nicely      wherever you want the wick to go. Once the wire is firmly      hardened into the wax (which will be much faster than for      an ordinary mold due to the low temperature of the snow)      lift or dig the candle out and let it harden completely.      Then remove the wire, insert your wick, and pour in      additional wax as necessary to anchor the wicking. Voila! A      candle with a textured surface and an unusual shape!    </p>    <p>      This method is ideal for making the tops of mushroom      candles. The stems, too, can be poured in snow, if you want      them uncoated, or can be sand cast for a multi textured      effect. Stems and tops are then joined by simply heating      the wax and pressing them together.    </p>    <p>      Candle molds made from ice require a bit more preparation,      unless you happen to have a frozen lake nearby and want to      just chip out a hollow form with an ice pick. The chipped      out shape I like best produces a candle with the texture      and appearance of a gnarled old tree trunk. To make it,      first fill a container such as a cut off milk carton with      water. Then place a smaller, unbreakable container (maybe a      tin can or paper cup) inside the larger one. Fill the cup      with something heavy so it won't bob around in the water.    </p>    <p>      Now, put the whole thing outside, or in the freezer if you      live in a balmy climate, and let it harden. As the mold      freezes, the water will exert pressure against the cup      bending it and forming a knotted, irregular but still      basically vertical impression.    </p>    <p>      When the ice has completely hardened, remove the small      container. (You may have to run a little hot water inside      or around it to loosen the can enough to get it out.) Chip      away bits of ice at the top of your impression if you want      it to look as if roots are coming out of the trunk of your      tree. Or, if you want a completely irregular shape, remove      the entire block of ice, crack it, and replace the pieces,      which will leave small open spaces between the chunks for      wax to seep into.    </p>    <p>      Finally, pour hot wax into the ice mold and, again, add a      wire when the pour begins to harden. Remove the candle as      soon as possible if you want a shiny surface, or leave it      until the surrounding ice melts away if you prefer a cloudy      finish. The wax will harden into complex ridges and swirls      that are impossible to reproduce with a standard mold.    </p>    <p>      Once you get started you can add your own touches: bits of      glass or beads pressed into the snow where they can be      picked up by the wax, leather thongs imbedded in the      candles so that they may be hung up, two colors of wax      poured in layers, or whatever suits your fancy. The      possibilities are endless when you use nature's most      versatile molding compound cold water.    </p>
