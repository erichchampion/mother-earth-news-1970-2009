                    <h5 id="byline">      by: Nancy Caduff    </h5>    <p>      This article honors a gift handed down to us by the pioneer      women of our country a skill conceived in poverty, pride,      and love and considered by some to be the only true      American folk art.    </p>    <p>      I'm talking about quilting, the craft of taking what you      have and piecing it together into a blanket a craft      which-sooner or later-naturally evolves into the more      complex art of combining odd pieces of fabric into      intricate patterns and designs.    </p>    <p>      I got started on this delightful pastime in the traditional      way: I had eight beds to cover warmly and few funds to do      it with. My only assets were a big bag of scraps and the      memory of Mom and Gram piecing material for quilts when I      was a child.    </p>    <p>      Since I'm a strong believer in the public library, that's      where I went for help and I recommend that you do the same.      Glorious works have been published on the subject of      quilting, and references to designs for the coverlets      abound in all the folk history and antique books. Also, if      there's a historical museum or landmark house near you,      visit it and copy down in a notebook the quilting ideas and      patterns you're sure to find there.    </p>    <p>      It's odd that, among all the wealth of available reference      material, I've never found a basic manual to show me step      by step how to make a quilt. The fact remains that I      haven't and my first attempt-a nine-block design, of which      there are more variations than minds to think them up-is      known accordingly as "Comedy of Errors".    </p>    <p>      I did everything wrong on my first attempt at quilting and      then learned later how I should have done it. And that's      why I've written this article: Amateur though I may be,      even after several quilts, I still think I can save other      beginners some trouble. Mainly, however, I hope to whet      your appetite for, and pass on the great tradition of, this      craft (as moms and grannies used to do).    </p>    <p>      just what is a quilt, anyway? Webster defines it as "a      cover, or coverlet, made by stitching one cloth over      another with some soft substance in between." And there      are, basically, three kinds: patchwork, applique, and      piecework.    </p>    <p>      Patchwork is "crazy quilting" piecing together in random      pattern any scraps of fabric you might have on hand and      finishing the whole with decorative embroidery stitches.      The result is beautiful in spite of itself. This kind of      work originated several hundred years ago among the      peasants of France and had a poor reputation with our early      settlers, who did very little of it. Nowadays it's an      especially good use for wools, velvets, fur, or other odds      and ends that you can't do anything else with.    </p>    <p>      Applique coverlets are made by stitching fancy designs onto      a backing of solid material and then padding and quilting      the whole thing. These days the makings are often      embroidered blocks, all cut out and packed up into kits but      early coverlets of this type were ornamented with pieces of      fabric that were carefully shaped, often puff-quilted (a      rather special technique), and stitched by ladies of old in      their drawing rooms, as only they could do it.    </p>    <p>      Piecework-what most of us now do-produces the type of      quilting best suited to today's purpose: that of using what      we have and recycling discarded goods. The scraps of fabric      used in piecework are all geometrical and uniform in shape      and size. (Designs based on the square and the triangle      work out best.)    </p>    <p>      People have always named their quilts, and still do with      phrases that reflect their own times, politics, lifestyle,      or what have you. When you browse through books on the      subject you run across such designs as "Wheel of Fortune",      "Odd Fellow's Path", "Storm-at-Sea", "Drunkard's Path",      "Flying Geese", "Robbing Peter to Pay Paul", "Old Maid's      Ramble", "Duck's Foot in the Mud", "Crown of Thorns", "Log      Cabin" (a very popular pattern), and on and on through an      endless list.    </p>    <p>      Maybe you'd like to try this old craft but lack the      well-filled ragbag of yesteryear. In that case, where do      you get the raw materials for a quilt? Everywhere! Ask a      grandma or try the door-to-door approach or the tell a      neighbor your 'remaking a quilt method (which always      produces more cloth than you know what to do with). Or      scrounge leftovers from the Goodwill. Or check with fabric      manufacturers (although they may make a small charge for      their remnants). Or drop in anywhere sewing is done. City      dwellers, for instance, may find themselves near a      tailoring shop, the alterations department of a store, or a      clothing manufacturer. (You'll wind up with a lot of knit      goods this way, and I'd love to hear what you do with      them.)    </p>
