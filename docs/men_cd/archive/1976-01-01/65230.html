                    <h3>      MEL WHITE    </h3>    <p>      One of the first things I noticed when I moved into my      apartment here in Chula Vista, California-a few miles south      of San Diego-was the fine old olive trees growing among the      landscaped shrubbery and lawns of the neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      "They're Mission olives," an old-time resident of the city      told me, "refugees from one of the many groves in this area      that have been ripped up and replaced by suburban      developments."    </p>    <p>      Olive trees, however-which have a very long life-don't stop      producing fruit just because they've become mere      decorations. Literally tons of olives go to waste in      southern California every year! Part of the crop, of      course, is consumed by starlings, one of the few birds that      will eat the bitter berries. The lush oval fruit also makes      super ammunition for the slingshot set (the ripe ones find      their target with a satisfying purple splat).    </p>    <p>      Few people try to harvest the olives, because they have a      dreadful taste fresh off the tree and must be processed in      one of several complicated ways. So most people just rake      them up and throw them away then pick up a can of the      "readymade" fruit at the supermarket.    </p>    <p>      Because I'm a frustrated farmer who wants to produce      something other than crab grass in his mini-yard, I decided      to try harvesting the luscious black olives hanging heavy      from the dozen or so trees near my apartment.    </p>    <p>      A little research into the art and science of preserving      olives, however, produced one clear message: Forget it! The      juicy black ones you buy in a can at the supermarket, I      learned, started their processing before they were ripe.      And, anyway, I didn't have room in my pad for all the      necessary crocks and vats.    </p>    <p>      Then I learned about Greek olives! You probably won't find      the delicacies in your grocery (I've only seen them in a      few specialized restaurants and delicatessens, and at very      high prices), and they're probably best classified as "an      acquired taste" for some people. But the shriveled,      slightly bitter "Greek cures" can be made from already-ripe      fruit.    </p>    <p>      The curing process is also easy, and the cost is next to      nothing when the olives are free.So, if you live in      southern California-or in any other semitropical area where      olive trees are grown just for their craggy beauty you may      want to try my method of harvesting and preserving their      fruit.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT YOU'LL NEED TO CURE OLIVES THE GREEK WAY    </h3>    <p>      You'll need a wooden box about six inches deep-the kind      that fruits and vegetables are often shipped in-that you      can probably get free at the local produce market. You'll      also have to round up a piece of burlap cloth big enough to      cover the inside bottom and sides of the container. Use      clean, new burlap if possible-enough to do the job will      cost you less than a dollar at the local dry goods      store-and bring the material up the sides and tack it along      the top edges, so the olives won't fall through the open      slots in the sides and bottom.    </p>    <p>      After your curing box is ready, you'll want to lay in a      good supply of salt about three-fourths as much, by weight,      as the amount of olives you plan to cure.    </p>    <h3>      AND, OF COURSE, OLIVES    </h3>    <p>      Ali, yes the olives. Gathering them may be a slight problem      if climbing trees isn't one of your favorite sports. I      solved that small dilemma by gathering up a few bottles of      coke, a portable radio for playing rock music, and some      idle teenagers who were attracted by the novelty of an      olive-picking party. Anyway, it worked the first time!    </p>    <p>      One final note on the harvest: Although the fruit shown in      the accompanying photos are the common Mission olives, the      variety traditionally cured, any "brand" will do. Just      concentrate on picking the smaller ripe fruit as the larger      ones get soft.    </p>        <h3>      HOW TO PROCESS YOUR OLIVES    </h3>    <p>      An initial washing in a kitchen colander will probably be      needed to remove dust and evidence of birds that frequent      the trees. Take the strainer outside, load it with fruit,      set the filled container on the patio or driveway, and      flush the colander's contents good with the garden hose.      Then lay newspapers on the grass and spread the wet fruit      out to dry.    </p>    <p>      Of course, all this could be done in the kitchen, but it's      surprising how much space the olives require, and you      always seem to have more of the fruit at this point than      you thought you had picked.    </p>    <p>      After the olives have dried, weigh them and then mix one      pound of salt with each two pounds of olives. Pour the      mixture into the wooden box with the burlap lining and      spread a layer of salt one inch deep over the top. The box      should be placed outdoors so that any brine which runs off      won't ruin your floor (but be sure to keep the container      under a shelter in case of rain).    </p>    <p>      Allow the olives to cure for a week, pour them into a      second box and then back into the original burlap-lined box      again. This mixing procedure should be repeated once every      three days until the olives are cured and edible (it      usually takes 30 to 35 days). Along the way, pick out any      individual specimens that become soft or get broken open.    </p>    <p>      After a month-when the fruit will have become well      shriveled-separate out the salt with a kitchen strainer or      that plastic sand sifter the kids use at the beach.    </p>    <p>      The colander is then used again to dip the olives for a few      seconds into boiling water. After they've drained, let them      dry overnight in, say, cookie sheets lined with paper      towels.    </p>    <p>      Once the fruit is thoroughly dry, mix about a pound of salt      into each 10 pounds of olives and store your processed      harvest in a cool place. The olives will keep this way for      about a month, but if you want to store them for longer      periods, put them in your refrigerator or freezer.    </p>    <p>      If you're into Greek, Italian, and Spanish cooking, you'll      find dozens of ways to eat your olives. They're especially      delicious, for instance, in tamale pie and spaghetti and my      favorite use for them is as a relish.    </p>    <p>      To prepare cured olives as a relish, just sprinkle the      fruit with olive oil and mix thoroughly until each one is      completely coated with oil. That's it! And no coating of      oil is needed at all to make the processed olives ready for      tamale pie, spaghetti, and other cooked dishes.    </p>    <p>      So. If you live in an olive-growing region, quit missing      out on a good bet. Instead of raking up all those messy      ripe olives, pick them before they fall, spend two dollars      and a little time, and process yourself ten pounds of      Greek-cured olives.    </p>    <p>      And believe me: that quantity of the delicacies would cost      you a bundle at the delicatessen. And when you proudly      serve yours to your friends, the fruit will be worth twice      as much because you cured it yourself.    </p>

The finished product ain't much to look at, but will provide plenty of mighty tasty eating over the months to come. Your olives will lend zest to foods, or will make great relish. And it sure beats paing high supemarket prices!
