                        <p>      Need the cheapest fishing pole possible to catch panfish?      Attach an empty spool of thread to the thick end of a stick      with a one-inch nail. On the thin end of the stick screw in      an eye screw. Put a line on the spool and rein it through      the eye.    </p>    <p>      And if the fishing hole is not giving any fish lately, toss      in old Christmas trees in one heap, and make sure they're      entirely covered by water. There'll be fish living there in      less than six months.    </p>    <p>      Need a photo frame? Cut the top layer of bark from a birch      tree. You won't hurt the tree. Put weight, such as a huge      book, on the bark while it dries. To attach the photo to      the bark, use any kind of sticky putty that doesn't dry. A      halved pinecone can adorn one corner.    </p>    <p>      Every home with children can have a free activity box.      Shells from a lake or the sea, rocks of all colors, twigs,      wood scraps, tiles, yarns, any twines, papers, any leftover      building materials all go in the box. When the cry "I'm      bored" is heard, it's time to get the box and suggest a      "make one" project. Nature and leftovers can provide the      materials.    </p>    <p>      <em>D.A.
