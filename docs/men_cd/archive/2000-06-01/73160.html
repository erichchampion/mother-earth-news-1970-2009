                    <p>      <strong>Planting, harvesting and<br />      harnessing soy.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Biz Fairchild Reynolds    </h5>            <p>      At first glimpse, it appears to be such a boring little      lean, hard and flat and round. Even the short, nondescript      name "soy" belies the incredibly amazing properties hidden      within this unassuming yet extremely versatile legume. In      fact, the Chinese, who historically were the first to use      the soy bean for food, have for centuries called it "Yellow      Jewel," "Great Treasure" and "Brings Happiness."    </p>        <p>      Soybeans have always been a lucrative crop in the U.S.      (third in importance, after corn and wheat). We are the      world's leading producer of soybean oil and meal, and the      leading exporter as well. Almost 40% of our soybean crop is      exported.    </p>    <p>      Here in farm country, most folks think of soybeans as      either an easy-to-grow market crop, or as an animal feed.      But with a protein content of 40%, soy can also be an      important part of a vegetarian diet if eaten along with      grains and nuts.    </p>    <p>      Historians think soybeans may have been domesticated as      early as the 11th century B.C. in Northwestern China.      Introduced in Europe in the 18th century and to America in      the early 19th century, the first soybeans to be grown in      the U.S. were grown in Pennsylvania - as a garden      ornamental. Soon the bean became a common forage crop, used      for hay, silage and pasture. But it was not until oil was      first commercially extracted from the seed in the early      1900s that the soybean became invaluable - almost      overnight. By 1929, a significant part of the soybean crop      was being crushed for oil, and processing plants    </p>        <p>      were quickly established. From a staple food crop in Asia      to a multiple-use crop grown worldwide, the soybean's      future continues to expand as a remarkable range of new and      improved products are formulated with the humble soybean as      the main ingredient.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        WHY EAT SOYBEANS?      </h3>      <p>        Soybeans are superior in protein to any other legume (35%        to 45%) and are even higher in protein than lean beef -        yet without cholesterol. Soy also has a good balance of        essential amino acids and naturally contains Omega-3        fatty acids. Furthermore, 25 grams of soy protein added        to the diet has been proven to lower LDL - "bad"        cholesterol. Soybeans are easily digested, yet are high        in fiber. They contain vitamin E, calcium, potassium and        genistein, a cancer-fighting component. At least five        other anticarcinogens have been identified in the soybean        as well.      </p>      <p>        It's too early to be sure, but there is hope that        soybeans in the diet may also reduce the risk of breast        cancer, prostate cancer, hot flashes and osteoporosis.      </p>    </div>    <h3>      First Plantings    </h3>    <p>      The soybean <em>(Glycine max)</em> is an annual legume and      a member of the pea family. Unlike its wild ancestor, which      was a viney and rather floppy plant, the modern soybean has      been bred to stand erect; in a good year some varieties      reach a height of up to six feet. (Our farm beans are      usually waist high). Soybeans grow from a branched taproot      that exists in the top four to eight inches of soil. Its      self-pollinated flowers are small, blooming either purple      or white.    </p>    <p>      All soybean varieties are palatable, but the special      "edible" varieties are less oily and better for human      consumption. Popular edible varieties include Kanrich,      Frostbeater, Pickett, Prize, Kim, Disoy, Bansei, Fuji,      Verde, Seminole and Green Giant, all of which make good      green crops and produce many pods.    </p>    <p>      Few Americans consider soybeans when planning their      gardens. Still, they are gaining in popularity. Hundreds of      soybean varieties have been developed over the years,      exhibiting numerous plant characteristics and seed colors,      including the most common buff-colored type. The University      of Illinois has a collection of over 7,000 different beans,      showing the enormous genetic variation occurring within the      same species - red, green, mottled, speckled, round, oval,      lentil-like, striped, and so forth.    </p>        <h3>      Get the Best Seed    </h3>    <p>      We buy our farm seed from a certified seedsman. If you want      to know the exact variety and history of your seed,      including whether it was organically grown, if it has been      treated or if it is a genetically modified (GM) bean, you      should seek out a reputable seed dealer. (For more on GM      crops, see "Brave New Food" in the last issue of MOTHER.)      If you are not choosy, you may find a farmer willing to      sell you a bucket of beans from the combine hopper (which      is how we get our eating beans). These need only be stored      in a dry place until the following spring. (If you'll be us      ing them as food right away, wash well just before cooking,      being careful to pick out any cockleburs, black beans or      grasshopper parts!) Expect to pay about $5 per bushel at an      elevator; cleaned seed from a dealer is about $16 per      bushel. Either way, that's cheap eating, as one bushel of      beans weighs about 60 pounds. Finding mail-order edible      soybean seed for home planting is a bit difficult, but      Seeds of Change, located in Santa Fe, New Mexico, and      available at (888) 762-7333 or      <em>http://store.yahoo.com/seedsofchange ,</em> offers      these two varieties:    </p>         			<p>      Also, Thompson & Morgan, another interesting mail-order      seed seller from Europe <em>( www.thompson-morgan.com      ),</em> includes the following in its offerings:    </p>    			<h3>      GROWING AND HARVESTING<br />      Temperature    </h3>    <p>      To grow soybeans, which will succeed in almost any climate,      wait until the soil has warmed in the spring ...usually a      week after optimum corn-planting time in your area, when      soil has reached a minimum temperature of 60°F (that      means May or June in most of the U.S.). Minimum temperature      for seed germination is 43°F, and minimum temperature      for actual crop growth is 50°F. Optimum temperatures,      however, are from 68°F to 77°F Beans can be planted      through June and even into July, but the earlier you plant,      the better crop you will harvest. (A lack of moisture later      in the summer can greatly affect bean formation.)    </p>    <h3>      Soil    </h3>    <p>      Soybeans prefer a loamy soil, but will also tolerate poor      drainage. They will grow in all types of soils, but a pH      range from 5.5 to 6.5 (slightly acidic) is considered      optimal. Phosphorus, potassium and nitrogen are major      nutrients required for good plant growth.    </p>    <h3>      Spacing    </h3>    <p>      Plant the seeds 1 1/2" deep, unless you are planting them      late. (In that case, since the ground will be much drier,      push them to twice that depth.) Garden books suggest that      you plant eight seeds per foot of garden row. This may      sound a bit close, as the soybean plants are quite large;      but this close spacing allows the floppy plants to hold      each other up, and the beans will produce excellently.    </p>    <h3>      Fertilizer    </h3>    <p>      Fertilizing soybeans is not a common practice, unless the      soil is known to be deficient in phosphorus and potassium.      (In some ways soybeans actually replenish the soil.) On the      farm, our cooperative comes out and spreads phosphate and      potash granules over the fields before planting begins. But      this is mainly because we reuse the soil repeatedly for the      same crop, which slowly depletes the ground of needed      nutrients. Sometimes we rotate and plant corn instead.    </p>        <p>      Nitrogen is important to soybean culture. But soybeans,      like other legume crops (peas, alfalfa, clover), have the      capacity to "fix" nitrogen in the soil, thanks to certain      bacteria contained in the nodules that form their roots.      These bacteria convert nitrogen from the air into such      compounds as ammonia and nitrate (which green plants need      to live and grow), thus reducing soy's need for a nitrogen      fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      But as with any bean, adding innoculants to your soy crop      will both allow plants to better fix nitrogen in the soil      and improve the yield. <em>Inexpensive</em> i nnoculants      may be purchased from seed catalogs and in hardware stores.    </p>    <h3>      Cultivation    </h3>    <p>      If you plant soybeans in rows, they can be better      cultivated . Weeds will reduce yields. As soon as possible      after planting, begin working between the rows with a      tractor or tiller if you've planted a big plot. Hoeing      between the plants is also worthwhile, since clean      cultivation will ensure more beans. As the beans grow,      adjust the tiller shields so that dirt rolls around the      base of the plants. Knee-high beans are too tall for      further cultivating, since this could seriously damage the      plants and the roots.    </p>    <p>      Most large-scale farmers are forced to use an herbicide.      Small-scale growers should be able to hand-check the weeds.    </p>    <p>      The beans can also be planted broadcast-style, then worked      into the ground with a tiller. But this stand will be much      weedier, as you will be unable to till it. If, however, the      last crop you grew on the same spot was weed-free, weed      control may not be such a problem.    </p>    <h3>      Moisture    </h3>    <p>      Keep soybeans watered as you would the rest of your garden.      Some moisture is necessary for germination, of course, and      during early development. Indeed, it's most important that      the plants receive rainfall (or artificial watering) at the      time of their seed-filling period. Soybeans are, however,      tough little guys that can withstand some drought once they      are well established. We have seen them withstand week      after week of high temperatures, hot winds and no rainfall,      provided they got their early moisture.    </p>    <h3>      Pests    </h3>    <p>      These days there are few pest insects to bother soybeans,      although the number of Mexican bean beetles, velvet bean      caterpillars and Japanese beetles are on the rise. At      current levels, these pests can usually be controlled by      natural predators and viral diseases. There are also less      serious insects that may occasionally bother soybeans, such      as cutworms, grasshoppers and army worms.    </p>    <p>      As the beans mature, fungal diseases can become quite      destructive, making it difficult to save seed. But in      general, insects and disease pose a much greater threat to      soy crops in tropical environments than in our own      temperate climate .    </p>    <div class="sidebar">		<div class="image">      <img src="../images/180-062-01tab.jpg" alt="180-062-01tab.jpg" width="317" height="464" />    </div>    </div>    <h3>      Harvest    </h3>    <p>      The length of the growing season varies from 50 to 200      days, depending on the variety, weather, latitude, etc. For      dry harvest, soybeans should be allowed to stand in the      field while the pods dry and mature, turning a huff to      yellow color. During this time, the leaves will first turn      yellow and then drop off. Not to worry, though: a good      frost will help to ripen the crop, quicken the leaf fall      and short en the waiting time until harvest - and it won't      damage the beans.    </p>    <p>      The fully ripe beans are left to dry in the fields; the old      brown stems and pods are left standing until dry, with the      moisture content falling to about 13%.    </p>    <p>      On a good day here on the farm, we c an combine 3,000      bushels of beans from 60 acres; this, despite the late      start we get, waiting almost till noon for the moisture to      burn off the fields. In the fall, the dust and chaff of      thousands of Midwest soybean fields fill the air, as      combines run day and night to bring in the harvest before      the fall rains. Harvesting a backyard crop of soybeans for      home use is a little more labor-intensive. A single soybean      plant may form as many as 40 hanging pods, each one      containing two or three round seeds (about 1/4" across) and      weighing about 120 to 200 milligrams.    </p>    <p>      If you are growing a small quantity of beans, you can cut      and thresh them by hand. Cut the stalks, stuff them in a      burlap bag, then trample them, beat them or run them over      with your pickup. The resulting tangle can be winnowed by      pouring the beans from one bucket to another, either      outdoors in a brisk breeze, or in front of a large fan.    </p>    <p>      Store the cleaned beans in containers in a dry, protected      area. Food moths, weevils, rodents, mildew - none of these      food-damaging agents seem to care enough to bother the      rock-hard shell of the uncooked soybean.    </p>    <p>      If you want to harvest the beans in the green stage, you      can gather, cook and freeze them as you would garden peas.      Steam the green, still-tender pods for about ten minutes,      pour off the water and remove the hull. This will be a slow      process. Some folks simply pull the green shell between      their teeth and pop out the green seeds that way. Green      soybean harvest may be stretched over several weeks, as the      beans at the base of the stalks dry first, then gradually      the ones higher up - very much like garden peas.    </p>    <p>      You may also choose to plow your soybean plants under as a      green manure before the seeds have formed far enough to      reseed. Or, bundled and hung to dry, the plants make      nutritious rabbit or chicken feed. Hay can even be made      from soybean stalks cut and dried during August, when the      chances of rain are small. Soy hay does, however, take good      deal longer to cure than other hays.    </p>    <h3>      Eating    </h3>    <p>      It was raised eating pressure-cooked soybeans and still      enjoy them, steaming hot and with a little salt. Whole      beans can be used in soups, made into "baked beans" and      ingeniously transformed into myriad protein-rich foods.      They can be ground coarsely for making roasts or burgers,      or used as a meat extender. Soaked briefly, drained and      deep-fried or baked, soybeans can be delicious snacks -      similar to but infinitely better for you than those sold at      the supermarket.
