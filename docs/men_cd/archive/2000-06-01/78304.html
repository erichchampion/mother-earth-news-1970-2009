                    <p>      <strong>Which model works best?</strong>    </p>    <p>      First and foremost, have your water tested and determine      what specifically <em>needs</em> to be filtered. Despite      advertising claims, no filter can remove all water      contaminants - and some remove too many beneficial      minerals. No nonelectric filter can remove live bacteria.      These must be eliminated by boiling or in a separate,      prefiltration chlorine-treatment stage.    </p>    <p>      Some filters contain a single (ceramic or      carbon/ion-exchange) element; others offer multistage      filtration combining two to five of the following      filtering/purification systems:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mechanical particulate</strong> filter elements of      fine-grained, porous ceramic that strain out dirt, sediment      (turbidity) and other particles, including asbestos,      parasitic flukes and their egg cysts, and some large      bacteria. The government pure-water filtering standard is      .05u (half a micron), but some filters will eliminate      particles as small as .01u - small, but larger than most      bacteria. Many portable hiker's ceramic filters can be      renewed by simply scraping off the outer surface on the      rough leg of your jeans.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Activated carbon</strong> filters contain beads of      bone charcoal (elemental carbon) that are superheated/dried      to become ionized, so they naturally attract metallic      elements and many stray organic molecules. They capture      lead, mercury, chlorine, sulfur, VOCs (volatile organic      chemicals such as the pesticide Lindane) and biological      sources of bad taste and odor. Carbon filters can be partly      restored by washing and superdrying.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Reverse osmosis</strong> filters force water      through a semipermeable membrane that removes salt, heavy      metals, most chemicals and many other microscopic      impurities, including VOCs and nitrates. They do      <em>not</em> reliably filter out bacteria.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Ion-exchange</strong> filters, as used in      single-cartridge, faucet-mount filters and in large water      softeners, expose water to plastic beads coated with      ionized salts that capture nitrates, many minerals,      including lead and mercury, and the iron, magnesium and      calcium that can give water an off-color or off-taste. Some      can be recharged - and contaminants washed away - in a      disposable bath of strong brine, so they can be used for      years. WARNING: One of our editors sees a dentist who warns      against too-soft, overdemineralized water (such as      steam-distilled "pure spring water"), as it deprives us of      minerals that are essential to lifelong strong teeth and      bones.    </p>    <p>      <strong>UV generators,</strong> included in some      top-of-the-line, multistage home countertop, undercounter      and central filters, expose water to natural ultraviolet      (sunburn) light radiation that kills living parasites and      bacteria, but not all cysts and eggs (these must be      filtered out in another stage).    </p>    <p>      Save instruction sheets and be sure to clean, renew or      replace filter or purification elements as indicated - some      after a given number of months, others after a number of      gallons of water.    </p>
