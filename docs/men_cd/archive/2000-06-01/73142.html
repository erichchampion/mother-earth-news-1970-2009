                        <p>      If unchecked, pollution may accomplish what centuries of      war, land attrition and prejudice could not: the end of the      Native American.    </p>    <p>      The Indigenous Environmental Network (IEN), along with      Greenpeace and most recently the United Nations, has been      tracking the alarming increase in Native American death      rates directly attributable to persistent organic      pollutants, or POPs. These chlorine-based substances, such      as dioxin, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), chlordane, DDT      and many others, have been found in the fishing waters and      bird habitats of tribal lands. Since both tradition and      necessity make hunting and fishing in integral part of      Native American life, the poisons hit these populations      disproportionately. Unable to rid itself of POPs through      the liver, the body stores them in fat, amplifying their      carcinogenic and reproductive consequences.    </p>    <p>      Tom B. K. Goldtooth, national coordinator for the IEN, sees      what is happening among his people as only the beginning of      a global POP health crisis. "Those who imagine that we are      not vitally connected to every living species and people      are living in ignorance. Dangerous air and water are a      shared risk."    </p>    <p>      The fact that airborne POPS are capable of traveling      thousands of miles before landing in soil or water sources      (thereby making the U.S. ban on the use of DDT, for      instance, all but worthless) only adds poignancy to      Goldtooth's assertions. His IEN has helped produce a film      detailing the plight of POP-affected populations and      advancing the cause of a worldwide POP ban. The film,      entitled <em>Drumbeat for Mother Earth,</em> is available      for $29.95 (proceeds go directly to the Indigenous      Environmental Network) through Bullfrog Films; call (800)      543-3764 or visit the Web at <em>www.bullfrogfilms.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Matt Scanlon<br /></em>    </p>
