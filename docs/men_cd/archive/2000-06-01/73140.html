                    <p>      <strong>Recycled plastic finds<br />      new life as lumber.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Dear Mother,<br />      <em>The redwood timbers I used for my raised beds need to      be replaced, and someone suggested that I use recycled      plastic wood. But I've also</em> <em>heard that the plastic      leaches chemicals into the ground, and since this is a      vegetable garden, I want to be as safe as possible. Any      advice?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Barbara W.</em><br />    </p>    <p>      A handful of manufacturers nationw ide are busy turning      heaps of our plastic waste into durable "lumber." Know      those bins in supermarket entries where you stuff used      plastic grocery sacks? More and more, the contents are      being sold to plastic lumber companies for recycling,      instead of going to a landfill to resist decomposition      forever.    </p>    <p>      Some companies, like the Colorado-based Ecodeck and Phoenix      Recycled Plastics of Conshohocken, Pennsylvania, use 100%      recycled plastics; others, including the Trex Company of      Winchester, Virginia, mix reclaimed plastics with      industrial waste hardwood fibers to produce artificial wood      planking.    </p>    <p>      Intended mainly for outdoor use, plastic lumber is      waterproof and inert and will never need replacing, unlike      even the most thoroughly poison-impregnated (with copper      and arsenic) conventional pressure-treated (PT) lumber.      Termites can't eat it and molds won't infiltrate it.      Nothing can soak in or leach out so it's ideal for raised      beds.    </p>    <p>      We have used Trex lumber for planking outside decks and for      building indoor-outdoor furniture. It is denser and heavier      than softwood dimension lumber and lacks wood's natural      s cents and textures. (and its knots, splits, warps and      splinters). But it saws, planes, nails and accepts paint as      well or better than wood. Left unfin ished, Trex weathers      to a light silvery gray, similar to cypress or cedar.    </p>    <p>      The only comparative disadvantage we can see with Trex is      that it lacks the long fibers of wood and so is unsuitable      for load-carrying structural use, and must be      well-supported using 16"-on-center or closer floor joists.      This is irrelevant if using it in the garden, but a caveat      that its maker always includes in case someone wants to      purchase it for nonrecommended use.    </p>    <p>      While plastic lumbers are not biodegradable, they are      completely recyclable. And they need none of the      air-polluting evaporative stains, wood preservatives, mold-      and mildew-killers and insect-deterrents needed to maintain      a wood deck. Of course, you can't burn the short scraps in      the fireplace - but you shouldn't burn pressure-treated      lumber either, lest you, your kids, pets and wildlife      breathe in heavy metal-poisoned smoke.    </p>    <p>      We found plastic lumber kind of clunky to work with...      carries like deadweight, lacking the live springiness of      wood. But so what? It will last forever and won't poison      your earthworms, lettuce and tomato plants or you.    </p>    <p>      For information about Trex, dial (800) BUY-TREX or visit      <em>www.trex.com .</em> Phoenix Recycled Plastics can be      reached at (610) 940-1590 or on the Web at      <em>www.plasticlumberyard.com .</em> Ecodeck is available      through Environmental Building Products, Inc., (303)      470-7555; <em>www.environmentalbldgprod.com</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dear Mother,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We are considering a pellet stove as a primary</em>      <em>source of heat. However, a colleague told me that      the</em> <em>pellet dust is a significant problem for      people</em> <em>with asthma and other sensitive upper      respiratory conditions,</em> <em>Is this true?</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Donna R.</em>    </p>    <p>      Wood pellets are made largely from clean, white-wood      sawdust that is a byproduct of furniture or lumber      production (on the West Coast from fir and cedar, on the      East from mixed hardwoods). Manufacture is a two-part      process: First, the raw material is dried. Then it is      ground and forced through an extruder under pressure and      sufficient heat to melt resins so they solidify on cooling      into solid pellets.    </p>    <p>      Many people sneeze on breathing raw, resinous sawdust. But      dust is not produced in the palletizing process, and the      final product is firmly compacted enough so that it does      not produce dust on being poured. Indeed, pellets are being      poured today from the bag into stove hoppers located in a      half-million living rooms worldwide. If dust were a      problem, we'd have heard about it in many languages by now.    </p>    <p>      To perform properly in the auger- or gravity-feed system of      a pellet stove, the fuel must be of a consistent dryness,      size and pourability, and it must lack dust or fines (which      can be a problem when using low-quality dry field corn, a      popular pellet fuel substitute in many corn-growing areas).      If you find any dust in your 40-pound bags of pellet fuel,      demand your money back and get another brand.    </p>    <p>      Do you have a question that only MOTHER can answer?
