                        <p>      Vegetables have long been regarded as one of nature's      greatest gifts. Broccoli fights cancer, carrots sharpen      vision, but who could have guessed that corn would prevent      head contusions? If Dow Chemical and Cargill Company have      anything to say about it, your bicycle helmet will be made      with maize.    </p>    <p>      Cargill Dow Polymers (CDP), a joint venture of Cargill      Company and Dow Chemical, has invented a new biodegradable      polymer made from corn that may revolutionize the plastic      industry.    </p>    <p>      Using a patented process called NatureWorks, CDP      extracts unrefined sugar from corn and, through      fermentation, transforms it into lactic acid. Water is then      removed from the lactic acid to form lactide, which in turn      is refined to produce polylactide polymers (PLA). Commonly      known as bioplastic, PLA is biodegradable and can be      composted in your backyard along with your table scraps.    </p>    <p>      "Not only are we using biodegradable components to      manufacture plastic, but we can compete with your stan dard      oil-based plastics on a cost and performance basis," says      John Ohman, marketing executive for CDP.    </p>    <p>      Already a leader in the production of ethanol, a gasoline      additive made from corn, CDP is banking on bioplastics to      outpace traditional petro polymers. Sure to help the cause      are skyrocketing oil prices, which over the last year have      doubled worldwide.    </p>    <p>      Finally headed for market after ten years on the drawing      board, PLA will be produced in a $300 million CDP plant      being built in Blaire, Nebraska, and scheduled to open in      2001.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Eben Carle</em>    </p>
