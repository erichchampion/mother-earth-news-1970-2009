                    <p>      To get the most out of my worm soil, I practice crop      rotation. Fresh-from-the-pile worm soil is used in early      spring to plant members of the nightshade family.      Afterthese are harvested, I follow up in the same rows with      a fall crop from the mustard family, without adding any      additional worm soil. The following spring, I again use the      same rows - and worm soil - to grow vegetables from the      gourd family. I continue in this way until the worm soil is      exhausted, at which point I renew the row with fresh worm      soil and begin again with the nightshade family.    </p>    <p>      s Below is a list of some common garden plants, arranged      according to family and species. It's the family      designation you want to keep in mind when planning your      crop rotation. Plant this year's tomatoes where last year's      peppers stood, and you're asking for disappointment; both      are members of the nightshade family, and so require the      same soil nutrients.			</p>
