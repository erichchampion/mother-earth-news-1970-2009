                    <p>      I found some old, old recipes that belonged to my      great-grandmother and thought your readers might be      interested in not only the content, but the brevity with      which they chose to keep recipes.    </p>    <h3>      Rice and Apples    </h3>    <p>      <em>Core as many nice apples as will fill a dish; boil them      in light syrup. Prepare 1/4 pound rice in milk and sugar      and salt, put some of the rice in the apples, then fill up      the intervals with the rice and bake in the oven until it      is a fine color.</em>    </p>        <h3>      Marlborough Pie    </h3>    <p>      <em>Grate 6 apples, 1 cup of sugar, 3 tablespoons melted      butter, 4 eggs, juice</em> <em>and grated rind of lemon, 2      tablespoons of brandy or wine, if you choose; if not, omit      it. Bake in an under, but without a top crust.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Washington Pie    </h3>    <p>      <em>3 eggs, 1 cup sugar, a scant 1/2 cup milk, 1/2 teaspoon      soda, 1 teaspoon cream tarter, 1 cup flour, a piece of      butter the size of a hen's egg, spice to taste, this makes      three layers. Spread with jelly.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Prune Pie    </h3>    <p>      <em>Slew the prunes, as for sauce, store mad sweeten, and      with a nice pie crust I think you will call them good. Be      sure not to have them too dry.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Geri Rankin<br /></em> <em>Otis, OR</em>    </p>
