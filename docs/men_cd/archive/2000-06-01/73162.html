            		<p><strong>BABIES AND SOY:</strong>		</p>        <p>      Considering all of soy's health benefits, it is tempting      for new and expectant mothers to see soy-based infant      formula as a "miracle food" and to stock their pantries      sky-high with the stuff. Well, hold on there, mama: That      most vulnerable member of the population, an infant unable      to breastfeed, stands at great risk of developing a serious      thyroid disorder due to a diet based entirely on soy      formula.    </p>    <p>      That disorder is hypothyroidism, or an underactive thyroid,      and it is a common cause of fatigue, depression, obesity,      constipation, extreme sensitivity to cold and a number of      other symptoms, most so common that the disorder can go      undiagnosed for years. Since hormones from the thyroid      gland regulate all other glands in the body (and thereby      all human growth and development), altered thyroid hormone      levels in infants may lead to disorders of the central      nervous system and abnormal psycho-motor development, as      well as slowed sexual development later in life.    </p>    <p>      Most soy foods, excluding soy oil and soy sauce, contain      estrogenic compounds, known as isoflavones. These compounds      are commonly thought to he protective against heart      disease, stroke, diabetes and osteoporosis, while reducing      the risk of breast, prostate and uterine cancers. You may      find it ironic, then, that isoflavones can also be      responsible for bringing on a hypothyroid condition.    </p>    <p>      Recent research by Japan's Ishizuki Thyroid Clinic and New      Zealand's Ministry of Health (MOH) has helped determine the      degree of danger soy's isoflavones pose. MOH research from      1998 shows that infants fed solely a soy-formula diet are      exposed to 16 times more isofilavones than the amount      necessary to cause goiter (enlargement of the thyroid due      to poor functions in adults. The danger is especially great      if soy formula is given to infants for longer than three      months. Because this danger has long been known, many      manufacturers add iodine, which is necessary for thyroid      function, to their formulas. This does tend to prevent the      onset of goiter, but in many cases does not prevent the      underlying hypothyroid condition indicated by the goiter.    </p>    <p>      Because of their many documented benefits, isoflavone      supplements have become a common part of adult preventative      medicine regimens. But the Ishizuki study showed that      isoflavone intake by healthy adults could also have a      thyroid-suppressing effect. The study concluded that 33mg      of soy isoflavones per day was sufficient to cause goiter      in adults. Yet some popular supplements provide from 40 to      120 mg of soy isoflavones daily.    </p>    <p>      Hypothyroidism can be detected by your doctor through blood      tests and can be treated, though not reversed. If your      child was raised on soy formula and exhibits developmental      problems, depression, obesity or especially low energy, it      may be a good idea to have your pediatrician conduct the      necessary checks. Through preventative measures, you could      keep your child from suffering future effects of      hypothyroidism.    </p>    <p>      For more information on the connection between soy foods      and hypothyroidism, see Mary Shomon's book: <em>Living Well      With Hypothyroidism: What Your Doctor Doesn't Tell You That      You Need to Know</em> (Wholecare, 2000).    </p>    <p>      <em>- Katie Mehrer</em>    </p>
