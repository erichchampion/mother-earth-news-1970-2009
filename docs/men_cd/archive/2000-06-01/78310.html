                        <p>      <strong>The hunter stalked his prey</strong><em>through the awakening      forest. As the early rays of the sun filtered through the      branches overhead, he moved noiselessly from tree to tree.      Finally halting, he quickly but carefully fitted an arrow      to his bowstring, aimed and let, fly. This time he hit his      mark; he was glad, because he had not eaten since the      previous day. He walked to where his arrow had fallen,      carefully removed the chocolate-covered jelly doughnut, and      walked away.</em></p><p>      <em>Jonathan V. Wright, M.D.</em>    </p>        <p>      The above fanciful passage from <em>Dr. Wright's Book of      Nutritional Therapy</em> (Rodale, 1979) makes the point      that, though our bodies and their nutritional requirements      haven't changed all that much from the time when we were      hunter-gatherers, our eating habits have changed      dramatically and recently. The refined foods that most of      us subsist on have been around for barely 100 years. That      means gardeners don't have to reach so very far back to      create a diet superior to that of the average American.      Even the act of growing your food provides an essential      vitamin - D, from sunshine. And a person can grow enough      food to supply the rest of his or her complete nutritional      needs for one year in a space of only 1,000 square feet.      Yet few of us put any real thought into the nutritional      values of the crops we grow. If we did, I imagine we'd be      surprised by our discoveries. Indeed, the crops that rate      as nutritional "superstars" aren't even raised by most      gardeners. To help you boost the health-promoting power of      your garden, we've assembled cultivation information on ten      of the all-around most healthful plants you can grow.    </p>        <h3>      <em>Sunflowers</em>    </h3>    <p>      If you read through the vitamin and mineral chart, you'll      see that sunflower seeds are a nutritional powerhouse. They      are amazingly health-promoting, but there's a hitch: The      nutritious nuggets are packaged quite well. Some folks      dehull their seeds by putting them in a blender with water      (the chopped hulls float, while the heavier seeds sink)      ...by rubbing them across a screen box made of hardware      cloth... by running them through a hand mill ...or by just      plain shelling them by hand. In truth, there is no easy way      in; build a better home-scale sunflower seed huller and the      world will beat a path to your door. Some sources will tell      you to plant sunflower seeds in warm weather, but I've seen      magnificent volunteers pop up when I was still in long      johns. You might try sowing both early and late in the      season. Full sun is a sunflower's delight, as is adequately      drained soil... though the crop will tolerate less than      ideal conditions. With little other care, the golden      monarchs will reward you with a burst of colorful bloom and      then later with large seed heads. (You may want to tie some      sort of netting loosely over these to keep birds from      eating your crop.) Sunflowers are a Native American crop -      one that was used extensively by the Indians. And based on      their food and flavor value, they're still heroes in their      own country. Mammoth Russian and Giant Single sunflowers      both have particularly high protein contents.    </p>        <h3>      <em>Millet</em>    </h3>    <p>      The ancient Hunzas and Chinese knew something most of us      don't; millet was one of the first grains to be      domesticated. And with good reason: Millet contains more of      the essential amino acids - and is more easily digested -      than wheat, rye, oats, rice or barley. Yet the only time      most Americans use millet is to feed caged birds! It's also      widely used as a livestock feed (I bought the seed I      planted from a local feed-and-seed store). Millet is      becoming more popular as food for humans, though, and can      now be purchased at food co-ops, health food stores and      even some chain groceries. Proso, or broomcorn millet, and      pearl millet (which is said to be easy to thresh) are the      varieties most used for human consumption. Pearl millet has      long, compact seed heads - the plants look a lot like      cattails-and has been grown as emergency forage on many a      farm when fall was approaching and a quick crop was needed.      (Millet will yield good livestock forage in as little as      one month.) While millet grows best in fertile ground, it's      known for its hardiness in poor soils and under dry      conditions. It's also quite disease- and pest-resistant. It      can be sowed any time from spring to early fall, depending      on the climate. You can broadcast seed onto prepared ground      and chop it in about one to three inches deep with a heavy      metal rake. Or, in a small garden, you can plant it closely      in rows. Harvest the seed heads about three months after      sowing. Be sure to get them before they're fully ripe, or      foraging birds will leave you nary a one. Tie the heads      together and hang them upside down in a dry place - inside      a bag or else loose if your storage area is free from mice.      (Does such a place exist?) You can grind the seeds finely,      hull and all, or flail or winnow them as our forebears did.      My main uses for millet have been as a breakfast cereal,      mixed with rice in stir-fried dishes and as an extender in      bread and fish loaves. There's no shortage of good recipes      for this grain in health-oriented and international      cookbooks. (And any you don't eat makes great hay or hen      feed.) So if you want to take one more step toward      nutritional self-sufficiency, try a home plot of millet.    </p>        <h3>      <em>Sesame</em>    </h3>    <p>      I saw my first sesame plant at the Blue Ridge Institute's      Farm Museum in Ferrum, Virginia, and was intrigued even      then. But after doing research for this article and      discovering sesame's high percentage of niacin, riboflavin,      thiamine, vitamin E, calcium, iron, manganese, phosphorus      and protein, I decided to grow some myself.    </p>    <p>      Sesame was smuggled into this country by African Americans,      who called it benne. It's the basis for the popular Middle      Eastern sauce and condiment tahini - which has helped      people realize sesame can be used for more than a topping      on hamburger buns. Seeds can also be added to cake. cookie      and bread recipes to boost their nutritional quality. And      there's an old tradition of making benne cakes and candy,      with sesame as the principal ingredient. A tender annual,      benne requires 70 to 110 days of full sunshine, and good      spacing (at least 12 inches) between plants for aeration.      The long taproot makes it sensitive to transplanting but      also serves as its hedge against drought. In midsummer; the      three-foot-tall plants form attractive purple-white      flowers... which eventually become small hairy pods loaded      with seed. The pods' tendency to ripen unevenly and propel      their seed in bursts makes this crop a misfit in the world      of industrial agriculture, but a fine orphan child for the      home gardener.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Dried Beans</em>    </h3>    <p>      Stamp collecting is fun, but bean collecting is fun, tasty      and nutritious. I'll admit I've been bitten by the      bean-collecting bug. How can anyone ignore a crop that's      easy to grow, harvest and store, fun to thresh, a      nitrogen-fixer and a great source of low-fat protein? Snap      and shell beans will dry if you let them, but there are      dozens of specific dried bean cultivars. Colors and      patterns abound. Names, too: Although most everyone knows      about navy, pinto, black, kidney and Great Northern beans,      how many people have heard of Lazy Wife, Gramma Walters,      Montezuma Red and Mortgage Lifter? You can grow bush or      pole varieties of many dried beans. The bush kind take less      work, but some folks swear the poles have more      flavor. Except for favas, all beans love warm weather. You      can also inoculate the seeds with rhizobium bacteria to      help the root nodules fix nitrogen in your soil.      Pre-soaking the seeds will sometimes cause them to split,      so I give them a head start by rolling them up in damp      cloths or paper towels that are then stored in plastic      bags. When the root tip (or radical) starts to protrude,      plant them tip down one to two inches under the soil,      depending on the va riety's seed size. Keep an eye out for      Mexican bean beetles - you can squash or handpick the bugs,      eggs and larvae. Better yet, interplant the beans with pota      toes; the two companions tend to repel each other's pests.      For best results, the plants should be kept generally free      from weeds and well-watered. Still, we've suc cessfully      grown several kinds of dried beans in a field that received      no irriga tion and little cultivation. Their hardiness is      impressive. As fall wears on, your beans will dry as they      stand - branch, leaf and pod. When your other harvest      chores slow a bit, pull the bean plants up and hang them to      dry further. There are various home-scale methods of      threshing them (separating the beans from their pods);      we've put them in a sack and shuffled and clogged all over      them! You can freeze the beans for a few days to kill      weevils and their eggs. Then dry them some more until you      can't dent them with your teeth. That's it. Store them in a      lidded glass jar and the colorful seeds will add to your      kitchen as well as to your diet.    </p>            <h3>      The Sunflower Wall    </h3>    <p>      Sunflowers have uses other than nutritional. A more      beautiful windbreak couldn't be built. Planted thickly,      sunflowers can provide a wind-pollination barricade between      crops. The leaves can be used as cattle feed and the dried      stems as cord fiber, kindling, or support poles for next      year's peas. The heads make lovely table centerpieces and      good squirrel feeders, and - of course - serve as a very      effective way to lure birds to the garden.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Soybeans</em>    </h3>    <p>      Of course, soybeans are the nutritional king of the dried      beans-high in protein, calcium and vitamins. We discuss      their cultivation elsewhere in this issue (see " The Most      Important Food in the World ").    </p>    	<h3>			<em>Peanuts</em>	</h3>	    <p>      Native to Peru, these nutritional legumes are used to      climates with 120 days of frost-free, sunny weather. Now,      many of you will read that sentence and want to skip over      to the next crop, but wait: There are peanut varieties that      do well even in Canada! How so? Because while the nuts need      warm soil for germination, the plants can survive light      spring and fall frosts without suffering harm. Any peanuts      you plant must be raw, with the skin around each seed still      intact. You can plant them in or out of the shell. Since      soaking them overnight in warm water helps them get off to      a quicker start, "shell planters" may want to crack those      coverings a bit and then soak their nuts, shell and all. If      you live in a warm area, you can sow your crop directly      into the garden after your last spring frost date. Folks in      cooler climes can try starting peanuts indoors four to six      weeks earlier. Use large pots - say, old paper milk cartons      for this; the roots don't like to be disturbed. And space      your plants about 18 inches apart. After the plants flower,      they'll produce pegs that grow down into the soil and then      form the goobers. So be sure to raise your crop in loose      soil. (Peanuts don't, however, need a lot of extra soil      nutrients.) You can even hill up the soil some around the      plants to help the runners meet the ground that much      sooner.    </p>    <p>      About 60 to 80 days after the pegs submerge, start checking      your hidden nuts. When ripe, they should be deep pink - not      pale pink or milky - with well-indented hulls. The plant      leaves themselves will start to pale as the crop matures.      It's a rare crop that grows up out of the ground only to      return to it. Why not match peanuts' novel perseverance      yourself? Give goober raising a try!    </p>    <h3>      <em>DGLVS</em>    </h3>    <p>      Almost all the dark green leafy vegetables (DGLVs) are      nutrient-rich. However, spinach, beet greens and Swiss      chard are also high in oxalic acid, which inhibits the      body's full use of their calcium. For that reason, I'm      going to bounce them from the "nutritional superstar"      category and focus on four other - perhaps less appreciated      - DGLVs: turnip greens, broccoli leaves, kale and parsley.    </p>        <h3>      <em>Turnip Greens</em>    </h3>    <p>      If you've been har vesting turnip roots and composting the      tops, you've been throwing good nutrition away: the leaves      are rich in vitamins A, C and calcium. Raising turnips      (beets, too) is growing two crops in one.    </p>    <p>      I broadcast seed onto a prepared bed, being careful not to      oversow. As leaves first appear, I thin them for use in      salads, soups and stews. When the roots start crowding, I      pull whole plants, often feeding the small globes to      rabbits or chickens. Soon the remaining plants stretch      their stems and the leaves get to be about six inches      across. Then it's a snap to pick enough outer fronds for a      meal, while leaving plenty of foliage to feed the plant      roots. What could be easier?    </p>    	<h3>		<em>Broccoli Leaves</em>		</h3>    <p>      Seems like most everybody knows how to grow broccoli, but      few people realize that, like turnips, it's a multiple-use      crop. Peeled and chopped stems are excellent stir-fried,      and the leaves, make perfectly good cooked greens. Those      fronds contain 16,000 IU (international units) of vitamin A      per cup (three times the RDA). In fact, they're better for      you than the plant heads are!    </p>    <p>      There's certainly more justification for the space broccoli      takes in your garden if you use all its parts.    </p>	<h3>			<em>Kale</em>		</h3>    <p>      Kale's attractive greenery packs over ten times the vitamin      A as the same amount of iceberg lettuce, has more vitamin C      per weight than orange juice, and provides more calcium      than equivalent amounts of cow's milk. It can be grown from      Florida to Alaska with very little effort-it seems to      thrive on neglect.    </p>    <p>      Like most members of the brassica family, kale is descended      from sea cab bage, from whence it got those waxy,      moisture-conserving leaves. It's a biennial, storing food      the first year to help it produce the next year's seeds      (that's why those first year leaves are so nutritious). And      it's quite frost-hardy, lasting through winter in many      locations - even under snow - to produce a second growth      come spring.    </p>        <p>      To plant kale, prepare your soil, broadcast the seed and      chop it in with a heavy metal garden rake. If conditions      are particularly dry, you might sprinkle a thin layer of      straw on top to conserve moisture. Kale grows best when      mixed with organic matter and perhaps some lime in the      soil. Plants thrive when thinned to about six inches apart      and exposed to cool temperatures.    </p>    <p>      Young tender leaves are a delicacy. I chop them raw in      salads or steam them as greens. But they achieve their peak      flavor after the first frost. The clas sic Southern way to      serve cooked greens is with chopped onions and a bit of      vinegar, a sour-sounding but surprisingly sweet-tasting      combination. The widely available Blue Scotch variety is      high in vitamin A.    </p>    <h3>      <em>Parsley</em>    </h3>    <p>      That curled decoration on your dinner plate is actually one      of the meal's most nutritious ingredients. If you're smart      enough to eat those two sprigs of garnish, you'll be      getting your RDA of both vitamins A and C.    </p>        <p>      While parsley can be started indoors, I start mine in April      by soaking the seeds overnight in warm water (this      slow-starting crop needs all the germinating help it can      get!), sowing them directly onto a prepared bed and then      sifting a fine layer of good soil over the top. A light      covering of straw helps keep the soil moist during that      long wait for germination. As the season winds on, that      skimpy stand of wispy seedlings becomes a thick patch of      deep green beauty. Parsley loves sunshine, but if you're in      a climate with intense summer heat, you should grow it      under the shade of some taller plants to help it retain      moisture. The mature sprigs are quite cold-hardy and -      along with sprouts - will bring life and greens to your      winter kitchen.    </p>    <p>      So there you have ten health-giving heroes of the garden.      Some are a bit exotic; and others have probably already      been growing, unappreciated, right under your nose. All can      help to make vegetable gardening better for you than it's      ever been before.    </p>
