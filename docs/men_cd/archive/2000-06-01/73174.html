                    <p>      <strong>Finding treasure among<br />      the wreckage.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Sally Sheklow    </h5>             <p>      I bring all of this up because I finally harvested my worm      bin. Talk about a dichotomy of hope and despair. It all      started last summer when I took home my blue plastic box      with its white smiley cartoon worm saying "Feed me garbage"      painted on the side. I envisioned myself soon scooping out      copious mounds of dark rich worm castings, just like the      stuff garden stores sell for $13.99 a bag. Tie some up with      a colorful ribbon and - presto - no more holiday gift      worries.    </p>    <p>      I did my best, initially, to follow the vermiculture creed,      feeding my red wigglers measured portions of their favorite      kitchen scraps and layering in just the right amount of      carefully torn soy-ink newspaper strips for bedding. I      dutifully mist-moistened the paper with filtered water and      shielded the worm bin from harsh sunlight. This mandated      wormfeeding regimen was tougher than Weight Watchers.    </p>    <p>      Predictably, after weeks of strictly restrained input and      meticulous record keeping, my discipline gave way. I fed      more than the prescribed amount of wilted greens. I gave my      worms a whole spoiled cantaloupe. Instead of walking my      sinkside scrap tub out to the compost heap, I dumped it all      into the vermiculture bin, wantonly disregarding the      instructions to sort out citrus rinds, avocado pits and      onions. I essentially put the worms on a binge diet.    </p>    <p>      Apparently vermiculture is a more exacting science.    </p>    <p>      Months past schedule, on a damp, gray day, I carried the      bin outside to collect my hard-won worm castings. Eager to      run my fingers through the promised loot, I spread out      newspaper and overturned the contents. My heart sank.      Dashed were my visions of abundant sweet dark castings.      Clearly, there would be no gift bags of "gardener's gold"      for the holidays. To my dis may, out poured a slimy mass of      rotting food and pale wads of decomposing worms. In that      instant, I believe I discovered what is meant by the stench      of death.    </p>    <p>      When the air cleared, I pulled up my portable gardening      bench and took a closer look. Gently spreading the goop      with my trowel, I started searching for survivors. Like a      rescuer patrolling the icy waters where the      <em>Titanic</em> sank, I watched carefully for any movement      and began lifting near-lifeless bodies from the wreckage.      Here a wiggle, there a squirm. As each little clinger to      worm life made itself noticed, I hoisted it up to safety. I      tenderly placed the barely living on a soft dry bed of      shredded newspaper. I muttered my solemn promise to all      wormkind that from that day forward I would faithfully obey      the hallowed rules of vermiculture.    </p>    <p>      I must have looked absolutely pitiful sitting there in the      cold, tearfully salvaging worm life, because my noble mate      gave up the coziness of our sofa to come outside and      console me with sweetness. There it was - my reason to      treasure even that difficult day.    </p>
