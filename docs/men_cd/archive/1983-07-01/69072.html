                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mary B. Bowling    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Is your garden plagued with 50 kinds of bugs? Then you      need amphibian insect control!</em>    </p>        <p>      The dog may be "man's best friend" . but if that person is      a gardener, his or her most treasured <em>ally is</em>      likely to be the humble toad! Warty-skinned, dumpy, and      lethargic, the jewel-eyed toad is a prodigious consumer of      just about anything that moves and will fit in its mouth.      Although most of its prey falls into the category we label      "pests" (toads love cutworms!), some of the toad's diet      does consist of such beneficial creatures as bees,      ladybugs, and lacewings. This is unfortunate, but it's      surely forgivable for a little animal that can snap up      nearly 100 insects every single night . . . a total of      nearly 10,000 bugs over a three month growing season!      Beetles of every description, caterpillars, flies, larvae,      moths, and wireworms are all fair game for this      insectivore. (It likes slugs and snails, too.) The amount      that an individual toad may consume in a single feeding is      astonishing. One toad was observed to eat 86 houseflies . .      . another ate 65 gypsy moth larvae . . . while still      another swallowed 37 adult tent caterpillars!<br />      <br />      It's pretty obvious, then, that a biological bug control of      such talent and efficiency should not be ignored. Indeed,      the savvy modern gardener would do well to      <em>cultivate</em> this little amphibian's      acquaintance.      </p>      <h3>TOADS FOR ALL REGIONS</h3>     <p>      Eighteen species of true toads live in this country, with      at least a few kinds to be found in every state in the      union (yes, even in Alaska!). They're particularly abundant      in the eastern and Gulf states and the Mississippi Valley      region . . . but in truth, they fill many different      environmental niches and can be found in every sort of      habitat from high mountains to rain forests to coastal      plains to deserts.<br />      <br />      Although similar, toads and frogs are easily distinguished.      Mature toads are dry, bumpy skinned, brownish, plump,      deliberate in their movements, and look rather pompous.      They hop-slowly-and may puff themselves up to discourage      unwelcome attention. Frogs, on the other hand, are moist      and smooth-skinned, greenish, slender, a bit dandified in      appearance, and alert. They leap-often with a total      disregard for the consequences-and usually try to escape      rather than bluff would-be captors.<br />      </p>      <h3>TO CATCH A TOAD</h3>     <p>      If your garden needs a toad patrol, it's easy (during the      appropriate season) to transplant eggs, tadpoles, toad      lets, or adults from their native habitats to your yard. Of      course, mature toads can be caught during any warm month .      . . beginning along about March or April. Then you're      likely to hear the evening chorus of long, high-pitched      trills or discordant nasal croaks signaling that      hoppers-such as the adult American toad <em>(Bufo      americanus) or</em> Fowler's toad <em>(Bufo woodlouse      fowleri),</em> two of the most common species in the United      States-have left their winter burrows and are congregating      around water to find. mates. You can track down these      mature specimens with a flashlight (they rarely run from      the beam), quietly following their voices until you 1ocate      them. They can then be apprehended with a net, a bucket, a      bag, a box, or even your bare hands . . . but be      forewarned! When you grab a toad, it may chirp, shriek,      urinate, and/or exude a gooey, caustic fluid from the      glands behind its "eye bulges". It may also appear to play      dead, although many scientists think the creatures aren't      faking but are actually frightened into unconsciousness.      None of these natural defenses will harm you, but you      should wash your hands promptly and thoroughly afterward,      as the glandular secretion can irritate mucous membranes      such as those in the mouth or eyes. (The goo <em>won't</em>      cause warts!)<br />      <br />      Eggs are laid in shallow water that is slow moving or      still. They're deposited in long, coiling tubes of jelly,      each of which contains a single row of small, black ova.      (Frog eggs are also black, but are laid in clusters, with      each embryo encased in its own round capsule of jelly.)      Carefully scoop the fragile tubes into a bucket . . . along      with some of the surrounding water, a few algae-covered      stones or some green pond scum, and bits of water plants      for the tadpoles to eat when they emerge in 3 to 12      days.<br />      <br />      If you can't find any eggs, look for <em>tadpoles.</em>      Toad tads are small, very dark brown or black, and may have      minute gold stipples on their oval, short-tailed bodies. At      this stage, toads can best be distinguished from frogs by      color: Most frog tadpoles are <em>not</em> black. Capture      the little wrigglers just as you would the eggs.<br />      <br />      To hold down the mortality rate, don't crowd your catch: No      more than a dozen should be kept in a one- to two-gallon      container. A spare string of eggs in a separate jar can be      used to replace any eggs that die or become diseased (if      they turn white, they should be removed at once). Because      the eggs and tadpoles are susceptible to overheating, be      sure never to leave them in direct sunlight for an entire      day. In addition, every week or so, place a few more      algae-covered rocks and bits of waterweed in the toad      nursery for food. And keep an eye on the water level . . .      as the liquid evaporates, replace it with more pond      water.<br />      <br />      In SO to 65 days-usually around late June or July-the      babies will develop into tiny <em>toadlets</em> that look      like smooth-skinned miniature adults. The youngsters crawl      onto land and hide in nearby vegetation for a few days.      Then, with the first rain shower or cloudy, humid day, they      migrate-sometimes in droves!-to the fields and gardens.      Those animals that survive grow quickly, shedding their      skins every few weeks . .. and reach adult size in about a      year.<br />      <br />      Once on land, toads require a cool, damp place to live.      Unless you have an unusually wet plot, you'll need to add a      small pond of sorts so that your garden guardian will be      healthy and contented. An old dishpan buried to the rim      will serve quite well when filled with water and given      several fist-sized rocks that protrude above the surface.      Toads are territorial and are loners by nature, so if you      want more than one hopper in your garden you should set up      several small, scattered puddles rather than one large      pool. Beyond that, you'll need some good-sized rocks,      broken flowerpots, or a length of log <em>next</em> to each      little pond to provide shade and an attractive place for      the animal to burrow.<br />      </p>      <h3>THE FRIENDLY AMPHIBIAN</h3>      <p>      Toads usually live in a small area and return to a favorite      spot each evening to feed. It may come as a surprise to you      that they are the most intelligent of the amphibians, but      it's true: They can be taught to come out of hiding when      called and to accept food from humans. In fact, if feeding      is done on a regular schedule, many toads even anticipate      their dinner! (They eat only moving prey, so proffered      delicacies should be waved in front of them on the end of a      twig.) Furthermore, the bug hunters respond to the "soft      touch". Once accustomed to gentle handling, a toad will      settle serenely in your opened palm, often stretching out      one hind leg at a time to have it stroked and      scratched.<br />      <br />      Although eggs and tadpoles require a bit of nurturing,      adult toads need only to have their ponds refilled during      dry spells. In return, they will provide the gardener with      many years of faithful service in biological insect control      and the pleasure of animal companionship. No one's yet      determined the toad's life expectancy in the wild, but      these little amphibians have been known to live in      captivity for more than 30 years. With so much offered for      so little effort, don't wait to get a toad for your garden:      <em>Hop to it!:</em>    </p>    <hr />
