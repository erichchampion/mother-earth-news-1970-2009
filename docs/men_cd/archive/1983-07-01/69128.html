                    <hr />            <h5 id="byline">        By Peter Hemingson      </h5>      <p>        Summer's sun shimmers. Baked in heat, you sucker tomatoes        . . . handpick bean beetles . . . weed by fall crop        shoots . . . and side-dress budding peppers. The first        drops of a thundershower hiss as they strike shingle and        asphalt.<br />        <br />        Toil till the storm bursts full force . . . then sprint        for cover, find a cool spot, and feed your mind with a        good garden book.<br />        <br />        Imagine a docile insect whose sole aim in life seems to        be pollinating fruit trees .. . and which does so almost        80 times as efficiently as the common honeybee Well,        you've just conjured up a mental image of an important        Insect recently introduced from Japan: the horn faced        bee. Dr. Suzanne Batra, of the USDA Beneficial Insect        Introduction Laboratory at Beltsville, Maryland, has been        studying the little critters for several years . .. and        her enthusiasm for their ability as pollinators is        boundless. It seems that the horn faced bee loves the        nectar and pollen of fruit trees (peaches, plums, pears,        and especially-apples), while the common honeybee often        would rather visit a dandelion than the pink and white        blossoms of a McIntosh. Horn faced bees are not honey        producers, but they seem perfectly designed for their        role as pollinators. They emerge from winter dormancy        when the cherry trees bloom ... mate, lay eggs, and        collect nectar and pollen-with a passion-for four to six        weeks . . . and then die! All summer long, the new larvae        prow inside the reeds (or cardboard tubes) the insect        uses as a nest. Shortly after this next generation        evolves into adults in the late summer or early fall, the        bees still in the nests) become dormant, remaining quiet        all winter long. (The bees have a freezing requirement        similar to that of hardy plants.) Finally, in the spring        as the cherries bloom again-the little insects emerge and        go to work.<br />      </p>      <h3>        HELP FROM MOTHER'S READERS      </h3>      <p>        A good deal has been learned about the horn faced bee,        but additional information concerning their adaptation to        differing climates is still needed. Dr. Batra would like        to give small colonies of the insects to some of MOTHER's        readers ... those who meet certain requirements and who        would agree to report back on their successes (or        failures). She's Interested in folks who (1) are organic        growers (sprays -especially Serving, but others as        well-devastate the bee colonies) . . . (2) have fruit        tree orchards ranging in size from a couple of trees to        several acres . .. and (3) have kept bees In the past, or        are familiar with beekeeping. If you'd like to receive a        colony of horned bees, drop a postcard to Dr. Suzanne        Batra, Beneficial Insect Introduction Laboratory, Dept.        TMEN, Building 417, USDA-BARCE, Beltsville, Maryland        20705. Mention the size and kind of your orchard, and        give information on your beekeeping experience. Also,        describe your climate: Horned bees thrive in the moisture        of the eastern half of the country as well as the coastal        Pacific Northwest, but are unsuited to the dry western        states. This fall, Dr. Batra will contact the readers she        has chosen to participate in her experiment, and dormant        bees will be shipped in late fall or winter. And don't be        disappointed if you're not selected: The people at        Beltsville will be using the list Dr. Batra compiles to        seek out test sites for other experiments, too. If you        are fortunate enough to flat some bees, though, prepare        to bet a bumper crop of apples!      </p>      <h3>        BARC STRIPPED?      </h3>      <p>        If Dr. Batra's horned bees captured your interest, or if        you're concerned as to whether Dr. Robert Schroder's work        on natural controls for the Colorado potato beetle will        continue unimpeded, or if you want to make sure that        Howard Kerr's innovative (and enormously important) small        farm program will retain access to scientific personnel        of all disciplines, it's time to make your wishes known!        According to Science magazine, a major shift in        administration policy on public lands may threaten the        continued existence of this nation's Beltsville        Agricultural Research Center (BARC) in Maryland. It seems        that the sale of at least some of Beltsville's "surplus"        acreage is being contemplated by the General Services        Administration as a device to reduce the national debt .        . . a highly questionable means to a rather improbable        goal. While the immediate threat is to just past of the        center, many people are of the opinion that GSA will chip        away at the facility until BARC's very existence is no        longer justified.<br />        Of course, if the widely respected center is to be turned        into acres of suburban condominiums (BARC is currently        one of the few greenbelt areas in the suburbs north of        Washington, D.C.), it would take years to reestablish        elsewhere the experiments already in progress at BARC.        Worse yet, the invaluable cross fertilization of        scientific disciplines now occurring would be lost        altogether. And it's practically a certainty that the        programs for small and organic growers would "fall        between the cracks" with Beltsville's demise.<br />        BARC's preservation is vital to all of us, since we all        benefit from the basic research conducted there. To help        preserve the Beltsville Agricultural Research Center,        write to your Representative, suggesting support of Rep.        Steny Hoyer's bill (HR 1688) . . . to your Senators, in        support of S 423, which was introduced by Senators        Mathias and Sarbanes . . . and to the General Services        Administration's Federal Property Resources Service        (Dept. TMEN, 18th and F Streets N.W., Washington, D.C.        20405), requesting that <em>none</em> of Beltsville's        land be declared surplus.      </p>      <h3>        WHO DO?ZOODOO!      </h3>      <p>        One of the most unusual (as well as catchily named) soil        amendments I've run across is being test-marketed by the        Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, a community        development group in New York's poverty-shocked South        Bronx. ZooDoo is a wholly organic soil-enricher made from        composted leaves, straw bedding, and (ready for this?)        manure from herbivores at the famous Bronx Zoo. Jack        Flanagan, president of Bronx Frontier (he quit his police        officer's job in New York's 41st Precinct-"Fort        Apache"-to help the community by starting a gardening        program), claims that the compost is terrific fertilizer.        If you'd like to put an elephant in your eggplant,        information on availability (so far, just in the New York        area . . . including Blooming dales!) of the product and        details about the composting program can be obtained from        The Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, Dept. TMEN,        1080 Leggett Avenue, The Bronx, New York 10474.      </p>      <h3>        MUSHROOMING INTEREST      </h3>      <p>        Rejoice, you friends of fungi! These days, an increasing        number of mushroom-growing kits are becoming available .        . . and in the not-too-distant future, you should be able        to cultivate some of the more exotic (and flavorful)        fungi.<br />        <br />        <em>You're probably already familiar with the kits for        growing Agaricus bisporus, the common button mushroom . .        . they're shown in many seed catalogs. Now, several of        those mail order firms also offer setups that allow you        to sample the pleasures of growing the oriental Shiitake        mushroom,</em> Lentinus edodes. Most <em>of these kits        will produce about a pound or two of the delectable        fungi, but if you've developed a fondness for Shiitake,        you'll want to move up to growing larger quantities.        Enter firms<br /></em><br />        <em>such as Bob Harris's and Jennifer Snyder's Mushroom        people (Dept.</em> <em>TMEN, P.O. Box 158, Inverness,        California 94937). These folks offer a bag of Shiitake        mushroom spawn plugs enough to inoculate 20 to 50 logs        that are one to three feet long-for $15, postpaid.        (Discount prices are available with larger orders.) You        can figure on harvesting between 1-112 and 3 pounds of        tasty fungi per log . . . which (at the wholesale price        of $3.OC per pound) means you'll have at least $90 worth        of mushrooms! Bob has also developed a method that        shortens the growing period from two years to as short a        time as four months. You can find out about that process        in his nicely illustrated pamphlet called "S hiitake        Gardening" ($3.00, postpaid).<br /></em> <em>Meanwhile,        in Texas a<br /></em><br />        <em>transplanted Frenchman is starting up the American        truffle industry. Yes, the "black diamonds" (so prized by        gourmets that the fungi sell for as much as $500 a</em>        pound!) <em>have finally been cultivated . . . although        the seven-year crop has so far fruited only in France.        Frangois Picart, formerly a snail grower, has established        Agri-Truffle . . . a company devoted to marketing oak and        filbert seedlings whose roots have been mycorrhized by        the spore of Tuber melanosporum, the black truffle. In        order to thrive, the delicious fungi require a        well-drained, calcareous soil with a pH above 7.2.        Organic matter should be low between 2% and 8%-and the        climate mild, With the soil freezing no deeper than three        inches. Currently, inoculated seedlings (in minimum lots        of ten) cost about $14 each from AgriTruffle (Dept. TMEN,        Star Route 1A, Box 45A, Dripping Springs, Texas 78620) or        $12 apiece<br /></em><br />        <em>from Mushroom people. Since no truffles have fruited        in this country yet, though, it might not be a bad idea        to send for an introductory packet ($2.00 postpaid from        Agri-Truffle) before you order any "trees". This        informative kit even tells how to train pigs (or-less        colorfully dogs) to sniff out the earthy gems!<br /></em>        <em>Also tantalizingly just over the horizon is the        prospect of cultivated morels, to my way of thinking        among the most delicious mushrooms. (If I sound a bit        smug, I am: The fungi grow by serendipity under my apple        trees,) In 1981, Ronald Power reported success in        cultivating morels . . . and his claim has been validated        by a team of mycologists at Michigan State University.        Commercial spore production is a few years away, but the        possibility alone should be enough to make true        morel-lovers smack their lips in anticipation.</em>      </p>      <h3>        READING FOR A SUMMER DAY      </h3>            <p>        A number of splendid garden books have piled up since we        last had a chance to <em>talk about our body of growing        information. Several titles have arrived from</em> HP        <em>Books (all are available for the list price plus        $1.00 for shipping and</em> handling from HP <em>Books,        Dept.</em> TMEN, P.O. <em>Box 5367, Tucson, Arizona        85703). The one I</em> found most <em>immediately useful        is the superb Pruning by Dr.</em> Robert Stebbins and        Michael MacCaskey. Loaded with color photographs and        <em>crammed with line drawings, this</em> informative        volume <em>covers</em> ornamental <em>and</em> fruit        trees <em>along with shrubs and roses.</em> In        <em>clear,</em> non technical language <em>the authors        tell you how</em> (and <em>why) to prune for beauty,</em>        fullness, and <em>proper growth. They also treat</em>        remedial pruning <em>as</em> well <em>as</em> I've        <em>ev</em> <em>er seen it</em> done. <em>The price is        $7.95. Other</em> recent HP <em>titles, all profusely        illustrated and</em> meeting the <em>high standards of        the series, include Bulbs ($7.95) . . . Spas & Hot        Tubs ($7.95) . . . Hedges, Screens and Espaliers ($9.95)        . . . Fences, Gates and Walls ($9.95) . . . and Patios        & Decks ($9.95). There wasn't</em> one I didn't like.      </p>            <p>        If you missed the delightful (and very useful) series of        gardening annuals <em>published by Yankee magazine over        the last few years, you've got a</em> second chance. A        selection of <em>the best material from that series has        now been brought together</em> under the <em>title The        Gardener's Adviser ($8.95 at</em> most bookstores). It's        a thoroughly enjoyable collection. Two other tomes at the        top of my list come from Garden Way. The first is Dick        Raymond's gorgeous Joy of <em>Garden</em> ing ($14.95),        which matches the high quality of Raymond's previous        works and is a companion to that master gardener's        television series. The second work is Roses Love Garlic        ($6.95), Louise Riotte's sequel to her well-known Carrots        Love Tomatoes ($6.95). The work is laid out di        ctionary-style and has some unique features, including a        chapter titled<br />        <br />        "Night Bloomers for Daytime Workers" (welcome to those        who usually get to see their gardens only on weekends!).        All three volumes are available from Mother's Bookshelf's        (105 Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina        28791) for their list prices plus $1.25 shipping and        handling for one or two books ($2.00 for three or        more).<br />        <br />        Finally, it's a pleasure to report that The Avant        <em>Gardener,</em> that essential horticultural        newsletter, has published a special supplement on        integrated pest management. The eight-page report is        available for $1.50 postpaid from The Avant <em>Gardener,        Dept</em> . TMEN, P.O. Box 489, New York, New York 10028.        They'll include a free sample copy of the regular        newsletter with each order.      </p>    <hr />
