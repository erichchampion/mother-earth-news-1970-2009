                    <h5 id="byline">      By Tim Matson    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>When designing</em> <em>the perfect pier</em> <em>for      your pond,</em> <em>there are a</em> <em>number of</em>      <em>reasons why you</em> <em>might want to</em> <em>build .      . .</em>    </p>        <p>      For years, I've had an itch to put a mini wharf in my pond,      but I was stymied by what seemed to be a simple question:      Where should I put it? For example, in a small (one-eighth      acre) body of water like mine, a pier moored in a fixed      spot along a shallow shore might be great for children,      sunbathers, or ice skaters . . . but what about the      structure's disadvantages?<br />      <br />      Mounting a dock permanently can be tricky in ponds where      the water level bobs up and down according to the rainfall.      One that's well suited for diving in April may be high and      dry by July! Then too, a dock is a perfect place to lash a      cage full of fish being fattened for the table, since it      offers easy access for stocking, feeding, and harvesting.      Cage culture, however, is also better suited to moderately      deep water, where the temperatures stay cooler and the      habitat is protected against drought. But come winter, when      the harvest is over and it's time for ice hockey, who wants      a dock jutting into the rink? What's more, after a few      years of relentless freezing and thawing wracking the      pilings out of kilter, a conventionally moored dock just      might shove off on its own! And finally, the pond keeper      who anticipates touch up shoreline excavation or dredging      doesn't need a dock in the way when he or she is making      repairs.<br />      </p>      <h3>A SOLUTION IN SIGHT</h3>     <p>      Fretting over all these considerations caused me to      continually <em>postpone</em> the construction of my      mini-pier . . . at least, until the day I got a look at the      rolling dock in Donny Prescott's pond over on the other      side of the mountain. It was the first one I'd seen that      was not encumbered by those old-fashioned hang ups:      pilings.<br />      <br />      Instead, the shore bound end of Donny's dock perches on his      dam, while the water bound end rests on a pair of old metal      wheels submerged where their height balances out the      basin's slope. The result is a sturdy, level,      <em>portable</em> dock.<br />      <br />      Donny told me that he built his unique pier out of a pair      of 12-foot 2 X 6's (to serve as the carrying timbers) . . .      one-inch planking . . . and the axle and wheels from an old      discarded side-delivery hay-rake. After dismantling the      rake, he trucked the axle and wheels to the pond, mounted      one end of each of the carrying timbers to the axle, and      nailed down the planks.<br />      <br />      His creation-which can be rolled around to fit the season      (and use), positioned to match water levels, or taken out      of the pond entirely was such a successful solution to my      quandary that I asked him for tips on building a movable      dock for myself.<br />      <br />      "I'd try to match the radius of the wheels with the slope      of the pond basin," he told me. "The deeper you want to go,      the bigger the wheels you'll need . . . so locate your axle      and wheels first.<br />      <br />      "And remember," he added, "you can roll the dock in only as      deep as the axle. If you need to extend the carrying      timbers beyond the wheels to get out farther into the      water, you might have to stake down or cantilever the shore      end, to prevent the whole thing from acting like a seesaw.      Just keep a lookout for old farm machinery . . . get the      axle and wheels that are suitable for your pond's size . .      . and then build the dock to fit your needs."<br />      <br />      Know what? That's exactly what I'm going to do!    </p>    <hr />
