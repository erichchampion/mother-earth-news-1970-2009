                    <h5 id="byline">      by Kelly Farrens    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>You don't have to eat this root crop "boiled, boiled,      or boiled"; not if you boldly . ..</em><br />      <br />      Turnips are a boon to the self-reliant gardener. The leaves      are vitamin-packed and delicious, and the mineral-rich      roots can easily be stored over the winter in a cool      basement or root cellar. (Just cut the tops off to within      half an inch of the roots and sink the turnips into boxes      filled with either moist sand or sawdust.)<br />      <br />      Sad to say, though, Brassica rapa does have an "image      problem": Few root crops are as devoid of glamour as the      lowly turnip. While its garden mate the potato can end up      in such high-class dishes as vichyssoise, and carrots even      make it into cake . . . the turnip is usually served boiled      or maybe-on special occasions-mashed. Recently, however,      O.W. "Ott" Bogner of Crofton, Nebraska, a man who knows a      lot about food preparation (he owned a steakhouse and      lounge for 37 years), taught me a whole <em>new</em> way to      process this vegetable . . . making turnip kraut!    </p>          <h3>SAUER RUBEN</h3>      <p>      "A Kentucky friend gave me this recipe a number of years      ago," Ott says, "and I've been enjoying it ever since. In      fact, that same friend constructed a dandy turnip shredder      for me-one that gives me spaghetti-like strips-but you can      use any kitchen tool with a shredding blade to prepare the      roots."<br />      <br />      First, Ott peels the turnips with an ordinary paring knife.      Then he centers each root on his shredder and turns the      handle ... and the blades cut the vegetable into long,      continuous strings that spiral down into a clean washtub.      Bogner puts these strips into quart canning jars.<br />      <br />      "I prefer the wide-mouth type," he told me, "because      they're easier to fill."<br />      <br />      That done, the krautmaker cuts the turnip strings level      with the top of each jar and adds one heaping teaspoon of      pickling salt to every quart. Next, he fills the containers      with hot tap water and puts the lids on loosely, so that      the kraut can ferment. When the fixings are kept in a warm      place (ideally 68° to 70°F), their "working" period      lasts about six weeks,<br />     </p>      <h3>FINISHING UP</h3>     <p>      After the aging process is complete, the former      restaurateur adds enough hot water to refill the jars and      puts the lids on . . . tightly this time. He then places      the containers in a water-bath canner and brings the water      to a full boil for 20 minutes.<br />      <br />      "This is to insure proper sealing," Ott explains.<br />      <br />      He also lets the jars remain in the canner to cool after      the heat is turned off.<br />      <br />      The result?<br />      <br />      "Well, it does taste different from regular sauerkraut,"      laughs the good-natured gourmet. "I like it for a change of      pace . . . particularly served with ribs, hocks, or-best of      all-pigs' feet. In fact, I think turnip kraut's great!"    </p>    <hr />
