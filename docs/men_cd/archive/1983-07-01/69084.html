                			<h2 id="subtitle">IT PAYS TO ADVERTISE!)</h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Don Vandeventer    </h5>        <hr />    <p>      <em>Promoting</em> other <em>people's bootstrap efforts can      be profitable for both them</em> and you!<br />      <br />      A few years back, my friend Paula Vineyard and I decided to      venture to our own home busi ness. When we looked into      advertising the product we hoped to sell, though, my      partner and I were amazed at the high costs involved.      Expensive radio or television commercials were out of the      question for us. So we checked into the possibility of a      Yellow Pages listing . . . and discovered that (in our      area, at least) the cost for the <em>smallest</em> entry      was about $45 per month. One last bastion of hope was the      community's daily newspaper. We investigated that avenue      and sadly found that a 1 "X 2" display ad cost $14 for each      insertion.<br />      <br />      At that price it wouldn't take very long to deplete our      entire advertising budget! In desperation, Paula and I did      the only thing we could. We printed business cards, and      left them posted on bulletin boards throughout the area.      Then we resigned ourselves to sitting back and crossing our      fingers . . . hoping our customers would manage to find      us.<br />      </p>      <h3>SOLVING THE HOME BUSINESS DILEMMA</h3>     <p>      Sadly, during the winter of 1981-1982 our sales reached a      dangerously low level, and we had to fold. My partner and I      closed our endeavor on Friday, February 19, 1982 with      exactly $14.60 in the company checking account. We had no      jobs or business prospects. The future looked bleak.<br />      <br />      Paula and I began brainstorming for new ideas almost      immediately. Yet every enterprise we thought of seemed      doomed to failure because of high start-up and promotional      costs. It was then that we began to visualize a home      business directory. After all, we had learned (the hard      way) that most self-run enterprises simply cannot afford      conventional advertising. So, we asked ourselves, why not      come up with an effective solution to that problem . . .      and <em>capitalize</em> on it?<br />      <br />      We phoned our self-employed friends and acquaintances and      asked whether they'd be interested in participating in a      directory of home-based businesses. Almost everyone we      talked with was enthusiastic about the project, so Paula      and I sunk our last $14.60 in a small classified      advertisement for the local newspaper to seek out other      potential advertisers ... and raced forward from      there.<br />      <br />      Well, it's been more than a year now since we printed and      distributed our first Home Business Directory. In that time      we've produced several such guides-covering four counties      in northern Illinois -and are both making full-time incomes      from our endeavor!<br />      </p>      <h3>YOU CAN DO IT, TOO!</h3>     <p>      According to the Small Business Administration, the number      of home-operated U.S. enterprises is on the rise. Ten years      ago, there were only 2.5 million such businesses . . .      today there are nearly 5 million . . . and estimates      indicate that in another ten years there will be 10      million. With such a growing number of run-it-yourself      operations springing up in this country, publishing      home-based business directories can provide you with an      excellent part time-or eventually full-time income.<br />      <br />      Exactly how much money are we talking about? Well, let's      look at some conservative figures. If you live in an area      with at least 35,000 people, draw 200 advertisers for your      guide, and work 20 hours a week (over a period of four      months), you should be able to make $2,500 profit from one      directory. Cover larger areas, publish more directories, or      attract more advertisers (while, of course, working more      hours), and your income will <em>rise</em> from      there!<br />      <br />      And one of the biggest advantages of this income      opportunity is the small initial investment. You can      virtually start "on a shoestring", since any ads you sell      are paid for as they are placed. Front money, then, is not      a major requirement of this home business. Instead, it's      much more important that you be a self-starter who likes      people and is able to organize well.<br />      </p>      <h3>POINTS TO PONDER</h3>    <p>      First of all, you must remember this: If you collect ad      money for a directory, and said directory is never      published-for <em>any</em> reason you'll have to repay      every dime to your advertisers or else you'll be in deep      trouble. (Angry advertisers and lawsuits are only      <em>some</em> of the problems you'll have to deal with.) So      be sure to finish what you start!<br />      <br />      Second, it really does take a population of at least 35,000      to support a directory. But then, you don't need to limit      yourself to just one town. Two of our publications covered      whole counties!<br />      <br />      Third-and I tell you this from experience's frightfully      easy to spend all that ad revenue as it comes in without      setting anything aside to cover the expenses of printing      and distributing the directories. To avoid that calamity,      deposit-from the very start-a minimum of <em>60%</em> of      all the money collected into a separate bank account. This      should be enough to meet all your expenses . . . with any      remainder earmarked as a bonus for a job well done.<br />      <br />      My fourth bit of advice involves you, the law, and the IRS.      You'll need to research and follow all local codes and      ordinances regarding the setting up of a home business.      (These restrictions will vary from place to place.) In      addition, keep good records for income tax purposes.<br />      <br />      And finally, you will-in all likelihood meet people who      will tell you on Monday that they want to advertise . . .      but why, when it comes to actually parting with the cash on      Friday, will experience a change of heart. Don't be      discouraged by those folk, They'll constitute a minority of      your contacts. But likewise, try not to rely heavily on      verbal agreements.<br />      </p>      <h3>HOW MUCH DO WE CHARGE?</h3>     <p>      We've found that in a small community with a population of      35,000 to 75,000, a rate of $25 for a six-line ad is      reasonable And $30 for a similar ad is a good price to      charge in more populated areas. Of course, you may discover      that an advertiser will want to publish ads under several      different categories. So, by giving a price break for      multiple entries, you may well encourage your clients to      spend more money.<br />      <br />      This is our rate schedule, which you may want to use as a      guide:    </p>        <p>      Let's suppose your targeted market are a smaller community,      and therefore each adcarries a $25 price tag. A minimum of      200 listings will yield a gross income of $5,000 and,      subsequently, a net profit of about $2,500 (printing      expenses and other costs will consume about <em>half</em>      of the total revenue you take in).<br />      </p>      <h3>DIRECTORY DESIGN</h3>      <p>      The end product can be as starkly functional or as      elaborate as you like. We use 20pound, plain white bond      paper, 8-1/2" X 11 ", folded in half, for the interior of      the directory. We print our covers on 90-pound card stock,      which is also "standard" size, folded in half. This      produces a finished book of 8-1/2" X 51/2". To bind the      pages together, we have the printer "saddle stitch" them.      (This magazine uses saddle stitch binding. However,      although THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> requires three staples in      its center spread, your directory should need only      two.)<br />      <br />      My partner and I print the name of our directory, the area      it covers, and the date of publication on the front cover.      (By the way, our title, "Home Business Directory", is      copyrighted . . . so you <em>can't</em> use it. There are a      lot of other possibilities for names, however. Be sure to      choose one that people will understand and that helps      explain the book's contents.) We use a very simple format      on the inside pages: no logos or graphics . . . just      paragraphs set in six lines, with 40 spaces in each line.      If a pica typewriter is used, this provides each advertiser      with a 1 " X 4" ad.<br />      <br />      Here's a sample ad displaying our usual format:<br />      <br />      HENSLEY'S GLASS SERVICE Phone Address City For fast,      economical service. Storm win dows, screens, doors,      mirrors, desk tops,and plexiglass. Shop work only.<br />      <br />      As you can see, the first line is the advertiser's name or      business name and the telephone number. The second line      carries the entrepreneur's address and city. You'll      probably want to place each entry under an appropriate      category (such as antiques, arts and crafts, carpentry,      child care, etc.). The ads are listed alphabetically under      suitable sections ... which are <em>also</em> arranged in      alphabetical order.<br />      <br />      We developed a form for our customers to use that has a      block of space for each letter. This takes the work out of      determining the length of the listing. We collect the money      along with the form, either through the mail or in person.      By maintaining a strict policy of no billing and no second      calls, we cut down our costs considerably.<br />      <br />      If you want your directory to look professional, you might      want to have the ad listings typeset. That extra step will      give the book an attractive appearance, but it isn't      necessary. A good typewriter (and typist!) is effective and      not <em>nearly</em> as expensive.<br />      </p>      <h3>PINPOINT PROSPECTS</h3>     <p>      Compile a list of people you know who operate home      businesses. Don't forget those "unlikely" potential      advertisers such as the neighbor who decorates cakes, the      person at church who makes wooden trays, or the cousin who      does drafting work on the side. And ask friends and      relatives to add to your list any bootstrappers they      know.<br />      <br />      Once you've exhausted your own sources, scan the local      newspapers. In Rockford, Illinois we have seven area      papers: a daily, a weekly newssheet, a union paper, two      church publications, an ethnic newsletter, and a weekly      shopper. Paula and I went through each one, marked any ad      that looked as though it might be for a home based      business, then added those advertisers to our prospects      list- It's also a good idea to check community bulletin      boards in laundries, grocery stores, cafes, lumberyards,      and hardware stores for business cards. (Consider posting      your own notice up on the board, stating that you're      compiling a directory of home-based businesses, and      requesting interested parties to call.) Finally, ask anyone      who places an ad with you for the names of <em>other</em>      potential advertisers.<br />      <br />      As a rule of thumb, roughly a <em>third of</em> the names      on your list will be inclined to buy space in your      directory. But keep all the names, and add new prospects as      you locate them. It'll prove invaluable when you compile      your next-enlarged-edition. (You should be able to publish      a directory for one area twice a year.)<br />      </p>      <h3>"WORK THE LIST"</h3>    <p>      Paula and I have used two different approaches in selling      ads for our directory. In the first community we served, we      called prospective clients on the phone and explained the      idea to them. (We learned that calling is most effectively      done between 3 p.m. and 9 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and      between 9 a.m. and noon on Ft Fridays and Saturdays.)      Whenever an owner seemed receptive, we promptly sent that      individual a form-along with price quote. and mailing      information-and followed up with another phone call if the      businessperson didn't return the listing by the stated due      date.<br />      <br />      For our second attempt my partner and I called prospective      clients on the telephone, explained our concept, and then      made an <em>appointment</em> to visit the potential      advertiser in person. During the get-together, we'd answer      questions, show a sample directory, and assist the client      in writing the ads.<br />      <br />      Both methods have advantages and disadvantages. If you're      limited in time and mobility, you'll probably elect the      first technique . . . and find it to be quite effective.      Not surprising ly, though, you'll likely achieve even      greater results if you're able to make "house calls".<br />      <br />          </p>          <h3>ASSEMBLE THE PRODUCT</h3>     <p>      Set on a specific deadline and <em>stick to it,</em> even      if it means not getting in touch with everyone on your      prospects list. If you delay publishing the directory, your      clients will be disappointed and your credibility will be      damaged. In our experience, the entire project requires a      four month timetable. It takes about three months to form      the prospects list, collect the ads, and prepare the final      copy for the printer. During the fourth month, the      publication is actually printed and distributed. So if you      plan to release a directory on May 1, you'd better start by      January 1.    </p>        <p>      After Paula and I have gathered all the ads we plan to      sell, we organize the order blanks alphabetically by      categories. Then I type up the "proof copy". The pages of      the proofs should look exactly the way you want the      finished product to appear. I make mine -one at a time-by      inserting a standard she et of typing paper      <em>sideways</em> into my typewriter, and then neatly      typing up the entries. I keep my line of type 4 inches      long, maintaining 3-1/2inch margins on either side, and      leaving 1inch gaps at the top and bottom of the      sheet.<br />      <br />      I never start an ad on a page unless it can be completed on      the same sheet. If that's not possible, but there's still      extra room at the bottom of my paper, I type in a filler      blurb (plugging the directory, naturally) to take up the      leftover space.<br />      <br />      The proof copy will indicate how many pages your book will      have. <em>Four</em> of your pages will fit on <em>one</em>      of the printer's sheets (the sheet will include two pages-a      front one and a back one-in both halves of the book), so      you'll have to give the printer a number of pages that's      divisible by four. For example, if your typed proof sheets      total 49, you'll have to go to the next multiple of four,      which is 52 pages, or 13 large printer's sheets. (You can      take up the slack by leaving a few blank sheets at the      beginning and end of the directory.)<br />      <br />      And believe me, you'd be economically prudent to take a      little extra time and shop around for a printer. Paula and      I called a great many in our area, and found a lot of      difference in quoted prices. We finally selected a man who      charged a full 2007o less than anyone else we had looked      into, and he was the <em>tenth</em> printer we'd talked      to!<br />      <br />      Naturally, you'll want to strive for the greatest possible      accuracy, so you'll have to proofread each ad carefully. We      double check the spelling of names and the numbers in      addresses and telephone listings, and usually find it      useful to compile an index of advertisers.<br />      </p>      <h3>HOW MANY DIRECTORIES?</h3>     <p>      We print at least 15 copies for every ad that's published      in the directory. For instance, if you've sold 100 ads,      you'll want to print a minimum of 1,500 copies . . . and      150 ads translates into 2,250 copies.<br />      <br />      Another good rule of thumb is this: If you live in a town      of 40,000 people, then statistically speaking-that      community has about 10,000 homes. If you print and      distribute 4,000 copies of your directory, you'll      potentially have reached more than one third of the homes      in your target area. That is considered good      coverage.<br />      </p>      <h3>DISTRIBUTION DATA</h3>     <p>      After the finished product returns from the printer, your      first concern will be getting copies to each one of your      advertisers (We also make a point to include a personalized      letter of thanks to each one.) Then bundle up packets of      the booklets, and drop them off at places that cater to      consumer, such as real estate offices, insurance agencies,      cafes, barber shops and beauty salons, laundromats, and      consignment shops. (Of course, always obtain the owner's      permission before leaving directories at any particular      outlet.)<br />      <br />      Paula and I take this idea one step lf u ether. After      letting a potential distributor -whose enterprise obviously      should <em>not</em> compete with any of those in your      guide!see the directory, we explain that we plan to run a      notice in the local newspapers announcing "guide giveaway"      points. If that proprietor wants to be listed in this      notice, we ask for a $5.00 fee and then give him or her 100      copies of the book to distribute. The money we collect from      several of these storekeepers covers the cost of the      newspaper notice! (And <em>lots</em> of people do answer      the ad and pick up a directory.)<br />      <br />      Sometimes you'll receive letters from advertisers,      distributors, and satisfied customers giving positive      comments about your service. Hang on to these, as they'll      make effective advertisements for your next directory.      (Don't ever <em>make</em> up quotes, though: That's not      ethical business behavior.)<br />      </p>      <h3>ONE FINAL WORD . . .</h3>		<p>	      Please remember that publishing a home business directory      is <em>not</em> an easy way to "get rich quick". It's hard      work and requires a great deal of organization and time.      But then, the project is <em>more</em> than just monetarily      rewarding. Paula and I are proud that our directories have      helped more than 25 new home businesses get off the ground.      In addition, we've seen others expand-sometimes from ,part-      to full-time enterprises!-because of the business generated      by our efforts. Thus we've made a difference in the lives      of our customers. We like knowing that. And, as is so often      the case, by helping others we've enjoyed the benefits of      extra income <em>and</em> respect in the communities we      serve.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Paula Vineyard and Don Vandeventer have      written a book,</em> How to Publish a Directory of Home      Based Businesses for Fun and Profit, <em>which contains      more information Son their "home business" business, and      can be obtained for $11.50 (postpaid) by writing to H.B.D.
