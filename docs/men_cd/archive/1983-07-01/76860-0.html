        [1] This unassuming creek supplies the power for the wheel . . . and water for the McCray garden. [2] Once the ideal size and shape of the paddles were established, Dick used a sheet-aluminum tem plate to assure con sistency. [3] The paddies were mounted to the iron wheel with U-bolts and small aluminum bridges. [4] The PVC-pipe pump mounted to its swivel bracket. The intake hose with its foot valve is on the left, and the T's right arm delivers pres surized water.
