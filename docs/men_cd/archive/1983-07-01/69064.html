                    <h5 id="byline">      by Betsy Rogers    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>Now is the prime time to start next year's raspberry      patch!</em><br />      <br />      Strange as it may sound, some of my most vivid and      enchanting childhood memories concern days spent walking      dusty country lanes under a <em>scorching</em> summer sun .      . . because there, among the weeds and bushes of the      unkempt hedgerows, I'd see thick, tangled red raspberry      brambles. I can clearly recall toddling along behind my      mother as she stripped the leaning canes of their red      jewels. The fruit smell seemed to fill the air, sunlight      bounced in a green kaleidoscope from the leaves, and I was      thrilled to see an occasional garter snake hanging heat      drugged among the branches of a bush. Best of all, now and      then my mother would pop an especially succulent sun-warmed      berry into my mouth . . . and let me relish the special      sweet/tart taste that only a fresh picked raspberry      offers.<br />      <br />      Because of those magical yesterdays, I've always associated      summer with that rose hued fruit. Now that I'm older, I've      learned that the unique, palate-pleasing nature of the red      raspberry is due to the fact that the little fruits contain      an unusually high number of esters . .. volatile organic      compounds that-in combination with acids and such-produce      distinctive flavors and fragrances. And, while there are      two esters in blackberries, three in cherries, four in      apricots, and five in strawberries, the red raspberry      sports a total of nine of these ephemeral      tastemakers!		</p>	      <h3>A RUBY RARITY</h3>     <p>      Unfortunately, many folks are unable to obtain fresh      raspberries at any cost. Oh, if you live in the right part      of the country (and are lucky), you may be able to turn up      a patch of wild berries by scouring hedgerows, windbreaks,      and stream side brush. But it's quite unlikely that you'll      find the fresh fruit in your grocery store. Raspberries      can't be picked green to ripen later, you see, and they're      far too delicate to survive lengthy shipment. More often      than not, then, the only way to experience the flavor of      fresh-from-the-cane "redcaps" is to grow them      yourself.</p>          <h3>      PLANNI NG THE PLOT</h3>     <p>      Raspberries, which belong to the rose family (Rosaceae),      have been cultivated in England for centuries. In fact,      they were among the first fruits brought here by North      America's original colonizers. The red razz most commonly      grown today is a hybrid of the European species      <em>(Rubus</em> idaeus)-which takes its name from the fact      that the berries were found on Greece's Mount Ida in the      days of Carolus Linnaeus-and the wild North American      species <em>(Rubus</em> strigosus). Over the centuries,      many different raspberry varieties have been developed .. .      including the black, purple, and yellow strains, and even      some types that bear fruit twice in one season! (The off      color raspberries require slightly different care than red      ones do, and I won't have the space to discuss them in this      article.)<br />      <br />      Naturally enough, your first job as a prospective      raspberry-raiser is to select a site for your briar      patch-to-be. Some experts believe that the reds produce      exceptionally well in soil with a pH of 6 . . . but they      don't really seem to be too fussy about soil acidity. They      do, however, need earth that's moist, well drained, and      rich in organic matter. An abandoned garden plot, for      example, could serve as a bed . . . but only if it hasn't      been used to grow tomatoes, potatoes, melons, or eggplant      for at least three years, since all of these crops either      attract or carry disease organisms that can harm the      brambles.<br />      <br />      The plot should be in full sun, no closer than 500 feet to      any wild brambles (raspberries or blackberries), as these      might infect the less-hardy domesticated plants. Likewise,      you should also keep your bushes the same distance from any      "tame" <em>black rasp</em> berries, since that variety      could be killed by some diseases to which your reds can      safely <em>pIay</em> host.		</p>	      <h3>SOIL SEARCHING</h3>    <p>      As noted above, raspberries need rich earth to thrive (if      the soil doesn't contain enough humus, the fruit will be      small and have more seeds than pulp). The <em>best way</em>      to assure an adequate supply of organic material is to      raise a green manure crop, such as rye, buckwheat, or      clover the summer before you plan to put in your brambles      and, at the end of that growing season, to work the plant      material into the earth to a depth of two feet or more. In      other words, right now might be a prime time to "lay the      groundwork" for next year's patch! After such preparation,      my soil-building "maintenance" schedule has consisted of      little more than incorporating my non meat kitchen garbage      directly into the raspberry patch as it accumulates (other      folks seem to accomplish as much simply by fertilizing with      cow manure every four years). I also work rock phosphate      into the plot at four-year intervals, and-when soil tests      indicate a need -add nitrogen when the plants are in the      process of fruiting.		</p>	      <h3>PLANT PARENTHOOD</h3>     <p>      Even if you're able to find wild raspberries growing close      to home, I'd advise against transplanting these plants to      your prepared plot, for the native brambles could harbor      afflictions that haven't yet gotten a foothold on your      acreage. And besides, they won't produce the quantity or      size of berries that purchased hybrids will yield.      Therefore, unless domesticating the wildings is a matter of      economic necessity, I'd recommend that you buy disease-free      nursery stock.<br />      <br />      Your local gardening supplies dealer (or your county      agricultural extension agent) will likely be able to      suggest various strains that can be expected to do well in      your region. This is important information, as many red      raspberry varieties have rather specific climatic      requirements. (In my part of the country western Washington      state the Willamette, Canby, and Puyallup types      flourish.)<br />      <br />      You'll probably want to set out transplants in the early      spring, although-if you live in the South-fall plantings      will give your berries a bit of a head start. Regardless of      the season, you should check the roots of your      to-be-planted brambles as soon as you get them from the      nursery. They'll be potted or bare-rooted specimens, and-in      either case-it's essential that the roots be kept moist      until planted. Hence, if you can't move bare-rooted plants      to your patch right away, you should first soak them for a      few hours and then keep them covered with a damp cloth      or-better yet-bury the roots in loose, damp soil until      you're able to move them to their permanent home. (Do be      sure to plant the raspberries <em>before they</em> begin to      develop leaves!)<br />      <br />      Since a bramble patch can quickly get out of hand,      decide-before planting-how you will keep your canes under      control. At each end of my own 14-foot rows (which are six      to eight feet apart) is a 6-foot post . . . fitted with two      or three 2-foot crossbars. I string heavy wire between the      ends of these crosses-running it parallel to the rows-and      keep the canes restrained between the wires.<br />      <br />      (I've also occasionally used wires to connect posts that      aren't fitted with crossbars, and tied the canes loosely,      as I would tomato plants, to the wires.) When the bed is      prepared and the restraining wires are in place, you're      (finally) ready to start planting. Dig the hole for each      young bramble deep enough to allow it to be planted at the      <em>same depth</em> that it grew in the nursery or pot (you      can usually tell from the dirt line on the cane . . . if      not, simply make sure the tiny "growing points" on top of      the root will lie about an inch below the surface of the      plot). If you prepared the soil during the previous year,      there'll be no need to add extra nourishment at planting      time. But if you weren't able to till under a green manure      crop in the year prior to planting, merely dig the holes a      bit deeper than usual, putting compost in the bottoms.      Either way, you'll want to spread the roots out at the      proper depth, fill in the hole, and then give the young      plants a good soaking. For the next two to three weeks,      water the plants well at least twice a week unless the rain      does it for you. After that, trim back the canes to just      above the first pair of buds. Later, when the <em>new</em>      canes break through the soil and develop their own leaves,      you can cut the original stubs off at ground level.		</p>	      <h3>MULCH ADO</h3>     <p>      Two keys to good berry production are maintaining moist      soil and keeping competition-from weeds and grasses-to a      minimum. Frequent tilling between the rows can help control      the latter, but don't try to cultivate between the plants      themselves, or you'll risk damaging their root systems. I      think mulching is the best way to keep weeds down . . . and      to conserve soil moisture, as well. I place a      several-inch-thick layer of grass clippings throughout the      patch. (If rodents are a problem in your area, you might      keep the mulch six inches from the stems so as not to make      it <em>too</em> easy for them to hide within nibbling range      of the canes.)<br />      <br />      Of course, my part of the country is really quite moist,      with relatively mild winters, so I can get by with mulching      only during the summer months. In harsher climates, a      winter cover-over the entire bed-might well help protect      the soil from freezing.		</p>	      <h3>PRUNE AND PINCH FOR      PROGRESS</h3>     <p>      You'll no doubt be tempted to sample some of the fruits of      your (and the brambles') labor as soon as possible, but      it's best to postpone this pleasure until the second      growing season. Your initial crop would be small, anyway,      so steel yourself to pinch off the white blossoms as they      appear. By doing so, you'll allow the plant to put all of      its energy into developing a healthy root system . . . and      you'll reap the rewards for years to come!<br />      <br />      As you may know, raspberries are <em>perennial</em> plants      that produce fruit on <em>biennial</em> canes. Each year,      new shoots-called suckers-come up. These small canes lie      dormant over the winter, produce fruit during their second      season, then die. Every fall, you'll want to prune to the      soil level all canes that fruited that year . . . and burn      them, <em>away from the patch.</em> Then, early in the      following spring before any signs of new growth appear-cut      back the remaining canes to about four feet in      length.<br />      <br />      <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: The "ever bearing"; two crop varieties      are a bit trickier to prune, since their canes normally      bear in the fall of their first year and again in the early      summer of their second. You can trim the first-year stalks      back to about three feet during the winter months following      their first (autumn) berry production, and then cut those      old canes out completely the following summer, after they      finish bearing. Or, if you'd rather sacrifice the early      summer crop</em> in <em>exchange for an especially heavy      fall harvest, you can cut</em> all <em>of the ever bearing      stalks down to the ground each winter . . . and they'll      yield bountifully in the autumn, when very little other      fresh garden produce will be available.)</em>		</p>	      <h3>QUEEN HARVEST'S SURE TO      COME</h3>     <p>      In the late spring, I often pause in the midst of one      outdoor project or another to stroll over to the raspberry      patch and listen to the humming of the honeybees. At that      time of year, the tender green foliage shields a multitude      of small white blossoms, which - after receiving the      attention of the flying pollinators-will become tiny green      berries.<br />      <br />      While the canes are busily working at producing this fruit,      it's especially important that you make sure the plants      obtain enough water. In fact, although I live in an area      with abundant rainfall, I still water my patch whenever we      experience several hot days in succession. I don't      <em>sprinkle</em> the plants, as that encourages mold.      Instead, I soak the base of each cane with a trickling      hose.<br />      <br />      You won't have a bit of trouble guessing when your redcaps      are ripe: You'll be able to stand near the row and      <em>smell</em> those nine esters! The fruit will then be      firm but yielding, and each will slip easily off the little      white cone (called a <em>torus)</em> on which it      grew.<br />      <br />      Because of their delicacy, raspberries should be picked      into a shallow container . . . preferably one that holds no      more than four or five layers of fruit. Should a storm      strike your patch during the harvest days, be sure to      gather the berries immediately after it. Even pelting rain      can damage the frail fruit, and ripe, wet berries quickly      develop mold. And to best enjoy your pickings, eat or      process the fragile redcaps within 24 hours after they've      been picked.		</p>	      <h3>DON'T LET YOUR BRAMBLES RAMBLE!</h3>     <p>      Come autumn, when you're pruning back the season's fruiting      canes, you may also have to remove some of the first-year      canes to avoid overcrowding. On each plant, select five or      six of the healthiest new shoots -spaced four to six inches      apart-to leave for the following year. Then, <em>unless      you</em> want to expand the size of your berry patch (in      which case you'll have to wait for the early days of spring      to do your thinning), cut out the rest of the canes and      suckers.<br />      <br />      <em>To increase</em> the size of your plot, select the      hardiest of the new suckers and, before any growth appears      in the spring, carefully lift each one with a garden fork      (trying to get as much of the fibrous root as possible) . .      . and cut the cane from its parent plant. The new      mini-brambles can then be transplanted to prepared ground      and watered thoroughly.<br />      <br />      I've found that raspberries produce best from their third      to their seventh year, after which production seems to drop      off gradually. You should plan, then, to put in a new patch      every decade or so . . . placing it in a different location      and leaving the original plot berry free for five      years.		</p>	      <h3>RX FOR RASPBERRIES</h3>    <p>      The biggest threat that your bushes are likely to face is      disease. You can minimize the risk of being hit by such      problems, however, by buying disease-free stock . . .      keeping your reds isolated from other bramble fruits,      members of the nightshade family, and melons . . . and      making a habit of burning your prunings.<br />      <br />      Of course, there's always a chance that you'll encounter      trouble despite such pre cautions. Here's what to look for:      Anthracnose is a fungal disease that shows up a dark      indentations on the canes . . . raspber ry mosaic is a      viral ailment that affects the leaves by turning them      yellow and curling them . . . and spur blight shows up at      the bud junction, in the form of purple spots. I any of      these three ailments attacks a cane or canes in the middle      of a healthy patch, it's best to dig out the entire      infected plant and burn it. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Many      such</em> <em>symptoms-yellow, curled leaves in partic</em>      <em>ular-can also indicate a lack of water or nu</em>      <em>trients . . . so be certain that you're dealing</em>      <em>with a diseased plant before you destroy a</em>      <em>healthy specimen that's merely hungry or</em>      <em>thirsty.</em><br />      <br />      My raspberries haven't been troubled much by insect      invaders. However, some growers do report problems with      cane borers and Japanese beetles. The former make their      presence known by creating small holes in canes, which are      usually accompanied by wilting of the afflicted shoot. If      you notice these symptoms, cut the cane and burn it.      Japanese beetles are hard to <em>avoid</em> noticing . . .      and you can pick the large, metallic-colored pests off and      feed them to eager chickens or other fowl. (The commercial      pheromone-scented Japanese beetle traps also work      well.)<br />      <br />      Other potential berry thieves include deer, horses,      rabbits, and birds. Adequate fencing and netting draped      over the ripening fruit should keep these troublemakers in      line. Actually, I've found that the <em>biggest</em>      threats to a raspberry patch are children, who are likely      to swarm in and strip the canes of a whole day's pickings      that you'd earmarked for jam and jelly.<br />      <br />      Although I try to restrain such competition for my family's      crop, every now and then there'll be just too much fruit      for me to process at once. (At their peak, my two 14foot      rows produce between two and three quarts a day!) When that      "calamity" occurs, I gleefully order the whole household      out into the patch to eat the berries right of the canes.      No one has to be asked twice. Indeed, my husband annually      swears that it's his all-time favorite way to enjoy      redcaps. And, as each tender ruby morsel revives my      childhood memories, I always say that I agree!		</p>	      <h3>RED RASPBERRY RECIPES			</h3>		<p>	      Although <em>fresh</em> raspberries-right off the cane, on      top of cereal, or covered with milk or cream-certainly rank      among the greatest of culinary treats, the fruit of the      bramble can star in any number of tempting      <em>prepared</em> dishes, as well. Most cookbooks have a      goodly supply of such recipes, but here are a few of my      family's favorites . . . which you just might have a bit of      difficulty finding elsewhere.<br />      <br />      <em><strong>RASPBERRY RICOTTA PIE</strong><br /></em><br />      <em>pastry for a 9-inch pie shell (use your favorite      recipe)</em><br />      <br />      <em>2-1/2 cups</em> <em>of</em> <em>fresh      raspberries</em><br />      <br />      <em>3/4 cup of</em> <em>granulated sugar</em><br />      <br />      <em>1-1/2 tablespoons</em> <em>of</em> <em>quick-cooking      tapioca</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon</em> <em>of</em> <em>ground</em>      cinnamon<br />      <br />      <em>8 ounces</em> <em>of</em> <em>ricotta cheese</em><br />      <br />      <em>1 egg (separated)</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/4</em> <em>teaspoon</em> <em>of</em>      <em>salt</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/2 cup</em> <em>of</em> <em>half-and-half</em><br />      <br />      <em>1 tablespoon</em> <em>of</em> <em>lemon      juice</em><br />      <br />      <em>3/4</em> <em>teaspoon</em> <em>of</em> grated lemon      peel<br />      <br />      To begin, line a 9-inch pie pan with pastry. Next, combine      the berries, 1/2 cup of the sugar, the tapioca, and the      cinnamon until they're well blended . . . and let the      mixture stand for 5 minutes.<br />      <br />      While the berry mix is "resting", place the ricotta, the      egg yolk, the salt, the half and half, the remaining      sweetener, the lemon juice, and the lemon peel into a      blender and whirl the ingredients until they're pureed.      Then, in a separate container, beat the egg white until it      forms soft peaks, and fold it into the cheese mixture      <em>just enough</em> to blend the concoction.<br />      <br />      Now, spoon the berry mix into your pastry shell, and spread      the blended topping over the fruit. Finally, sprinkle the      cheese fruit mix with cinnamon before baking the pie . . .      first in a 425 °F oven for 10 minutes, and then at      350°F for another 30 minutes, or until the topping      appears firm when you shake the dish gently. This delicious      pie should serve at least six people.<br />      <br />      <em>RASPBERRY FOOL</em><br />      <br />      <strong><em>1 pound</em> <em>of</em> <em>fresh      raspberries</em></strong><br />      <br />      <em>3/4 cup of</em> <em>granulated sugar (or to      taste)</em><br />      <br />      <em>1 cup of</em> <em>heavy cream</em><br />      <br />      <em>2 tablespoons</em> <em>of</em> <em>powdered      sugar</em><br />      <br />      <em>3 tablespoons of raspberry brandy</em> (optional)<br />      <br />      Cook the berries and granulated sugar over very low heat      until the fruit is soft, then press the mixture through a      sieve (don't burn yourself!). After the puree has cooled      completely, lightly whip the cream in another container.      Then add the powdered sugar and brandy to the cream . . .      fold this mixture into the puree, using a rubber spatula .      . . and spoon the fool into four small bowls or glasses.      Chill the servings until they're very cold, and then dig      in! This traditional English dessert is especially good      when served with thin butter cookies or slices of pound      cake.		</p>		<h3>	      CHILLED RA SPBERRYSOUP</h3>     <p>      <em>2 cups</em> <em>of</em> <em>fresh      raspberries</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/2 cup</em> <em>of</em> <em>granulated sugar (or to      taste)</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/2 cup</em> <em>of</em> <em>sour cream</em><br />      <br />      <em>2 cups of</em> <em>ice water</em><br />      <br />      <em>1/2 cup</em> <em>of</em> <em>red wine</em><br />      <br />      <em>4 or 5 small, fresh nasturtium leaves<br /></em>      <em>(optional)</em><br />      <br />      whole raspberries (for garnish)<br />      <br />      This dish should be prepared at least 2 hours prior to      serving, to give the flavors time to "marry". First, rub      the berries through a fine sieve, then add the sugar and      sour cream. After mixing these ingredients well, add the      water and wine (periodically tasting the mixture to see if      it needs additional sweetening). Now, chill the soup . . .      and serve it in bowls garnished with a fresh nasturtium      leaf and a few whole berries. This recipe should make      enough for four or five servings.    </p>    <hr />
