                    <h5 id="byline">      by Sharman Russell    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>With the summer sun baking your garden soil, you might      want to try cultivating . . .</em><br />      <br />      Most modern gardeners have likely never heard of the tepary      bean. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Indeed, even a search      through <em>MOM's</em> seldom stumped editorial reference      library couldn't provide much information on the legume.]      The truth is, however, that this little-known      <em>plant-Phaseolus acutifolius--is</em> among North      America's oldest agricultural crops: The naturally heat-,      drought-, and pest-resistant bean has been identified in      strata that are at least 8,000 years old! It served as a      staple food for generations of prehistoric native      Americans, and-by 1701-was the principal crop raised at the      mission Nuestra Senora de los Dolores in New Mexico. In      fact, it was there that (according to one legend) the bean      got the name by which we know it today . . . because, when      the arriving Spanish asked a group of Papagos what they      were planting, the Indians responded, "T pawi, " meaning      simply, "It's a bean."<br />      <br />      However, while the original residents of the Southwest have      long taken advantage of the tepary's hardiness (the Papagos      and Pimas, among other tribes, still raise the bean), it      enjoyed little respect from the Spanish-who believed it to      be a degenerate version of their own favored legume, P.      vulgaris-and is all but unknown to today's commercial and      backyard growers. There are a number of good reasons to      <em>change this</em> policy of neglect. For one, the tepary      has produced yields of up to 700 pounds per acre without      irrigation . . . whereas most conventional dry beans won't      even survive in arid areas without supplemental watering.      (And when both crops are irrigated, the t pawi's yields can      equal or exceed the national average of 1,400 pounds per      acre for the more popular legumes.) With water shortages      and summer rationings occurring all too often over the past      few years, the tepary could prove to be an excellent choice      for many southwestern gardeners . . . and perhaps for folks      in other regions, as well.<br />     </p>      <h3>TEPARY CULTURE... BOWL AND ARROYO</h3>     <p>      <em>Phaseolus a</em> cutifolius is traditionally a two      season bean, with the first planting being made in early      spring and another in midsummer. (The Pimas sowed their      teparies when the mesquite bushes leafed out and again when      the saguaro was harvested.) The seeds some sources are      listed at the end of this article-should be planted two      inches deep, eyes down, and two to three inches apart . . .      with each row one and one half to two feet from its      neighbor. (Folks who plant by the moon generally agree that      the second lunar quarter is the prime bean sowing      time.)<br />      <br />      It's best to cultivate your tepary patch regularly, to keep      down weed competition, at least until the blooms appear.      Note, too, that these are pole beans, which will require      some sort of support (a wire or string fence would be a      good choice). And, though teparies will grow under very      arid conditions, they'll generally produce <em>better-as      noted</em> above-when watered. The legumes have a      reputation for adaptability, however, so, to find the      optimum amount for your location, you might want to vary      the waterings given to different clusters of plants in your      first crop and note the results.<br />      <br />      If you're in the mood for experimentation, you could try to      duplicate the early native Americans' method of      cultivation. Using a digging stick, such farmers would sow      three to five seeds, three inches deep, in hills spaced six      to eight feet apart. The Papagos often planted their      teparies at the mouths of arroyos, waiting till after those      gullies had been flooded with the early summer rains. These      areas are usually moister than the open desert, and they're      also rich in the nutrients and trace minerals washed down      by the seasonal torrents.<br />      <br />      Regardless of which growing method you choose, though, you      should know that teparies aren't eaten green. Let them dry      on the vine, and harvest the small kernels when they're      orange brown. Papago women traditionally shelled the beans      by beating the pods with sticks. The harvesters would then      parch the kernels over live coals to destroy any insect      eggs that might be present. (You can accomplish the same      thing by simply placing the beans, on a shallow baking pan,      in a 180Â° oven for 15 minutes . . . or by freezing them      for at least an hour.)<br />      </p>      <h3>BEAN CUISINE</h3>     <p>      Of course, no plant will find much favor among gardeners      uriless its productivity is matched-or exceeded-by its      popularity at the dinner table. And the tepary performs      well on both counts. Its flavor is sweet and delicate, and      the legume lends itself well to almost any recipe in which      more common beans are specified.<br />      <br />      Before cooking, let your teparies soak in cold water for at      least 12 hours. After that time, the beans will have      swollen to about twice their dried size, and will be ready      to be incorporated into your favorite dishes. (They may,      however, require more cooking time than do some other bean      varieties.) The following recipes have always received an      enthusiastic reception around my house. I hope they'll      provide you with a worthwhile "beginner's course" in tepary      cuisine.<br />      </p>      <h3>REFRIED BEANS</h3>     <p>      Boil some soaked beans-the amount will depend upon the      number of servings desired until they're quite soft, then      mash them into a paste. Flavor the dish, to taste, with      your favorite seasonings . . . minced garlic, diced chiles,      sauted onions, cilantro (fresh green coriander, also known      as Chinese parsley), cumin, oregano, and salt are commonly      used. Finally, fry the teparies in vegetable oil or lard      until they're very hot and have lost most of their moisture      . .. then serve them, as a complete meal, with tortillas,      cheese, and hot sauce. A serving of refried beans can also      be used as a side dish to accompany other main course      Mexican recipes.    </p>          <h3>TEPARY SOUP</h3>     <p>      1 large onion 2 cloves of garlic 1/2 pound of salt pork      crushed red pepper (to taste) 3 quarts of water 6 cups of      dried beans, soaked overnight and drained 1 cup of chopped      celery 1 cup of grated carrots salt and pepper<br />      <br />      First, chop the onion and mince or press the garlic cloves      .... then combine them with the salt pork, a judicious      amount of red pepper, and the 3 quarts of water. Bring the      mix to a boil and let it simmer for an hour (or until the      meat is tender). Now, remove the pork, dice it, and return      it to the stock, along with the soaked teparies. After      another 2 to 3 hours of gentle boiling, the beans should be      tender. At that point you can toss in your celery and      carrots, and when the soup has cooked slowly for 30 minutes      more-add salt and pepper to taste . . . and serve the      hearty meal. The recipe should feed a dozen people!<br />     </p>      <h3>ZUNI STEW</h3>     <p>      This meal is simplicity itself. To prepare it, just add      cubes of wild or domestic meat to a pot of soaked teparies      (still in their water), and boil the stew until the meat      <em>and</em> beans are tender. We like to season the dish      with coriander, salt, and chili powder . . . and      occasionally add corn kernels or diced squash early in the      cooking process-to create a <em>thicker</em> stew.<br />     </p>      <h3>IT'S A LONG WAY TO TEPARY. . .</h3>     <p>      I know of only two sources of tepary (also referred to as      <em>tepari)</em> seeds. They can be or dered--for 80d per      packet (about 200 seeds), plus $1.00 shipping and      handling-from Plants of the Southwest, Dept. TMEN, 1570      Pacheco Street, Santa Fe, New Mexico 87501 . . . or, at 802      (postpaid) for a similar sized packet, from Redwood City      Seed Company, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 361, Redwood City,      California 94046.      </p>      <h3>TRIAL AND ARID?</h3>     <p>      Summer's heat is coming into full swing, and thirsty      gardens are demanding more and more water. But with      shortages occurring throughout the country-and perhaps      rationing measures being taken in your own      community-chances are you're beginning to feel just a bit      guilty about the amount of the precious liquid your plot      requires. Now would be a good time to put in your own      experimental tepary patch ... and watch those beans grow      <em>high,</em> even when the soil <em>is dry.</em>    </p>    <hr />
