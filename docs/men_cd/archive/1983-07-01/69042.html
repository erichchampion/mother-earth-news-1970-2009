                    <h5 id="byline">      by Peter Hemingson      </h5>    <hr />		<p>	      <em>You don't have to alternately "dehydrate" or "flood"      your garden to keep it watered.</em>     </p>        <p>      Up until this year, my garden had always relied pretty much      on what nature supplied in the way of rainfall. Sure, I'd      get out the hose and sprinkler when we went too long      between showers . . . but I generally watered when I had      <em>time to,</em> not necessarily when the garden really      needed moisture.<br />      <br />      Now, I'm a convert to a <em>new</em> system of watering:      drip irrigation. This trickle watering method brings a      constant supply of liquid right to the roots of plants      either by a plastic hose with small valves (called      <em>emitters)</em> spaced every couple of feet . . . or by      microporous plastic pipes that weep liquid along their      entire length. Both systems share some very real advantages      over conventional methods of watering. For one thing, drip      setups use substantially <em>less</em> water . . . as much      as a third less, according to some studies. That's because      there is no runoff loss and much less evaporation than with      sprinkling or furrow irrigation. And since the moisture is      supplied just to the root area of the vegetables, few      <em>weeds</em> get watered between the rows!<br />      <br />      Especially important is the fact that the regular      application of appropriate amounts of moisture reduces      water stress on the vegetables. There's no cycle of      dry/wet/dry... what Dan Cotten of Submatic Irrigation      Systems compares to eating a huge turkey dinner every      Thursday, and then fasting the remaining days of the week.      Instead, the constant level of moisture leads to faster      plant growth and earlier harvests (an important      consideration if you're growing for market, where the early      crop wins top dollar).<br />      <br />      Of course, since the water is just in the soil and not on      the leaves, many troublesome plant diseases never get a      chance to start. (I'm hoping that a drip system will help      control an anthracnose problem I've had with my tomatoes.)      And there's another, somewhat unexpected, benefit that the      setup confers: Studies in Israel have shown that you can      grow salt-sensitive crops-such as cucumbers-in soil with a      high sodium content if you use drip irrigation. It seems      that the <em>constant</em> water pressure of the fed liquid      forces salt in the soil to the outer edges of the wetted      area, away from the plants' roots. This means that the      feeder roots have to contend with only the sodium content      of the water . . . not the more intense salinity built up      in the soil.<br />      <br />      Among the other benefits of drip irrigation are easier      garden maintenance-a turn of the valve is all that's      necessary to water your plants-and the potential for more      efficient fertilizing. With drip irrigation, liquid      nutrients can be delivered right to the root zone, so      there's no waste. For instance, an elevated large trash      bucket equipped with a strainer and outlet can be hooked      into your irrigation system to deliver homemade manure      tea.<br />      <br />      Granted, a drip system does have some drawbacks. The      technique is generally impractical for use with grain or      grass crops (though it's perfect for a backyard corn      patch). And its <em>initial</em> cost is greater than that      of most other watering methods. You can amortize the      expense over as many as ten years, however . . . and the      garden's increased productivity should help pay off the      cost.<br />      <br />      This year, I'm trying out two drip systems: a hose and      emitter setup from Submatic (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 246,      Lubbock, Texas 79408) and a micropore tubing known as      Viaflo-system from Irrigro (Dept. TMEN, 1555 Third Avenue,      Niagara Falls, New York 14304). Irrigro tubing "sweats"      water 'round the clock along its entire length, while the      Submatic two-feet-apart emitters are cycled on and off      every day. (Each system maintains the appropriate level of      moisture in the soil, though.) The Submatic basic system is      more expensive ($27.50 for 100 feet of tubing with 50      emitters installed) than the Irrigro ($14.95 for 100 feet      of microporous tubing), but the former will probably last      considerably longer.		</p>	      <h3>INSTALLATION</h3>    <p>      I chose to use two-foot-wide raised beds because the      uncompacted soil in such growing areas greatly enhances the      penetration of irrigation water. After adjusting the soil      pH, I rototilled the garden deeply. Then I excavated the      foot-wide walkways, mounding the soil I'd removed onto the      top of the beds. Next, I leveled the tops of my      15-foot-long plots.<br />      <br />      With the hard work out of the way, and I could install the      drip piping. I simply stretched the irrigation line along      the center of a bed, making a U-turn at the end of it and      laying the line over to-and then down-the next growing      strip. Then I covered each bed with a three-foot wide band      of 1.5-mil black plastic mulch. (If you lay the Irrigro      system on top of the ground, <em>you have</em> to cover the      line with black plastic to protect the white tubing from      ultraviolet radiation . . . but either system can be run      just under the surface of the soil.) Finally, I tucked the      fringes of the plastic under the soil to anchor it.<br />      <br />      Once the system was installed, I made slits for seeds and      transplants with a single-edge razor blade, and then      mulched the walkways with newspaper and spoiled hay. I'm      using the garden hose for my water supply line now, but      eventually I'll run a PVC line underground to the growing      area.		</p>	      <h3>SYSTEM ACCESSORIES</h3>     <p>      Studies have shown that most problems folks encounter with      drip systems are due to the emitters or micropores becoming      clogged by particles in the water. Both systems can be      flushed out, but <em>preventive</em> maintenance is a      better idea. Submatic sells an effective hose strainer that      filters out the bad stuff, and Irrigro has a filter screen      that does the same job.<br />      <br />      The other factor you may have to deal with is having to      reduce water pressure, since full household water force      could <em>rupture</em> your irrigation lines. The Irrigro      setup comes with a built-in pressure reducer, but you may      need to repair-or replace-your water valves if the faucet      can't be adjusted low enough to supply the flow of two to      four drops per second that the system requires. Submatic      has a preset hose-threaded pressure regulator that can be      screwed into the distribution line.<br />      <br />      You can buy a timer for the Submatic system (because the      Irrigro setup operates continuously, it doesn't need one),      but that's pretty much a luxury.. As far as I'm concerned,      the no-weed, no-work (I don't count turning a valve twice a      day as <em>work)</em> ease of this kind of irrigation is      luxury enough. All in all, drip irrigation seems a perfect      method for "persuading" your water and plants to do more      with less!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: If you'd like to design your</em> own      <em>drip system, all the necessary equipment pieces are      available from The Urban Farmer, Dept.
