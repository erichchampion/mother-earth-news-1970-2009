                    <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Smith    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      <em>One of the originators of the controversial      thermal-envelope home reaches</em> new      <em>conclusions!</em><br />      <br />      <em>In March of 1979, MOTHER featured a story on what was      at that time a rather</em> unusual <em>passive solar house.      For instead of collecting warmth and storing it in a      conventional medium, this double shelled maverick admitted      insolation into a greenhouse and then routed the      sun-tempered air-by convection through a vertical loop that      completely surrounded the living area. During its circuit,      the air gave up its heat to the mass of the inner structure      . . . and then, when it had cooled, it was reintroduced to      the solarium to be warmed anew.</em><br />      <br />      <em>In effect, the envelope of heated air not only tempered      the living quarters, but also provided a buffer zone      between the harsh outside climate and the moderate      atmosphere within the house . . . while the home itself      functioned as both collector and storage medium.</em><br />      <br />      <em>The structure worked, but many people-including Tom      Smith, the dwelling's owner, co-designer,</em> and <em>the      author of this article-had difficulty pinpointing      exactly</em> why. <em>Consequently, it wasn't long before      the design was called into question by individuals      knowledgeable in the solar field. But by the same token,      proponents of the "cause" were equally ready to defend      double-shell architecture, and did so. In the meantime,      various hybrid designs rooted in the envelope theme were      unveiled, and they, too, functioned well.</em><br />      <br />      <em>While all this was going on, though, Smith merely      observed quietly . . . and then got busy working out      the</em> modified <em>structure shown in the photos, based      on the knowledge he'd gained in the several-year interim.      Since Tom was one of the first to promote the original      double envelope concept, we think it only fair to give him      an opportunity to explain what his</em> new <em>design is      all about . . . and why it differs from t he old      one.</em><br />      <br />      I've had a tiger by the tail ever since my "thermal      envelope" home appeared in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>'!' over      four years ago . . . and to me it's ironic that what was      intended to be an expression of <em>simplicity</em> turned      instead into a source of confusion and controversy!<br />      <br />      Those not familiar with the course of events should know      that a lot of people initially thought my double-shelled      house wouldn't work. Then, when the house itself proved      otherwise, folks agreed that it indeed worked, but no one      could figure out exactly <em>why.</em> Finally, the solar      "experts" got into the discussion. As a result, the      theories and research became more sophisticated . . . but      the obvious seemed to become more obscure. The field even      polarized into camps of advocates and critics!<br />      <br />      The way I see it, though, while people were busy choosing      up sides to decide whether the double envelope was the      answer, many of us may have forgotten the <em>question.      So,</em> after all these years, I'd like to get a word      in.<br />      <br />      As I suggested back in MOTHER NO. 56, the real question has      always concerned the simplest way to achieve      energy-efficient architecture. In practice, this usually      involves eliminating things intelligently rather than      adding them on indiscriminately. Progress, then, should      imply an advancement beyond the double envelope to a less      complicated design. In fact, it should entail a farewell to      <em>all</em> the landmark systems typical of the pioneering      days of passive solar construction. Rather than consider      those prototype discoveries as carved in stone, we should      use them as building blocks for future, more effective,      models.<br />      <br />      In my own current generation of "envelope descendants", the      cumbersome double north wall has been totally eliminated,      and -in most instances-the double roof has been jettisoned,      as well. Moreover, I've carefully avoided borrowing from      other systems to make a new hybrid, because this practice      is usually an exercise in overkill . . . or is tantamount      to adding apples and oranges.<br />      <br />      True, the attached greenhouse and insulated stem wall      foundation of the previous design still exist, but not so      the convective loop or even the double envelope! What      remains, then, is kin only by virtue of its Smith house      "ancestry".    </p>            <h3>      BEYOND THE RED HERRINGS</h3>     <p>      Of course, before I could improve (read "simplify") the      original envelope design, I first had to understand exactly      what was going on <em>inside</em> it. Unfortunately,      attempts to calculate the performance of the house in solar      terms proved woefully inadequate, and in fact, the classic      solar math showed that the structure <em>couldn't</em>      possibly work because there were no concentrated volumes of      thermal mass present in which to store solar gain.<br />      <br />      Fortunately, no one mentioned this fact to the hundreds of      different envelope houses across the nation, so they      continued to happily save energy regardless. But if the      design wasn't operating according to the principles of      passive solar science, what indeed was it doing?<br />      <br />      Although a lot of attention was given to the efficacy of      the convective loop and its derivatives (owing, in part, to      the publicity my Lake Tahoe home received), I became less      convinced about that component's importance as time went      on. Of course, the next most obvious explanation for the      success of the design was the idea that the combined      R-values of the inner and outer shell in conjunction with      the buffering air space between amounted to super      insulation. That solution was admittedly appealing, but it      somehow seemed <em>too</em> obvious.<br />      <br />      In the winter of 1979, I got my first real clue that the      super-insulation premise didn't exactly add up. Upon      returning to my Sierra Nevada home late in the evening      after several days of travel, I was astounded to find-from      my recording thermometers that the greenhouse temperatures      had stayed in the mid-40's . . . despite the fact that I'd      been gone during a particularly in clement spell with      negligible sunshine and continuous temperatures in the      0°F to 30°F range!<br />      <br />      Now if these surprisingly warm temperatures had been      recorded within the main living area, I could have credited      the insulating effect of the home's double shell. But this      was inside the <em>greenhouse,</em> an area that      incorporated the very <em>antithesis</em> of thermal      protection: 390 square feet of minimal resistance glass      (with aluminum framing, no less), noticeable infiltration,      and an exposure to southwesterly winds that rip right      across the glazing's entire expanse. By rights, I      <em>should</em> have found ice on the windowsills!    </p>    <h3>      THE SOLAR-EARTH CONNECTION . . . AND MORE    </h3>    <p>      That experience prompted some real thought on my part. At      first, I was stumped: The only apparent source of energy      within the entire house was the intrinsic heat of the      refrigerator, the water heater, and a night light . . .      certainly not enough to maintain a 45 ° environment.      But then I _ realized that I'd been ignoring one fact all      along: The earth temperatures in the crawl space beneath      the house remained <em>constant</em> -at about 50      °Regardless of what was happening elsewhere. Like smoke      rising skyward, the earth was giving up its warmth whenever      the home's air temperatures dropped below the surface      temperatures in that sub floor area . . . and the faster      heat was lost to the outside, the more rapid that transfer      occurred.<br />      <br />      In effect, then, the earth under the house serves as a      "thermal brake" to decelerate winter's harshest impact.      Sure, a 45 °F greenhouse environment isn't exactly a      short sleeve climate (one reason it's easily overlooked as      an energy-saving factor), but its role in retarding heat      loss is significant. The total depletion from the inner      house is noticeably reduced because the temperature      differential between warm and cold areas is substantially      narrowed.<br />      <br />      For example, if a 65 °F bedroom environment is exposed      to the 45 °F temperature of an adjacent greenhouse      rather than to the bone-chilling 5 °F weather outside,      the heat loss from the interior is decreased <em>two      thirds</em> .. . a figure worth striving for in any      design.<br />      <br />      Now obviously, this impeded transfer isn't occurring at all      the structure's walls because not all of them face the      temperate, earth linked greenhouse. But the crux of the      matter is that this thermal cushion is present on the most      <em>critical</em> face . . . the glass-covered south wall      (the one that introduces warmth throughout the day, but      snatches it away-with interest-at night). Thus, the      greenhouse-earth connection offers the passive solar and      aesthetic benefits of south wall glazing <em>without</em>      the enormous disadvantage of unchecked heat loss.<br />      <br />      The earth's ability to temper a sheltered environment is      caused by several factors, which, in turn, ultimately      affect the envelope home's performance. First, daily solar      gain, coupled with the absorption of excess heat from the      house, contributes-in increments-to the thermal store in      the soil over the long winter haul. Second, seasonal lag,      the phenomenon by which the heat of the spring and summer      is soaked up in the earth for release during cold weather,      plays a major role in keeping the ground temperature up      (especially during the early winter). Finally, this      relative warmth <em>remains</em> under the structure      because its insulated foundation and walls provide      protection from both long- and short-term heat      losses.<br />      <br />      In all fairness, although the relationship between solar      energy and the earth's warmth is important to the system's      function, other design factors which can't be ignored are      also involved in the home:<br />      <br />      [1] The living area is zoned from the greenhouse during the      night, resulting in reduced heat losses from the inner      house.<br />      <br />      [2] Fewer faces are in direct contact with the outside than      in conventional structures, which normally have six outer      surfaces exposed.<br />      <br />      [3] Since the design emphasizes south glazing, only a      minimum of north, east, and west glass faces the outdoors .      . . resulting in less infiltration, fewer cold surfaces,      and less conductive heat loss than that experienced in      typical houses.<br />      <br />      [4] The surfaces, structural members, and furniture in the      building absorb excess solar heat, thus raising the home's      mean radiant temperature.<br />      <br />      [5] Because there's a natural tendency for residents to      line up main living areas along the well-lit greenhouse,      the floor plan often includes buffer zones-consisting of      closets, pantries, utility rooms, and the like-along the      three outer walls.<br />      </p>      <h3>DOING THE SAME . . . WITH LESS</h3>      <p>      In some ways, the approach I'm talking about may seem      fairly ordinary, but its implications are not. By making      <em>irrelevant</em> many of the design problems that have      concerned so many people over the past few years, we can      just eliminate those trouble spots and move on to an      simpler plan. In summary, many of the features which      typified the classic double-envelope structure simply are      no longer necessary, and it's now easy to understand why.      To begin, the double north wall just isn't worth the extra      building effort and expense it incurs. On one house I did,      the inclusion of that second surface would have saved about      300 BTU per hour worth of energy .. . roughly equivalent to      the heat given off by the family's pets. Attention to tight      construction and the minimal use of windows on that wall      will deliver performance nearly equivalent to that of the      double-skin designs.<br />      <br />      The double roof is superfluous for similar reasons,      especially since you can use less exotic options.      Occasionally, in locations with extremely hot summers, it      will pay to incorporate a top inner layer . . . if the      desired architecture lends itself to simple shell      construction (as is often the case with attics and the air      spaces of a gable roof). In these instances, though,      improved <em>cooling is</em> the goal. The high summer sun      will heat the outer roof, creating convective currents in      the air space that draw excess solar and intrinsic heat      from the structure through ceiling vents.<br />      <br />      Overkill on the south wall is also a mistake. The obsessive      concern for plenty of angled, south-facing glass that has      generally characterized passive design just isn't warranted      in a simplified earth-coupled structure . . . because we're      not worried about trying to heat tons of absorptive thermal      mass. A bit of excess isolation is certainly welcome, but a      ratio of 6:1 or 7:1 total floor area to south glass area is      quite ample in most instances.<br />      <br />      And I see no need to develop hybrid designs based on      thermal mass or super insulation. The house works      <em>without</em> these additions, so the money spent on      them could be put to better use in tight construction,      weathernization, or improved distribution of available      heat.<br />      <br />      True, my updated design is only a beginning, but it's a      step in the right direction. There still exist many things      to explore, and there are yet a number of unanswered and      pertinent-questions. But the important thing now is that we      all move on to the next generation of passive design with a      bit less excess baggage . . . recognizing as we go that      progress is nothing more than the elimination of things      unnecessary.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Smith has compiled an updated      portfolio, which includes many different house designs,      floor plans, and detailed explanations.

Obviously, because of the endless variety of situations      encountered in the field, these points are only general      guidelines . . . but they should aid in the understanding      of the total concept.</em><br />      </p>      <h3>DO'S</h3>      <p>      <em>[1] Insulate the foundation to a depth of one foot</em>      below <em>the frost line to a value of approximately R6. A      continuous, draft free layer is most effective. Be sure to      use a water-resistant material (extruded polystyrene, jot      example), and take care to protect it from the      deteriorating effects of sunlight above grade by using      stucco or surface bonding cement.</em><br />      <br />      <em>[2] install foundation vents with insulated shutters      along the north wall, using the rule that you'll need one      square foot of vents to every eight linear feet of that      wall's surface. These should be opened in the summer for      cooling.</em><br />      <br />      <em>[3J Put a six-millimeter polyethylene vapor barrier an      the surface of the crawl space floor and cover it with two      inches of clean</em> <em>sand. This will prevent moisture      from being drawn up through the ground and condensing on      the greenhouse glass.</em><br />      <br />      <em>[4J Provide for effective drainage around the house by      using gutters, landscaping that encourages runoff, drain      networks, or any other standard means . . . but be sure it      works. Otherwise, water moving through the ground under the      house will remove accumulated heat.</em><br />      <br />      <em>[5] Design the south wall with a glass area roughly      equal to 75% of the total floor space. Vertical standard      glass is fine. Angled glazing can be used for aesthetic      purposes if desired . . . but avoid leaning the glass back      at an angle greater than 45°.</em><br />      <br />      <em>(6J Minimize east, west, and north windows, both in      number and size. If you must sacrifice this rule for a      view, compensate by using highly insulated glass or thermal      shutters at these openings.</em><br />      <br />      <em>[7J Consider using large amounts of openable glass      between the greenhouse and the living area's south      wall</em> . . . for <em>both improved air distribution and      aesthetic purposes.</em> <em>[8J Utilize a ceiling fan in      the greenhouse to force stratified heat downward and into      the living space, where it will be absorbed by surrounding      surfaces.</em>    </p>    <h3>      DON'TS    </h3>    <p>      <em>[1] Don't bother to put more heat into the crawl space      earth by mechanical means or by the use of a convective      look.
