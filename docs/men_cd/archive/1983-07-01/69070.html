                    <h5 id="byline">      by Wayne Fugate    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      Last summer my sore hands and 1 decided it was time to find      an easier way to shell dried beans. I'd heard that letting      the beans soak for a couple of hours in a bucket of water      would soften the pods and make for more carefree "husking".      But summertime on our homestead keeps my family on the move      so much that 1 considered even that method to be too      time-consuming. Then 1 hit upon a solution: Why not take      advantage of all that running about and let our feet <em>do      the chore?</em><br />      <br />      <em>Now, I simply lay a burlap bag on a flat surface, fill      it two inches thick with the dried beans, tie the open end      securely, and place the sack on the back porch or on a</em>      protected, well-traveled walkway. After just a few days of      being trampled underfoot by my family's many comings and      goings, the beans are shelled! (I do turn the bag over      daily and make sure it stays dry.)<br />      <br />      <em>Once all the hulls are beanless, I give the poke a      couple of vigorous shakes . . . which causes the beans to      shift down to the bottom and leaves the shell pieces to be      easily</em> scooped <em>off</em> <em>the top. Next, the pod      free legumes are given a good washing and placed in a      135Â° oven for a couple of hours until<br /></em>      <em>they're thoroughly dry. (This also will kill</em> any      weevils in the seeds.)<br />      <br />      <em>My foot-shelled beans are then ready to be stored in      airtight containers. What's more, my hands aren't a bit      sore,</em> and <em>I've managed to conserve two of any      gardener's most important assets: time and energy!</em>    </p>    <hr />
