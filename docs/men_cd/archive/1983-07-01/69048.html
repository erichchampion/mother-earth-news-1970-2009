                <p><strong>      You can find out how heavy of "Pork Chops" really is.    </strong></p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Donald Wickman    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      For a 4-H club hog project last year, I helped my      youngsters construct an affordable, easy-to-use "porker      pound counter" with some extra fencing we had lying around      our farm . . . an old plank . . . and a couple of bathroom      scales. The total cost of our enterprise was $1.00, which      we spent for a used scale we found at a thrift shop (the      other one was borrowed from our own bathroom).<br />      <br />      Using the exterior wall of an outbuilding for one side, we      completed the needed pen in almost no time. Then my      children placed a plank inside the enclosure, with a scale      under each end, and put the contraption right to use. With      a bucket of grain, one of them coaxed the oinker to the      center of the board, while the other noted the readings on      both scales. Afterwards, they calculated the hog's poundage      by adding these two figures and then subtracting the      previously recorded weights for the plank alone from the      total . . . which gave them an answer that-as we later      verified-was accurate to within four pounds!<br />      <br />      What could be simpler? The following example shows how we      calculated the weight of one of our animals.    </p>		<p>      <br />      We've also discovered that our method is perfect for      weighing sheep and goats, too. So, if you've got any      problem in counting (animal) pounds around your homestead,      why not solve it by building your own thrifty      do-it-yourself livestock <em>I,</em> scale?
