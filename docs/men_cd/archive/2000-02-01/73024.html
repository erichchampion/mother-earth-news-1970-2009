        <p id="issue">Issue # 178 - February/March 2000</p><div class="image"> Just in time for spring planning and planting, All-America Selections (AAS) has announced its winning seed choices for 2000. A nonprofit organization dedicated to testing and trumpeting outstanding new cultivars, AAS has for the past 67 years introduced gardeners to some of the best new vegetables, flowers and bedding plants in North America. Joining the ranks of AAS winners this year are four new vegetables that'll add color and flavor to any garden ... virtually guaranteed.</div><div class="image"> <strong>Genus, species: <em>Brassica oleracea var.</em><em>sabauda</em></strong></div><p><strong>Common name:</strong> cabbage<br /><strong>Unique qualities:</strong> It is the earliest known savoy cabbage and is decorative with a waffle-like leaf texture<br /><strong>Head size and weight:</strong> 6" to 8", 1 to 1 3/4pounds<br /><strong>Head shape:</strong> round or slightly pointed<br /><strong>Plant height:</strong> 10" to 12" <strong>Foliage color:</strong> green exterior, yellow-green interior<br /><strong>Garden spacing:</strong> 12" apart<br /><strong>Growing time:</strong> 55 days from transplant<br /><strong>Closest comparisons on market:</strong> Savoy Ace, Savoy King</p><h3>Savoy Express cabbage</h3><p>You'll love this cabbage, which can be harvested in little more than half the time of most savoys on the market (55 days after transplanting in the garden, as compared to 100 growing days for most others). Savoy Express' sweet flavor makes it great for slaws or mixed in a salad of raw, fresh greens. And its diminutive size (under two pounds) means small families won't regularly find themselves tossing out half-eaten heads that have gone to rot.</p><p>Savoy Express can be grown in either spring or fall in most areas of North America. To grow from seed, sow indoors about five to six weeks ahead of when you think you'll be transplanting to the garden (after the threat of frost has passed). With its decorative, waffle-like leaf texture, the Savoy Express makes not only a tasty but a beautiful addition to vegetable and flower gardens alike.</p><p><strong>Genus, species:</strong><em>Zea mays</em><br /><strong>Common name:</strong> sweet corn <strong>Unique qualities:</strong> multicolored kernels, sweet flavor<br /><strong>Cob size:</strong> 7" to 8" (16 to 18 rows)<br /><strong>Kernel colors:</strong> yellow, white, red, purple<br /><strong>Plant height:</strong> 84"<br /><strong>Ear height:</strong> 30"<br /><strong>Garden spacing:</strong> in rows 6" to 8" apart<br /><strong>Growing time:</strong> 79 days<br /><strong>Closest comparisons an market:</strong> Honey & Pearl, Appaloosa</p><h3>Blushing Beauty pepper</h3><p>Reminiscent of fall maple leaves, this unique bell pepper changes color as it grows and matures. The fruit begins life its a pale green or ivory color, proceeds to a pastel pink not unlike the shade of a white zinfandel wine, then finally turns a deep rosy red when fully ripened.</p><p>Blushing Beauty peppers can be picked at any color stage and will still taste sweet - perfect for fresh salads. Thick walls also make them ideal stuffing peppers.</p><p>The Blushing Beauty is resistant to the tobacco mosaic virus and three races of bacterial leaf spot. And its small stature (the plant only reaches about two feet high) makes it perfect for container gardening. Grow some Blushing Beauties on your back deck and enjoy the particle of changing colors.</p><h3>Indian Summer sweet corn</h3><p>One look inside the husk of an Indian Summer ear and you know you've got something special. The yellow, white, red and purple kernels make this corn almost too pretty to eat. But don't let that stop you. Indian Summer is, according to AAS, the first sweet corn with both multicolored kernels and a super-sweet flavor. Full-grown, the ears measure about eight inches long; ears harvested too soon may not show their peak colors, but as the ears mature, the colors become more vibrant and only intensify with cooking.<br /><br />To ensure uniform germination, Indian Summer corn needs to be planted in soil that has warmed to about 60°F or better. For best (and consistent) results you'll want to isolate Indian Summer from other sweet corn varieties, either by planting at a distance of 500 feet, or by staggering the planting so as to guarantee a 14-day difference in maturity dates.</p>
