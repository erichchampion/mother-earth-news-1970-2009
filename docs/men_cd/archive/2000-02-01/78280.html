                    <p>      <strong>From bulgar to kasha: Secrets of cooking with      grain.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      If you wanted to eat like a prince, you had to be one. Even      nobility had to rely on the occasional bowl of gruel to      sustain them as they hung around a dank castle. Grain      dishes also provided a convenient spoon food, since the      fork didn't come on the scene until the year 1077.    </p>    <p>      Grains were, and still are, an economical food that is easy      to eat with a spoon. But we now also know that whole grains      are a good low-fat source of protein, complex carbohydrates      and fiber, plus vitamins and minerals. While our      governments USDA Food Pyramid is telling us that grains      should be the bulk of our diet, the National Cancer      Institute says that Americans are not getting the 20 to 35      grams of fiber that we need daily to help fight off cancer.      One food historian speculated that during the Dark Ages,      people ate at least 50 grams of fiber daily. While plagues      were causing people to drop like flies, cancer wasn't in      the picture.    </p>    <p>      This doesn't mean, however, that we should load up on white      rice and Wonder Bread. A whole grain consists of the bran,      germ and endosperm. Refined grains have been stripped of      the bran and germ, which contain most of the nutrients,      leaving the endosperm with its complex carbohydrates. The      government decided to replace this loss with a low dose of      synthetic vitamins, calling the grain or flour "enriched"      or "fortified." which makes about as much sense as having      your teeth pulled so you can wear dentures. But it was      unable to replace the soluble and insoluble fiber, which      proves again that you can't fool Mother Nature.    </p>    <p>      So grab a spoon and dig in... the wine and ale are up to      you.    </p>    <h3>      Mixed Grain Salad    </h3>    <p>      <em>1/2 cup each long-grain brown rice, pearled barley,      wheat berries CI use hard wheat berries)</em> <em><br />      3 1/2 cups water<br />      1/2 cup uncooked adzuki beans or another small bean (or use      1 cup canned beans. rinsed)<br />      2 cups cooked corn, fresh or frozen,. defrosted and      drained<br />      4 green onions, chopped<br />      1 green pepper, finely diced<br />      Topping: cilantro or parsley (optional)</em>    </p>    <h3>      Dressing:    </h3>    <p>      <em>1/4 cup each: lemon juice, extra-virgin olive oil</em>      <em><br />      I teaspoon curry powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon each: cumin, coriander<br />      3/4 to 1 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      cayenne pepper to taste</em>    </p>        <p>      In a large, covered saucepan, bring the water to a boil.      Add the grains, cover and reduce to a simmer. Simmer for      about 40 minutes or until the water is absorbed (grains      should not be sticking to the bottom of the pan) Let the      pan cool, covered, for at least 15 minutes. While the      grains are cooking. simmer the beans in a covered saucepan      with enough water to cover for about 50 minutes or until      tender. Drain and put into a large mixing bowl. Add the      chopped vegetables. In a small bowl, whisk together the      dressing. Stir the cooled grains in with the vegetables and      beans. Pour on the dressing and toss until blended. Serve      topped with chopped cilantro or parsley.    </p>    <p>      Variation: Try using green lentils (not baby lentils)      instead of bean,.    </p>  		<h3>Quinoa Pine Nut Pilaf		</h3>    <p>      Ready to eat in fifteen minutes, this easy pilaf is great      with grilled chicken breasts or fish.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 tablespoon olive oil</em> <em><br />      1 medium onion, finely chopped<br />      2 large garlic cloves, minced<br />      1/2 green pepper, finely diced<br />      1/2 red pepper, finely diced<br />      2 teaspoons each: ground coriander, ground cumin</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>dash cayenne pepper<br /></em> <em>1 cup quinoa<br />      1 2/3 cups water<br />      1/3 cup toasted pine nuts</em><br />      <em>1/4 teaspoon salt or to taste<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      finely chopped parsley (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Put the quinoa in a strainer and rinse well. In a large      skillet, saut√© the onion and garlic over medium-high      heat until softened. Stir in the peppers and spices for      about a minute until fragrant. Add the quinoa and water,      cover and simmer on low for 15 minutes. Remove from heat      and let sit, covered, for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, in a dry      skillet, toast the pine nuts over medium heat, shaking the      pan every 30 seconds. Watch carefully so they don't burn.      Stir the pine nuts, salt and pepper into the quinoa. Serve      topped with chopped parsley.    </p>    <h3>      Hot Vegetable Couscous    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups whole wheat couscous</em> <em><br />      1 1/2 cups unsalted chicken broth, vegetable broth or      water<br />      1 1/2 teaspoons curry powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon cumin powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      cayenne pepper to taste</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons evtra-virgin olive oil<br /></em> <em>1      can (15 ounces) garbanzo beans, rinsed<br />      1 red pepper, diced<br />      2 small zucchini, diced<br />      1 medium red onion, chopped<br />      3 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      1/2 cup chopped cilantro or parsley</em>    </p>    <p>      Put the couscous in a large bowl and have a lid ready.      Bring the broth to a boil, remove from heat and mix in the      spices. Stir the broth into the couscous and cover for 15      minutes. Meanwhile, chop the vegetables. Heat up 1      tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat      and add the vegetables. Saute until almost tender, stirring      frequently. Stir in the garlic and cook another few      minutes. After the couscous has been sitting for 15      minutes, add the other tablespoon of olive oil and fluff up      the mixture with a fork so there aren't any clumps. Add the      beans and vegetables and toss. Serve topped with chopped      cilantro or parsley.    </p>    <p>      My husband thought the couscous needed additional olive oil      or a sauce. Here's a quick sauce similar to one that we had      over a vegetable couscous in a Middle Eastern restaurant:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Sauce</strong> (optional):    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup plain, smooth-style bottled marinara sauce      (without vegetables)</em> <em><br />      1 cinnamon stick</em>    </p>    <p>      Simmer ingredients in a saucepan for at least 5 minutes.      Drizzle over couscous.    </p>	<p>			<strong>Tabbouleh Salad<br /></strong> I usually make    lots of this Middle Eastern salad when we have an abundance    of garden tomatoes, but it's good in the winter months also    since parsley and plum tomatoes are readily available. A    Lebanese friend once told me that the secret to good    tabbouleh is to use plenty of parsley and a good quality    olive oil.		</p>    <p>      <em>1</em> <em>cup bulgur<br />      1 1/4 cup boiling water</em>    </p>        <h3>      Dressing:    </h3>	<p>			<em>1/3 cup lemon juice<br /></em> <em>3 tablespoons    extra-virgin olive oil<br />    1/2 teaspoon salt<br />    dash of cayenne pepper and freshly ground pepper<br />    1 large clove garlic<br />    1 1/2cups chopped curly parsley<br />    4 green onions, chopped<br />    1 small cucumber, peeled and cut into half-inch cubes<br />    2 medium-size tomatoes or 4 plum tomatoes, cut into half-inch    cubes<br />    mint leaves (optional)</em><br />	</p>	    <p>      Put the bulgur in a large mixing bowl. Stir in the boiling      water, cover and let sit for about 30 minutes until the      water is absorbed. Whisk together the dressing in a small      bowl and set aside. In a food processor, mince the garlic      and parsley until the parsley is chopped very fine. (You      can mince it by hand but this way is easier.) When the      bulgur is ready, drain off any excess water and add the      garlic, parsley and green onions. Stir in the dressing. If      you're serving the salad within a few hours, stir in the      cucumbers and tomatoes, then refrigerate. If you want to      eat it the next day, store the cukes and tomatoes      separately in a plastic container.    </p>    <p>      At serving time, stir them into the salad. Taste to see if      it needs additional salt and pepper. Serve on a bed of      fresh greens and top with fresh mint. This salad is best      the same day because the cukes and tomatoes will make it      too watery.    </p>    <p>      Variations: If you don't want to buy the Third World cukes      and tomatoes that are available during winter months, try      other ingredients instead, such as celery, radishes, red      peppers, black olives or toasted pine nuts. I like to      crumble feta cheese on top of my tabbouleh salad. Instead      of bulgur, try couscous for a lighter tabbouleh.    </p>    <h3>      Nondairy Rice Pudding (Vegan)    </h3>    <p>      For those of you who long for Uncle Ben's plain ol' white      rice, this low-fat, nondairy dessert is for you. Rice milk      will also work for this recipe, but I prefer 2% fat soy      milk.    </p>    <p>      <em>3 cups vanilla soy milk (I use 2% fat for a creamier      pudding)</em> <em><br />      1 cup water<br />      4 thin slices gingerroot<br />      15 whole cardamom pods<br />      3 short cinnamon stick</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 1/4 cups white basmati or long-grain<br /></em>      <em>white rice (brown rice will not work)<br />      1/2 cup maple syrup<br />      1 teaspoon good quality vanilla cup<br />      1/2 chopped dates*</em>    </p>        <p>      In a large saucepan, put 1 cup of the soy milk, plus the      water, gingerroot, cardamom, cinnamon and rice. Bring to a      boil, then immediately reduce to a simmer and cover. Simmer      for 20 minutes until the rice is tender. Remove the      gingerroot, cardamom and cinnamon sticks, making sure to      keep the cardamom pods intact because the seeds inside are      bitter. Discard. Stir in the remaining 2 cups soy milk,      maple syrup, vanilla and dates. Pour into a plastic      container or bowl and let cool at room temperature. Eat      warm or refrigerate. The pudding will thicken as it cools,      so you may need to stir in additional soy milk. Serve in      glass bowls topped with a sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar.    </p>    <p>      *I buy whole, pitted dates because date pieces usually dry      out. Fresh dates should be soft and slightly sticky. Chop      into small pieces with a sharp knife or scissors.    </p>
