        ABOVE LEFT: Loose harvested asparagus spears, washed and bundled spears (the way you find 'em in the market), and a fresh school after it has pushed through the soil. Strawberry rhubarb plant and stalks. Note flowers developing on top of plant. RIGHT: Everyone is familiar with the dandelion. But did you know you can eat all parts of the plant...even its roots?
