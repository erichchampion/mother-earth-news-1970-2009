                <p>      <em>Reprinted from THE COUNTRY GENTLEMAN, copyright 1915,      The Curtis Publishing Company</em>    </p>        <hr />    <h3>      Sanitary Poultry Ranges    </h3>    <p>      MORE chicks are hatched and reared each succeeding spring      and summer. The ever-increasing demand for broilers,      breeding birds and pullets for laying pens has created in      the poultryman a desire to raise a larger percentage of the      chicks hatched, and this has resulted in a realization of      the importance of several small points, one of the most      important being the condition of the ranges over which the      youngsters run. The old idea that chicks will grow      successfully anywhere out of doors is laid aside, for now      not only are chicks required to grow, but they must grow      quickly and continuously. As growing chicks spend most of      their time on the range during the late spring and summer      it naturally becomes necessary to have that range in such      condition that it will tend to produce and maintain the      health and vigor of the stock.    </p>    <p>      The question of what kind of range is of first importance.      On many farms the orchard is the first place to be thought      of as summer range for the chicks. The writer has used a      peach orchard for this purpose with fine results. An      abundance of shade is always to be found beneath the fruit      trees, while the surface soil of an orchard is always fresh      if it is well kept. Some good green crop is always growing      in the orchard, which insures against contamination.    </p>    <p>      It must be admitted that the effect on the chicks is likely      to be better than the effect on the fruit trees, but if the      chicks are not left on the orchard after the fruit is      reaching development there will be little trouble. The      writer has found that chicks may be kept on peach-orchard      range until they are four months of age before they will do      much injury by roosting in the trees at night or by eating      the fruit.    </p>    <h3>      Don't Bury Dead Hens    </h3>    <p>      If it is not convenient to use the orchard the next best      range is a cornfield. The soil must have been turned under      and thoroughly tilled before the corn can have made growth,      thus insuring that the field is in a sanitary condition.      The luxuriant corn plant furnishes the shade that is so      essential to the health of the fowls during the hot months.    </p>    <p>      If the surface soil of a range is not turned under and kept      perfectly fresh accumulations of droppings and filth soon      make excellent breeding places for disease germs and      vermin. The type of soil affects this point. The chicks      should range on a sandy loam soil, preferably, as that type      is most easily and quickly drained.    </p>    <p>      There are other possibilities for sanitary ranges. Soy      beans make good shade and the crop is excellent for growing      poultry. The planting of several rows of sunflowers is      good, not only for the shade, but also for the seed, which      may be saved and fed with great profit to layers during the      molting season.    </p>    <p>      The range should be roomy. The exact number of chicks that      can be placed on any range will depend largely upon the      nature of the range itself. There should never be so many      chicks as to keep the green crops entirely eaten down. Oats      may be sown as a spring cover crop, to be followed by a      mixture of oats and field peas, and then by soy beans.    </p>    <p>      The range should have shelter from the sun during the      summer days. If it is not possible to have a grove, or an      orchard, or corn, or sunflowers as a part of the range, it      is wise to build a wooden shelter in some part of the      field. Shade keeps the birds comfortable and growing      continuously. It prevents death by sunstrokes. The water      fountains should be placed in shady spots. If possible      select a poultry range with running water on it.    </p>    <p>      Cleanliness is an absolutely essential feature. Never bury      dead carcasses on the poultry range-in fact they should      never be buried, but always burned. Last summer the writer      visited a number of poultry farms on which there had been      many mysterious deaths among the growing chicks on the      ranges. In every case it was found that dead carcasses had      been unearthed by the growing chicks and the eating of the      partly decayed flesh had caused a sort of ptomaine      poisoning. Puddles of stagnant water should never be      allowed to accumulate in any part of the field. Disease      germs multiply in stagnant water and so infection spreads.      These pools may be destroyed by ditch drainage in most      cases, though sometimes it may 1) to tile drain. The colony      houses should he located on the higher ground of the range.    </p>    <p>      Plow the poultry ranges in order to keep fresh ground on      top. This means a succession of green crops on the range,      and also prevents the surface from becoming packed and slow      to drain. Chicks like to scratch in the loose, fresh earth,      and that is Nature's way for keeping their bodies free from      lice and other vermin.    </p>    <p>      Making the ranges sanitary and clean is not a spring job      only. It is a piece of work that will need attention      several times during the summer. Chicks can grow      continuously and thrive well only when they are surrounded      with healthful conditions. Cleanliness removes the agencies      that work against their best development.    </p>    <p>      Colony houses must be roomy and well ventilated, for      growing chicks need fresh air during the night as well as      during the day. The simpler the design of the houses the      better, for they are more easily kept clean.    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      The R. F.D. Letter Box    </h3>    <h3>      Ration for Jerseys    </h3>    <p>      I should like to have a balanced ration for my Jersey cows,      composed of as few grains as possible, such as wheat, corn,      oats and barley products. Also please advise me if my      practice of adding a handful of charcoal to each feed is      profitable. A. R. G., W. Va.    </p>        <p>      THE amount of grass that the cows consume daily will have a      considerable influence on the amount of grain and other      rough-ages that should be fed. We shall assume that the      pasture is not good enough to supply all the roughage      needed. The flow of milk will also influence the daily      allowance of grain and roughage. Two-thirds of a full      ration should be sufficient, which would allow one pound of      grain to each four to five pounds of three and onehalf per      cent milk produced daily. The hay should be allowed at the      rate of one-half pound daily to each hundred pounds live      weight. For the grain feed a mixture of corn or      corn-and-cob meal, 400 pounds, dried brewers' grains, 150      pound., and bran and cottonseed meal, 75 pounds, will give      satisfactory results.    </p>    <p>      When the cows are kept in the stable and fed a mixture of      clover and timothy hay as roughage the same grain mixture      will suffice, except that about fifty pounds of oil meal      should be added to the mixture and this fed at the rate of      one pound of grain for each three pounds of milk produced      daily. The roughage should be fed in such amounts as the      cows will clean up daily. No change in the amount fed daily      need be made when all clover hay is fed. The amount of      cottonseed meal or bran in the ration may be slightly      reduced. The feeding of such grains as wheat, oats and      barley is not advisable, as they are too expensive.    </p>    <p>      There is no harm in feeding a small amount of charcoal to      the cattle. It might be well to put some salt in the      mixture, as otherwise the cattle will have to be salted at      intervals of about a week. W. H. T.    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      Starting a Quince Orchard    </h3>    <p>      How many quince trees do you recommend to the acre? R. R.      T, Mass.    </p>        <p>      QUINCE trees are usually set about twelve feet apart in      each direction. At that rate approximately 300 trees may be      planted to the acre. It is difficult to advise you how many      quince trees it would be profitable for you to plant. A      great deal depends upon the demands of the markets to which      you intend to ship. We should advise that you consult      commission men and grocers before deciding upon the size of      the quince plantation. The demand for this fruit is very      limited and in years of plentiful crops it has been amply      supplied. Do not put out too large an area in this fruit,      especially at the start. Two or three acres for the initial      planting would be sufficient. H. R. C.    </p>    <h3>      The Recipes You Wanted    </h3>    <h3>      To Dry Hominy    </h3>    <p>      'PUT four quarts of shelled corn in a large I kettle; fill      with water and set on the back of the stove, where it will      cook but not burn; add three tablespoonfuls of baking soda      and cook the corn for six hours. After cooking keep in a      large crock. The corn may be winnowed and dried.    </p>    <p>      There is also another method: Take one gallon of good wood      ashes and three gallons of water; put the ashes in a sack      and boil until the lye is strong; then take out the ashes      and drain off the lye. Wash the kettle and put the lye      back; put in the corn and boil until the lye takes off all      the outside husks of the corn. Drain and dry.    </p>    <h3>      Cracked Wheat Bread    </h3>    <p>      BOIL a cupful of cracked wheat in a pint and a half of      water for an hour; then cool and add half a cupful of      molasses, two teaspoonfuls of salt, a yeast cake dissolved      in half a cupful of tepid water, two tablespoonfuls of      melted butter, and sufficient flour to make a stiff dough.      Knead well and let rise. Knead a very little, divide into      two buttered bread pans, let rise again and bake for forty      minutes in a moderate oven.    </p>    <p>      Another method is to mix a cupful of cold boiled cracked      wheat with a cupful of cornmeal, two teaspoonfuls of baking      powder, a teaspoonful of salt, a tablespoonful of butter,      the beaten yolks of two eggs, a cupful and a half of milk      and the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Turn into a      buttered baking dish and bake in moderate oven for an hour.      Serve from the dish.    </p>
