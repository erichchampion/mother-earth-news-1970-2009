                        <p>      I love my wife's homemade bread but, for the life of me,      I've never been able to cut it into straight and even      slices. Never, that is, until I hit upon the idea for the      combination bread slicer/ cutting board/serving tray you      see here. Now I can zip off perfect slices every time ...      even paper-thin ones!    </p>        <p>      My little invention works on the same principle as a      carpenter's miter box (as a matter of fact, I got the idea      while watching a carpenter friend cut some miter joints).      The only difference is that my device was made specifically      to handle delicious homemade loaves of bread. Just slide a      loaf into place, position the blade of a long, sharp knife      in the slots ... and you can't help but cut straight and      true.    </p>    <p>      And?happy surprise!?although this gizmo was designed for      bread alone ... it's also ideal for eggplant, squash,      cheese, or almost any other sliceable food that'll fit into      it.    </p>    <p>      The whole slicer can be made from one piece of wood      measuring 3/4" X 6" X 54". As you can see, the short plank      Is cut into three 18"-long lengths ... two of which are      shaped as shown (for sides) before being fastened to the      third (which forms the slicer's bottom).    </p>    <p>      Feel free to change the shape of the sides shown here if      you think you have another pattern in mind that you like      better. Whatever design you decide to use, though, you'll      probably find it easiest to put the two pieces of wood      together and cut out and slot both sides at the same time.      (And those slots, of course, should be cut down far enough      so that?on assembly?they'll come out just even with the      base's top surface.)    </p>    <p>      And a final word about dimensions: The slicer shown here is      big enough to handle loaves made in most of the bread pans      I've seen. If your loaves are bigger (either taller or      wider), though, no problem:    </p>    <p>      Just scale your unit up to fit.    </p>    <p>      I assembled my slicer/board/ tray with eight 2"-long wood      screws (four on a side) as illustrated, and the screws have      done the job. If you're the kind who wears both a belt and      suspenders, however, you can run a bead of good wood glue      down the faces of each joint before you screw the sides of      your slicer to its base.    </p>    <p>      It goes without saying, of course, that you'll sand all      surfaces of all three pieces of wood clean before final      assembly. And the completed bread slicer can be left      unfinished, rubbed with vegetable oil, or stained and      coated with a hard, oil-resistant finish (such as      polyurethane).    </p>    <p>      As a little extra touch, my wife had me drill a hole in one      end of our slicer's base so we can hang it on the wall when      it's not in use. Which means that the newest tool in our      kitchen is not only a great bread slicer ... it's a      wonderful conversation piece tool!    </p>
