                <h5 id="byline">      by DOROTHY ROBERTSON:    </h5>            <p>      My husband, Al, is a large man. He's 6'5-1/2" tall and-when      well-weighs 230 pounds (all muscle, no fat).    </p>    <p>      The only problem is that, starting in 1950 and for the next      22 years, Al was never really what you could call well.      He'd lose his appetite and his weight would sag down to      180. He felt continually fatigued, tense, and irritable. He      suffered from night sweats ... often severe ones. He was      frequently depressed, sometimes even deeply apathetic. He      had headaches, leg, chest, and back muscular pains. His      eyesight-even his hair! - changed. Stomach and intestinal      gas caused him increasing discomfort. Various small      fatty-like nodes began appearing tinder his skin ... and Al      experienced increasing cycles of general weakness and      malaise.    </p>    <p>      Since the symptoms of tuberculosis are often quite similar      to those that Al was exhibiting, he took tuberculin skin      tests ... which proved negative, leaving us right where we      had started. Even the various medicos that my husband      consulted didn't know what his ailment could be. They      wouldn't even hazard a guess!    </p>    <p>      So Al did what so many people seem to do in a similar      circumstance: He took the one-a-day vitamin capsule that      our medical establishment claims is all the dietary      supplement that anyone eating modern processed food needs .      . . and plugged along as best he could on sheer willpower.    </p>        <p>      And then we discovered Adele Davis's wonderful books on      nutrition and the importance of vitamin supplements in our      daily food intake. Al increased his dosage of vitamins A,      all the B family (including choline, pantothenic acid, and      ara-aminobenzoic acid), C, D, and E . . . in addition to      liquid lecithin and the potent multi-vitamin perles      manufactured by Plus Products under the trade name "Formula      74".    </p>    <p>      This vitamin therapy helped Al's condition enough to be      noticeable ... but not enough to keep him (at age 60) from      taking a forced medical separation from his civil service      job. We sold our desert home and, hoping that a change in      climate might help my husband's condition, moved up into      the mountains of northeastern California.    </p>    <p>      For a while the move, the fresh mountain air, the lessening      of tensions, and the stepped-up intake of vitamins seemed      to give Al a new lease on life. He rebuilt the old house we      had bought, put in a garden, and planted fruit trees. He      even opened a small refrigeration business!    </p>    <p>      Then, after four years in our new home, Al's condition took      another turn for the worse. He sought out three more      doctors in an attempt to learn why his health was failing.      . . again, to no avail.    </p>    <p>      Finally, when lymph glands-on his neck, under his armpits,      and in his groin-began to swell, my husband traveled 600      miles and presented himself to an old doctor friend for an      examination.    </p>    <p>      The diagnosis-in seconds!?was: "You have cancer. I'm afraid      it's terminal by now. What ever made you wait so long      before getting medical aid?" What could Al say? He had been      seeking medical aid for 22 years!    </p>    <p>      Actually, as we've since learned, my husband's case really      hasn't been as unusual as we first thought. We now know      that many-not just a few, but many?cancers grow very slowly      and quietly for 20 years or more (years during which their      victims suffer from hard-to-pinpoint but very real feelings      of depression, pain, weakness, etc.) ... before suddenly      developing into obvious malignancies-This long,      drawn-out, hidden stage of a cancer's growth-      furthermore-can become even longer, more drawn-out,      and harder to detect if the cancer's host is middle-aged or      older.    </p>    <p>      Al's cancer, then, was far from being a one-of-a-kind      malignancy. Quite the opposite! It was actually an      almost-ideal textbook example of how this disease develops      in a middle-aged or older individual ... and we'd still      like to know how so many doctors could have examined my      husband without ever suspecting what his real trouble was.    </p>    <p>      As soon as we did know "the worst", of course, Al's doctor      made immediate arrangements for my husband to enter the      University of California's Oncology Center at San Francisco      for tests, observation, and treatment. There he was once      again told that his case was terminal ... and he was      started on chemotherapy.    </p>    <p>      Miraculously, even though the treatments made him very ill,      Al experienced a clinical remission of his cancer after      only two weeks! We continued the chemotherapy for another      seven months, however, just to "clinch" the "cure". Al was      then allowed to rest for several months before a final      series of radiation treatments that would "kill off" any      lurking cancer cells that might still be hidden in his      body.    </p>    <p>      Alas. The radiation weakened him ... and Al could feel      himself sliding downhill once again.    </p>    <p>      It was at just this time that we read of Dr. Linus      Pauling's success in fighting cancer and other diseases      with massive doses of vitamin C (see The Plowboy Interview      in MOTHER NO. 49 for Dr. Pauling's own thoughts about this      work). "Surely," we told each other, "this distinguished      scientist-the only man ever to be awarded two      unshared Nobel Prizes-must know what he's talking about.      Surely it won't hurt to at least give his vitamin C therapy      a try."    </p>    <p>      Al began experimenting with both Dr. Pauling's massive      doses of vitamin C and comparable intakes of other vitamins      and minerals (everything he thought he'd need to rebuild      his body and keep it healthy). After adjusting several such      therapies for his own height and weight, he soon settled on      the following self-treatment:    </p>    <p>      VITAMIN A: 25,000 U.S.P. Units (1 daily. These can be      toxic, so he only maintains this intake for a few days ...      then lets up ... then continues the dosage again a few days      later, etc. 1. VITAMIN B1: 25 mg (3 daily). VITAMIN B2: 25      mg (3 daily). VITAMIN B6: 25 mg (3 daily). VITAMIN B12: 25      mcg as in Streptomyces Fermentation Extractive activity      from Cobalamin Concentrate, plus 6-1/2 grains of brewer's      yeast (6 dai*). CHOLINE: 7-1/2 grains (3 daily, with      meals). PANTOTHENIC ACID: 50 mgs (3 daily).      PARA-AMINOBENZOIC ACID: 30 mgs (3 daily). NIACINAMIDE: 100      mgs (1 daily). VITAMIN C: 16 grams (160,000 mgs, divided      into three daily doses). VITAMIN D: 10,000 U.S.P. Units (I      daily for a few days, then a break, then 1 daily again for      a few days ... just as with vitamin A). VITAMIN E: Mixed      tocopherols, 400 International Units (6 in the morning and      6 in the afternoon). DOLOMITE AND BONE MEAL TABLETS: 1,287      mgs calcium, 303 mgs magnesium, and 294 mgs phosphorus (24      daily). POTASSIUM AND IODINE: 75 mgs potassium chloride and      0.15 mgs kelp iodine (3 daily, one after each meal). ZINC:      10 mgs (1 daily). LIQUID LECITHIN: 1 tablespoon after each      meal.    </p>    <p>      In addition to the above, Al goes to a good doctor in town      once a week for a vitamin B12 shot. And when he thinks he      needs the boost, he drinks a quart of Adele Davis's famous      protein drink, Tiger's Milk.    </p>    <p>      If you've never tried it, Tiger's Milk is made by blending      together- preferably in a liquefier-one-half cup of      banana, crushed or chunk pineapple, berries, or other fruit      ... two tablespoons of soy, safflower, or other vegetable      oil ... one or two cups of fresh skim milk ... one-half cup      of non-instant, powdered skim milk ... and one-half cup of      brewer's yeast. One teaspoon of vanilla can also be thrown      in for flavoring and-when the mixture is smooth-add two or      three more cups of fresh skim milk (enough to make a total      of one quart of milk in the blend).    </p>    <p>      If you don't care for the taste of this basic recipe, you      can vary it by substituting other fruits, undiluted frozen      orange juice, or one to two tablespoons of blackstrap      molasses for the fruits mentioned above. Al, for instance,      blends up his drink from either one quart of non-fat milk      or fruit juice, a heaping tablespoon of lecithin/papaya      enzyme, a heaping tablespoon of blackstrap molasses, and a      heaping tablespoon of flaked yeast with calcium and      magnesium. He whips it all together in the blender and      drinks it whenever he thinks he needs a boost from this      high-protein pick-me-up.    </p>    <p>      Then-to top off all the vitamins, minerals, and Tiger's      Milk I've already described-my husband takes another three      multi-vitamin perles (supplemented with chelated minerals)      every day. These perles (one with each meal) contain equal      potencies of natural vitamins A, B1, B2, B6, D, and E in      oil form and calcium and magnesium in a two-to-one ratio.    </p>    <p>      As far as we know, this massive intake of vitamins and      minerals is NOT a cancer cure. We DO know, however, that      Al's cancer was diagnosed as "terminal" twice and that the      "conventional" radiation treatments he took for the disease      seemed to do more harm than good. We also Do know that Al's      health has dramatically improved since he began his vitamin      therapy, and we feel certain that he'd never have lived      these last five precious years without his vitamin therapy.      We hope and pray he has another five years of grace ahead      of him.    </p>    <h3>      SURPRISE!    </h3>    <p>      I've been taking many of the vitamins and minerals that my      husband takes and-whether or not his self-administered      therapy has actually halted the development of his      cancer-we do know one thing: 50 mgs of pantothenic acid and      30 mgs of para-aminobenzoic acid taken three times a day      (once with each meal) definitely will turn gray and graying      hair back to its original color.    </p>    <p>      Pantothenic acid and para-aminobenzoic acid, at least, most      certainly have worked this miracle for us. As soon as we      began taking them, we noticed that our hair was gradually      darkening ... darkening ... darkening ... until, finally,      it was almost its old color. What a happy surprise! We're      not gray anymore ... but the change came from "panto" and      "PABA" vitamins ... not a dye bottle! -DR.    </p>
