                    <h5 id="byline">      by ANNE AND PAUL EHRLICH    </h5>        <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through their      writing and research-gave special meaning to the words      "population" "resources", and "environment" in the late      1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution,</em>      <em>and did a lot to make</em> ecology <em>the household      word it is today.) But while most folks are aware of the      Ehrlichs' popular writing in the areas of ecology and      overpopulation (most of us-for instance-have read      Paul's book</em> The Population Bomb) ... <em>far too few      people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are      involved in ecological research (research of the type that      tends to be published only in technical journals and      college textbooks.) That's why it pleases us to be able to      present-on a regular basis-the following semitechnical      column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul      Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      COEVOLUTION AND PEST CONTROL    </h3>    <p>      Until very recently, biologists seemed to think that plants      just had to lie there and take it. Caterpillars chomped      their leaves, aphids sucked their sap, and cows and goats      slaughtered them outright. Only occasionally did plants do      anything-grow spines, for instance, in the case of      cactuses-to protect themselves from the onslaught of      herbivores (plant eaters).    </p>    <p>      In the last decade, however, this picture of "defenseless"      plants has changed completely. Biologists now realize      plants have an astonishing array of defenses-both      mechanical and (especially) chemical-at their      disposal. Plants-we now know- <em>do</em> protect      themselves.    </p>    <h3>      THE ROLE OF COEVOLUTION IN NATURE    </h3>    <p>      Our own involvement in this revolution of understanding      began in 1964 when one of us (Paul) had a series of      conversations over coffee with plant evolutionist Peter      Raven. Paul had asked Peter about some seemingly strange      choices of food-plants made by butterfly caterpillars. For      example, closely related butterfly species ate apparently      unrelated plants ... but sometimes those plants-such      as the ones of the citrus and carrot families fed upon by      the caterpillars of certain swallowtail butterflies-      contained similar chemicals. What began as casual      conversations soon escalated to a ransacking of the      extensive scientific literature on butterfly foods and      plant chemistry.    </p>        <p>      A Glaucopsyche butterfly lays eggs on a lupine flower bud      in the large photo above. The small picture inset on the      left shows a caterpillar of the Glaueopsyche butterfly      eating the flowers. Note the ant-which "milks" sugary      secretions from special glands on the caterpillar-guarding      the sluglike larva. A close-up of the Glaucopsyche eggs are      shown in the small photo on the right.    </p>    <p>      In the course of this literature search, it became apparent      that plants and butterflies had-over the centuries-been      fighting a sort of evolutionary war. Certain poisonous      "secondary" chemical compounds in the plants-it turned out      were nothing less than sophisticated weapons of chemical      warfare. In turn, to protect themselves, the butterflies      had evolved tricks for avoiding or detoxifying (making      harmless) these poisons. What's more, each new defense      strategy evolved by the plants put pressure on the      butterflies to evolve a new attack ... and each new      strategy of attack by the insects called for a reciprocal      defensive response by the plant. Paul and Peter called this      kind of point- counterpoint stepwise evolution involving      more than one species " coevolution".    </p>    <p>      In many cases, coevolution has led to great specialization      on the part of herbivores. The swallowtail butterflies, for      example, are so adept at detoxifying one kind of chemical      produced by their citrus- and carrot-family hosts that the      chemical has actually become an attractant!    </p>    <p>      Interestingly, human beings have long co-opted some of      these plant defenses for human use. Most of the spices with      which we flavor our food are defensive chemicals of plants.      So are most of the hallucinogenic drugs (marijuana and      opium, for example). Hallucinogens, by the way, represent a      particularly clever evolutionary strategy: After all, if      you're a plant, why spend the energy needed to produce      massive amounts of poison if a few molecules of a      psychoactive chemical can make the antelope that's just      nibbled your leaves go off and attempt to mate with a lion?    </p>    <p>      Many medicines also originated as plant weapons (quinine      and digitalis, for instance). Caffeine, nicotine, and      cyanide are other toxins that plants use to disrupt the      life processes-and blow the minds-of their animal enemies.    </p>    <h3>      WHY IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND PLANT HERBIVORE      COEVOLUTION    </h3>    <p>      As the world food crisis intensifies, the demand for better      methods of crop protection will increase ... and as the      demand for crop protection grows, the petrochemical      industry will doubtless attempt to meet that demand with      the "tried and false" method of broadcast spraying with      pesticides to exterminate pests. The results are      monotonously predictable: huge expenses for farmers      (leading to higher food prices) ... rapid evolution of      resistance in pest populations ... promotion of non-pest      insects to pest status as these insects' natural enemies      are decimated ... medical problems for farm workers (and      consumers) ... widespread damage to the ecological systems      essential to the support of human society ... and-of      course-high profits for pesticide manufacturers.    </p>    <p>      An understanding of plant-herbivore insect coevolution can      help explain this failure of modern pest-control methods.      For millennia, plant-eating insects (the "bad guys" inmost      farmers' eyes) have been evolving ways to keep plants from      poisoning them. This-among other factors-makes it      relatively easy for these insects to evolve resistance to      the poisons applied by farmers. The insect predators (the      "good guys") that prey on the plant-eating insects,      however, have relatively little evolutionary experience      with poisons. The natural enemies of insect pests are thus      sadly vulnerable to the very poisons that farmers have used      to control the pests.    </p>    <p>      The interrelation of these factors was made particularly      clear to us some years ago when our group was doing      fieldwork in Trinidad. At the time, local farmers were      having trouble with Helicanius caterpillars eating their      cultivated passion fruit plants. Pesticides were cheap in      Trinidad, but it seemed that the more pesticides the      farmers sprayed, the worse their pest problem became. As      luck would have it, the research we were doing on this      Caribbean island focused on mountain populations of      Heliconius butterflies ... beautiful long-winged denizens      of the tropical forest that lived as adults for up to four      months and laid their eggs on wild passion fruit plants.    </p>    <p>      Our investigations of the natural butterfly populations      quickly gave us insight into why the Heliconius caterpillar      could not be controlled with pesticides. Passion fruit      plants-it so happens-have what are known as      extra-floral nectaries ... little structures on the stems      of leaves that ooze nectar, a sweet substance that-in most      plants-is found within the flower itself. It appears that      the function of these nectaries is to attract ants ... and      ants are the most important enemies of young Heliconius      caterpillars.    </p>    <p>      Now, as we said above, predators are almost always more      susceptible to poisons than are herbivores. We ultimately      concluded that the pesticides used by the passion fruit      growers were wiping out the population of predatory ants      that normally kept the Heliconius caterpillars under      control ... while, at the same time, the caterpillars (with      their long evolutionary history of feeding no-and      coping with-poisonous plants) were able to evolve      resistance to the manmade poisons.    </p>    <p>      In a microcosm, then, the ant-Heliconius-pesticide story is      the story of all non-evolutionary agriculture. Such      agriculture substitutes crude technological fixes (massive      use of pesticides) for sophisticated exploitation of the      evolutionary and ecological properties of the agricultural      system.    </p>    <h3>      INTEGRATED PEST CONTROL    </h3>    <p>      Is there any way that the "almost everybody loses" scenario      of past nonevolutionary agriculture pest control practices      can be avoided? The answer is yes ... through integrated      control procedures. Integrated control means the management      of pest populations using a wide variety of techniques.      Extermination is not attempted (no chemical control program      has ever achieved that goal anyway) ... rather, the aim is      to keep pest populations small enough so that the damage      those pests do will remain at an economically acceptable      level.    </p>    <p>      Integrated control programs employ such methods as crop      rotation, introduction of natural enemies, enhancement of      the crop's natural defenses, and (sometimes, but not      always) the use of synthetic pesticides. When such      pesticides are employed, they're applied only when      absolutely necessary and different compounds are used at      different times to retard the evolution of resistance among      the pests.    </p>    <p>      The latter strategy -avoiding resistance by using a variety      of pesticides (rather than assaulting the pests continually      with the same poison)-has also been used by plants      themselves in their coevolutionary war with pests. Our      research group discovered this when we were examining the      ecology of small blue Glaucopsyche butterflies and their      lupine food plants in Colorado.    </p>    <p>      By a series of exercises that involved-among other      things-counting butterfly eggs while biting flies      ricocheted between our eyeballs and our hand-lenses, we      demonstrated that the butterflies can (and do) inflict      severe damage on the lupine plants. The butterflies lay      their eggs on the flower buds, and their caterpillars eat      the buds and flowers. Often, 50% or more of the potential      seeds of the plants are devoured ... but damage varies from      lupine population to lupine population.    </p>    <p>      To better understand why some lupine populations suffered      more caterpillar damage than others, careful biochemical      analysis of the plants was carried out. The results were      surprising: Those plants in the populations that were most      severely attacked by caterpillars often contained larger      quantities of poisons than plants in relatively undamaged      populations ... but the lightly damaged populations were      made up of the plants with the most variable mix of      poisons. These results led to the notion that biochemical      variability itself may be an important defense mechanism of      plant populations.    </p>    <p>      This only makes sense. Young pest insects feeding on a      single plant are exposed to one particular mix of poisons      in their food. The survivors will be those insects that      happened to be somewhat resistant to that particular mix of      poisons. But those survivors will lay their eggs on other      plants, many of which will have a different mix of poisons.      Given this situation, the population of pests cannot easily      become resistant to the plant population's poisons, because      generation after generation the insects face different      evolutionary challenges. (By the same token, when insects      are challenged by the same poison-DDT, say-over and      over again, the pest population quickly becomes resistant.)    </p>    <h3>      PUTTING ECOLOGY TO WORK    </h3>    <p>      What does all this mean to you? If you're a gardener or a      farmer, it means that you may be able to reduce your pest      problems if you can find ways to mix the various strains of      crops that you plant. (The absence of sufficient      agricultural research in this area means that there are      increasing opportunities for home experimentation here.)    </p>    <p>      If you aren't a gardener or farmer, but just someone who      eats, breathes air, or drinks water, you should be      concerned about the general problem of how to reduce      pesticide usage ... because that also means reducing the      chances that you (or an ecological system vital to you)      will be poisoned. Research into ways of reinforcing the      natural defenses of crops is one of the most obvious routes      to reduced pesticide usage.    </p>    <p>      At present, the tendency is to breed most of the defensive      compounds out of crops ... because these compounds tend to      poison us, too (or else taste awful). But clever breeding      programs to localize the toxic chemicals into parts of the      plant that we don't eat (or to make the poisons disappear      as the crop ripens, as is the case with apples) could well      make food crops more pest-proof. Indeed, it may be possible      to achieve substantial pest protection by planting fields      with a mixture of biochemical types of a given crop in      which the average amount of poison is low enough that the      human toxicity of the harvested food is essentially nil.    </p>    <p>      You can do something to push our agricultural system in the      right direction. Write to your Congressman (Washington,      D.C. 20515) and urge him/her to find ways to encourage      research in integrated pest management. While you're at it,      mention the need for non-USDA research money. (The U.S.      Department of Agriculture has-in the past-often behaved as      a subsidiary of the pesticide industry. USDA research funds      tend to go to the same "spray 'em again" bunch that's      responsible for bringing our pest control system to what a      recent National Academy of Sciences study found to be a      dismal state.)    </p>    <p>      If the system can be turned around, you may once again find      some (though we hope-not much) insect damage in your      produce, and maybe even an occasional worm in an apple or      aphid in a salad. But let's face it: A little insect      protein is good for you. The dose of nerve poison (and/or      carcinogen) that you're likely to get today in your fruits      and vegetables is not.    </p>    <p>      For a general overview of the pesticide problem, see      Chapter 11 of Ecoscience: Population, Resources,      Environment, by Paul R.
