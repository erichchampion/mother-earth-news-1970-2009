                    <hr />    <p>      IT seems that Portland, Oregon's Vincent Carman (see "Can      This Transmission <em>Really</em> Double Your Car's      Mileage?" in MOTHER NO. 48) isn't alone. At least one other      group of inspired experimenters has found a way to use      hydraulics to vastly increase an automobile's gas mileage.    </p>                <p>      That group is a class of advanced students at Minneapolis,      Minnesota's Hennepin Vocational Technical Center. And under      the guidance of instructor Ernie Parker (and without ever      having heard of Vince or his Inertial Storage      Transmission), the class recently designed and built what      they call a "hydraulic storage transmission".    </p>    <p>      Does it work? It sure does! As the students have already      demonstrated, when their special drive train is coupled to      a 16-hp Tecumseh engine, installed in a Volkswagen chassis,      and covered with a Bradley GT body ... the resulting      one-of-a-kind automobile will travel (at speeds up to 70      mph) an incredible 75 miles on a single gallon of gas.    </p>    <p>      That's impressive, especially when you remember that the      HVTC fuel-stretcher was entirely constructed from      off-the-shelf components that are readily available to any      home mechanic in any part of the country. The sleek little      automobile contains absolutely no exotic technology or      hardware at all.    </p>    <h3>      IT ALL BEGAN IN 1920    </h3>    <p>      The HVTC class project was originally launched because of a      1920 magazine article brought in by student Tom Steincamp.      The piece described an automobile with a hydraulic drive      train and labeled the vehicle "the car of the future". Some      library research and a few group discussions soon convinced      the class that the idea was a good one ... but that it      would be even better if an energy saving accumulator was      added to the hydraulic system.    </p>    <p>      Before long Parker's crew had roughed out a preliminary      design of the new hydraulic drive. And the concept looked      so good on paper that the group simply decided to go ahead      and build one to see how it would work.    </p>    <h3>      THE FIRST PROTOTYPE WAS A DUD    </h3>    <p>      Parker's students quickly scrounged up a well-used VW      chassis, a 60-hp VW engine, and enough hydraulic odds and      ends to assemble a crude prototype of their design. It was      a disappointment. The vehicle ran well enough, but it      consumed only slightly less gasoline than a stock      Volkswagen.    </p>    <p>      "This thing's got just too much horsepower," someone said.      "Maybe a VW with a stock transmission needs 60 hp to get      around ... but with the hydraulic drive train we've      designed, I think a Volkswagen can get by with one heck of      a lot less muscle."    </p>    <p>      Everyone agreed and the team of experimenters quickly      rounded up a tow vehicle and began running a series of      "drawbar tests" to determine the least amount of engine      they needed to adequately power their 1,800-pound car.      Result: The students concluded that a 16-hp Tecumseh      overhead valve powerplant would do the job ... provided      that their VW chassis was enclosed in a very      aerodynamically clean envelope. (Say, something like the      Bradley GT body that somebody just happened to want to      donate to the project! )    </p>    <h3>      HVTC CAR NUMBER TWO WORKS!    </h3>    <p>      Just as Ernie Parker's engineering team was finishing its      Second- generation "fluid powered" carriage, the      opportunity arose to enter the machine in a Minnesota      Society of Automotive Engineers economy run.    </p>    <p>      The test course was a 100-mile "average" trip (one-third      city, one-third suburban, and one-third country driving)      and the HVTC vehicle had less than one mile on it when the      rally began. As far as this particular car was concerned,      then, the run was far less a competition than a shakedown      cruise to flush out the bugs which always hide in every new      engineering concept.    </p>    <p>      Sure enough, the HVTC automobile had its share of gremlins      ... one of which was so serious that the car rolled up      "only" a "disappointing" 50 mpg. As instructor Parker      explains it:    </p>    <p>      "A valve we had changed the evening before vibrated closed,      thus starving the vehicle's hydraulic pump of oil. If we'd      mounted the valve's lever just 90 degrees to the left or to      the right, this wouldn't have happened. The mistake really      murdered us in the competition, though, because-with that      valve closed-our car's engine had to pump twice as much oil      as necessary to push the machine down the road."    </p>    <p>      Were the HVTC students licked by this less-than-ideal first      public showing of their hydraulically driven automobile? Of      course not! They just pitched in, exorcised the imps and      goblins from the car, and put the machine back on the road.      Further tests soon showed that the vehicle's combination of      [1] aerodynamic body, [2] 16-hp engine, and [31 "infinite      gear ratio" hydraulic drive and energy storage system is a      real winner.    </p>    <p>      The little car will accelerate from 0 to 60 miles per hour      in a very satisfying eight seconds. Furthermore, under "no      wind" conditions, the automobile can cruise down the      highway at a steady 70 mph ... while carrying a reserve in      its accumulators that will push it on up to higher speeds      for a short distance. And it does all this on a maximum      fuel consumption of .9 gallons per hour ... which works out      to a shade better than 75 miles per gallon. (Are you paying      attention, Detroit?)    </p>    <p>      Still, Ernie's class is quick to point out that its car can      be improved a great deal more. One of the most obvious      refinements, the students say, will be the elimination of      the vehicle's VW transaxle. "We left the transaxle in so we      wouldn't have to redesign the VW chassis's suspension,"      they point out, "which means -since nothing is 100%      efficient-that we've combined the inefficiencies of our      hydraulic drive with the well-known inefficiencies of the      old mechanical drive. If and when we couple our hydraulic      motor directly to the car's wheels, we should realize a      marked improvement in our car's efficiency."    </p>    <h3>      THE SAME, YET DIFFERENT    </h3>    <p>      The Hennepin Tech students' energy storage transmission is,      in some ways, quite similar to Vince Carman's Inertial      Storage Transmission featured in MOTHER NO. 48. Both use      off-the-shelf hardware and well-proven technology. Both      dramatically extend an automobile's gasoline mileage by      capturing, storing in an accumulator, and later using the      energy that ordinary automobiles normally waste during      braking and when they are idled in city traffic with their      engines running.    </p>    <p>      But the two transmissions are quite different too. Carman,      for instance, uses "fixed displacement" pumps and motors in      his hydraulic drive train because he feels that they're the      most efficient ... while the HVTC student team chose      "variable displacement" hardware because such pumps and      motors are easier to control.    </p>    <p>      Another major difference: The Portland car's engine is run      at a constant rpm and is turned off as soon as it has      pumped a predetermined pressure into the accumulator in its      hydraulic drive line. In the Minneapolis vehicle, on the      other hand, the engine's rpm is allowed to vary according      to the amount of pressure that is in the drive line's      accumulator and how fast that pressure is being drawn off      ... and the powerplant is almost never shut completely down      while the car is moving.    </p>    <p>      The two vehicles' speed control systems work differently      too. Any time the operator's foot is removed from the      accelerator in Vince's car, the automobile is automatically      put into a "braking mode". (The car is rapidly slowed down      as the turning of the rear wheels runs a pump which pushes      hydraulic fluid into the drive line's accumulator.) The      accelerator pedal on the HVTC machine, however, is pivoted      in the middle. When the driver pushes with his or her toe,      the car speeds up. Heel pressure throws the system into      braking mode and rapidly slows the vehicle down. And when      the operator removes his or her foot from the pedal      altogether, the car's drive system switches into a      freewheeling neutral, and the machine coasts.    </p>    <h3>      IS THE HVTC CAR IN YOUR FUTURE?    </h3>    <p>      Even though Ernie Parker's class fabricated its "car of the      future" from standard hardware that's available to any      family mechanic (or Detroit engineer) today, it's doubtful      that GM, Ford, or Chrysler will start cranking out carbon      copies of the HVTC automobile any time soon. If you want      one of the 75-mpg vehicles for your own use ... well,      you'll probably have to put it together yourself.    </p>    <p>      And maybe MOTHER will be able to help make that possible.      Naturally, a great deal of testing remains to be done on      the HVTC concept, the design will undoubtedly be refined as      time goes on, etc. But this magazine's editors intend to      monitor the work of Ernie Parker's group closely, do what      we can to help the engineering team hone and develop its      ideas ... and keep you informed of the progress that is      made. Perhaps, before too long, we'll even be able to offer      you plans that you can use in the construction of your own      75-mpg "car of the future".    </p>
