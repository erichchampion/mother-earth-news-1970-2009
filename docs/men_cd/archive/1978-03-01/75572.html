                        <p>      <em>Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves      from time to time, right? And almost everybody these days      wants to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a      little doit-yourself entertainment?</em>    </p>    <p>      And that's what this column is all about. Down-home music      that you can make ... and the instruments (which, in some      cases, you can also make!) to play that music on.    </p>    <p>      <em>We may also publish some songs, discuss music as a      potential home business, run discographies, bibliographies,      and/or include whatever other do-it-yourself music topics      you'd like to see.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The important thing is that this is a test column. If      you like it, write to me and let me know. If you have some      ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm open to any      suggestions or information you care to contribute. I'll      even try to answer your questions about down-home music ...      but-both for the benefit of all MOTHER's readers and to      ease my correspondence load?I'll deal with those questions,      whenever possible, here in this column ... rather than in      personal letters.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Address your correspondence?for this column and this      column only-to Marc Bristol, 31722 N.E. 180th Place,      Duvall, Wash. 98019.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>One way to save money and have a good time all at once      is by making your own music-and your own musical      instruments?at home. Here are a few ideas for doing just      that without spending a lot of cash ... or even going down      to the local music store!</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE GUTBUCKET    </h3>    <p>      Any homemade music-whether hammered out on the piano,      guitar, banjo, fiddle, or whatever?becomes more interesting      and more fun for everyone involved as more and more      instruments are added to the festivities. Especially if      those instruments contribute some tonal and rhythmic      coloring of their own. And one of the most basic of all the      additions you can make to any "pickin' and grinnin' " group      is the down-home washtub bass, or "gutbucket". Although the      instrument's strong suit is solid rhythmic accompaniment,      it can produce true notes (much to the amazement of      electric bass players!) and has a range of about an octave      and a half.    </p>    <p>      Start this construction project by scrounging up a No. 1 or      No. 2 washtub or similar large metal container. Don't      settle for one with its bottom rusted out because, for this      purpose, that bottom has to be strong. Buy a new tub if you      have to (and it won't break you, since a new No. 1 washtub      costs only about $15).    </p>    <p>      The neck for your gutbucket should be approximately 4-1/2      feet long and can be anything from a whittled-down hardwood      sapling to an old rake handle or even a piece of steel      conduit that is attached to the tub with a strap hinge.      Closet hanger dowel (1-1/4")?or an old oar--works real      well. The stronger the neck of your instrument, the better      . . . since lighter ones tend to absorb string vibration      and dampen a gutbucket's sound.    </p>    <p>      For that string (you only need one) I'd recommend starting      with plastic-coated, steel-core, nylon clothesline. It's      both the least expensive and the best, according to Quentin      Rhoton (the bass player in the accompanying picture). "It's      easy on your fingers," Quentin says, "that's why it's the      best. 'Course, you can use piano wire or a gut D-string      from a bass fiddle if you want to. Try anything you can      find that looks like it might work. Remember, though, that      resiliency is important: Your string has to stretch for the      higher notes and then spring back again. "    </p>    <p>      The string is attached to the center of the upside-down      washtub, usually by either one of two methods: [1] drill a      hole a little larger than the gutbucket's string in the      bottom of the tub, thread the string through the opening,      and knot the line on the other side to hold it in place, or      [2] bolt a small hasp or eyebolt to the center of the tub's      bottom and tie your string to it.    </p>    <p>      In either case, it's advisable to reinforce the inside of      the container's bottom with something like a peanut butter      jar lid, a circle of sheet metal, or a circle of 1/4"      plywood. You can cement the reinforcing disc in place or      just let the knotted string or eyebolt hold it there like a      big washer. It's also a good idea- if you use the knotted      string idea-to pass the line through a couple of fiber      washers first, then the reinforcing disc ... and to tape      the string where it passes through the tub's metal bottom      (all to protect the line from localized wear).    </p>    <p>      If you use a wooden pole for your gutbucket's neck, notch      its bottom end so it can be hooked on the little rim that      runs around the bottom of a washtub. Then bevel off the      side of the notch that faces the tub's bottom, so it won't      touch the metal (and dampen the tone) as the neck is leaned      back and forth during a song.    </p>    <p>      A hole a little larger than your string is then drilled      through the gutbucket's neck perpendicular to the notch on      the lower end and about five inches down from the top (to      leave you a nice handle to hold onto). If you don't feel      that you need that much handle, cut your stick three or      four inches shorter.    </p>    <p>      OK. Pass the string through the hole you've just drilled      and adjust it so that it just pulls taut when the line is      standing straight up and the stick is leaning over the tub.      Then wind that dude around the neck and tie it above the      hole and you're ready to play!    </p>    <p>      Hold the upturned washtub down by planting your foot (left      foot for southpaws, right for the rest of us) on its      opposite side. And make sure that foot rests only on the      tub's little rim ... otherwise you'll deaden the      gutbucket's sound.    </p>    <p>      Some players like to rest that far side of the tub on      something like a piece of 2 X 4 to let the sound out.      Others prefer to drill a 3/8" hole in the container's side.      Most all remove the washtub's handles so they won't rattle      in the middle of a hot song.    </p>    <p>      During your actual strummin', just pull back or let off on      the gutbucket's stick with one hand (to change the      instrument's tone) while you pluck that single string with      the other. And when you're ready to wail, make sure your      group tackles a song in which you get to play a solo!    </p>    <h3>      THE WASH BOARD    </h3>    <p>      This one is a natural for all you tabletop drummers. Any of      the metal boards will do, but a brass one has the best tone      in my opinion (forget glass boards for this use).    </p>    <p>      If you can't find a good metal washboard around the ole      homestead or up in your grandmother's attic, figure on      picking one up in a junk shop for $5. When I decided to      start playing this instrument I spread the word ... and      within months three good boards came at me all at once from      three different directions. If everything else fails, you      can still get yourself a nice new brass washboard from any      one of several mail-order stores that now handle oldtimey      items of this nature ... such as Morse Hardware Company,      1025 State St., Bellingham, Wash. 98225.    </p>    <p>      Then just latch onto some metal thimbles (they come in      several sizes), one for each finger, and start to "tap      dance" on that ole scrubboard. You may even want to buy a      couple of metal guitar thumb picks (or fashion your own      from a sheet of light metal) so your thumbs can dance too.      I've also seen gloves with thimbles sewed right onto every      finger and thumb (the thimbles can be a little looser when      you do it this way) which enables anyone who plays more      than one instrument to dazzle the audience with a display      of quick change artistry.    </p>    <p>      And if you want to dance and scrub out some rhythm at the      same time, just add a dandy neck strap to your board.      Cowbells, pans, tops, cymbals, wood blocks, bicycle horns,      or what have you can also be attached to a washboard to      give it greater versatility. The more different sounds you      have to experiment with, the more interesting and fun the      instrument is to play. I've even run across one board which      sported an old enameled urinal ... so visit the dump with      your thimbles on one of these days and conduct some "tune      tests" on all that lovely junk out there.    </p>    <p>      And don't feel (as some players do) that fast ragtime stuff      like "Coney Island Washboard" is the only music this      instrument should be turned loose on. Scrubboards are great      for bluegrass and I love to limber mine up on old rhythm      and blues tunes too. Try your board on anything.    </p>    <h3>      THE JUG    </h3>    <p>      You don't have to do anything to a jug to turn it into a      musical instrument except at least partly empty it. Old      ceramic molasses jugs (which, on occasion, have been known      to become filled with other beverages ... such as corn      liquor) are, of course, the most traditional for this use.      Any kind of jug-from a half- to five-gallon capacity-will      do the job though.    </p>    <p>      A jug is properly played something like a horn. That is,      you do not use your lips and mouth to produce an ordinary      "pop bottle whistle" noise. Instead, press your lips      tightly together and blow air through them to make sort of      a "motor boat" sound. The tone is then directed into the      container which resonates and amplifies it in somewhat the      same way a guitar body resonates and amplifies the sound of      that instrument's strings. Different tones can be produced      by both tightening and loosening the lips ... and by      blowing harder or softer. Experiment, too, with tipping      your jug up and down to change the angle at which you      direct your sound into it.    </p>    <p>      A good jug has a bass range that, to some degree, overlaps      the range of the washtub. Its sound is kind of a cross      between the pipe organ, the gutbucket, and the slide      trombone. The effect is both musical and humorous ... so      get some folks together, pass the jug around, everybody      practice his or her best tones, and see if you don't wind      up with a hilarious evening for all hands.    </p>    <h3>      THE KAZOO    </h3>    <p>      It doesn't take anything but a comb and some waxed paper to      make your traditional downhome kazoo. Simply wrap the paper      around the comb, press it to your lips, and hum a tune. You      can cup your hands (the way a harmonica player does) around      the instrument for a "wahwah" effect. Other papers and      techniques work too. Experiment.    </p>    <p>      If you want to get a little fancier, commercially made      kazoos are available from both music and toy stores      (they're usually less expensive at the toy shops). A few      kazoos played in harmony make a great reed and brass      section for any group of do-it-yourself musicians. And a      marching kazoo band can liven up a dead church social,      organization picnic, or other gathering when all else      fails.    </p>    <h3>      THE MUSICAL SAW    </h3>    <p>      Basically any handsaw will do ... but some are definitely      better than others and if you hunt around you're likely to      turn up a few that have been manufactured especially for      this purpose. In general the more pliable the saw you can      find, the better the music you'll be able to make.    </p>    <p>      You play this instrument by holding its handle against your      knee and bending its blade into an S-curve with one hand      while striking or bowing it with the other. Any convenient      rubbertipped striker is used in the first method, and a      violin bow is the obvious choice in the second. A saw's      tone is altered by using both wrist and knee pressure to      change the tension on the larger (lower) curve. The      resulting sound is similar to some of the modern      synthesized music that is so popular these days. I've also      heard the musical saw described as the "original pedal      steel".    </p>    <h3>      THE SPOONS    </h3>    <p>      We couldn't close this first column without mentioning the      spoons (yep, the ordinary kind you find in every kitchen      drawer). Hold two of 'em back-to-back loosely in one hand      with your index finger between the handles ... and let      their bowls rattle together as you beat the spoons against      your knee or between your other hand and the knee.    </p>    <p>      Interesting effects can also be obtained by playing a set      of spoons in front of your open mouth as you change the      size of the mouth cavity (sort of the way you do when you      play the jaw harp). In another sense, the spoons are a lot      like castanets ... and I have a friend who sometimes      switches off to a set of, handcarved wooden spoons, in      addition to playing all sorts of metal ones. Each set has a      sound all its own.    </p>    <h3>      LET'S GET STARTED!    </h3>    <p>      Quentin says a tub bass can be put together in as little as      15 minutes and I know it doesn't take even that long to get      started playing one. The other instruments described here      don't require any construction at all. Remember, too, that      there are still further possibilities: Anything that will      produce a sound becomes a musical instrument when it's      played rhythmically.    </p>    <p>      So what are you waiting for? A whole summer's worth of      bluegrass hoedowns, old-time fiddlers' conventions, plain      ordinary picnics, long evenings after the chores are all      done, and other get-togethers will be here before you know      it.    </p>    <p>      You don't have to be a professional to get in on this kind      of music. The fun part is just the gettin' together      (emphasis on the "together") with other musicians and      "jamming". Give everybody a chance to come up with a song      for the group to try ... and the older and the more      familiar some of those tunes are, the better. Even Oh      Suzanna or I've Been Working on the Railroad can be a real      thrill again when you play 'em on your own homegrown      instruments.    </p>
