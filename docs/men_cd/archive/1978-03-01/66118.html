                        <p>      At 26, Julie Jordan already has quite a number of      accomplishments to her credit. She's studied cooking at the      Cordon Bleu in London, and graduate nutrition and food      science at New York's Cornell University and at Cabrillo      College, California. She's then put what she's learned to      good use as a professional cook at the MacDowell Artists'      Colony in New Hampshire. And-in addition to teaching,      lecturing, and writing (the book from which the following      recipes are reprinted, for instance)-Ms. Jordan now      owns and operates a highly successful vegetarian      restaurant-the Cabbagetown Cafe-in Ithaca, New York.    </p>    <p>      Julie's quite intense about her chosen profession. "There's      a new kind of cooking, " she writes, "rising, bubbling,      sprouting in our land. It's strong cooking, based solidly      on foods the earth offers us. It's delicious cooking,      flavored with the spices and traditional ingredients of      many different cultures. But most of all, it's cooking      that's bursting with creativity and genuine enjoyment of      food. "    </p>    <p>      In keeping with those observations, there are many      excellent natural foods cookbooks available these days. But      Julie's Wings of Life is one of the few to offer-besides      recipes for appetizing breads and sauces and vegetable      dishes-directions for putting together some of the      most wonderful desserts we've seen anywhere. And it's six      of those marvelous meal-toppers that we've chosen as      examples of Julie's inspired culinary style.    </p>    <p>      Oh ... and-just in case you're wondering-Wings      of Life takes its name from a compliment once paid to one      of Julie's heavenly untested loaves: "Thanks for the bread.      That's not staff of life bread ... it's wings. "    </p>    <hr />    <p>      From Wings of Life: Vegetarian Cookery by Julie Jordan,      copyright 1976 by the author and reprinted with the      permission of The Crossing Press, Trumansburg, New York      14886. The book is available in paperback ($5.95) from any      good bookstore or from Mother's Bookshelf for $5.95 plus      95c shipping and handling.    </p>    <h3>      CONVERTING YOUR FAVORITE DESSERT RECIPES<br />      TO NATURAL INGREDIENTS    </h3><p>Cookie and pie recipes are in general easily converted    to natural ingredients. They'll simply be darker colored and    more flavorful. But cakes are tricky. You can't make a butter    cake recipe and substitute a liquid sweetening for the sugar.    It won't work, since butter and sugar must be creamed    together to beat in the air which is essential to the cake's    texture. Oil cakes, though (zucchini cake, carrot cake,    oatmeal cake, etc.), can be easily converted.</p>    <p>      I look first at the sweetening in a dessert recipe. White      sugar is out for nutritional reasons. Brown sugar is okay      if it's real, but commercial brown sugar in this country is      simply white sugar with a little molasses, artificial      color, and artificial flavor added. The sweeteners I use      are honey, maple syrup, molasses, and sorghum.    </p>    <p>      Honey is the most useful in making substitutions. (You can      use a little molasses with the honey for a      stronger-tasting, darker dessert.) But honey is      sweeter per volume than sugar. Therefore you can't      substitute honey for white sugar on a one-to-one basis.      You'll have to cut the quantity of honey down, say 3/4 cup      of honey to one cup of sugar. You should also adjust the      amount to your own taste ... I prefer even less sweetening      than 3/4 cup.    </p>    <p>      Since honey, maple syrup, sorghum, and molasses are      liquids, you should cut down the liquid called for in the      original recipe. If the recipe calls for one cup, reduce it      to 3/4 of a cup. This will prevent your dessert from being      dense and moist like pudding.    </p>    <p>      Desserts made with natural sweetenings will always brown      more on the surface than desserts with sugar because of the      chemical properties of the specific sugars they contain. To      prevent excessive browning, I decrease the recommended oven      temperature by 25??F, and bake the dessert slightly longer.    </p>    <p>      For the fat in any recipe I use butter, not margarine.      Sometimes I use tahini (a thin butter made by grinding      hulled sesame seeds) or peanut butter. In recipes calling      for oil, I use a good-flavored unrefined one. Peanut oil,      sesame oil, and corn germ oil taste especially good in      baked goods. (I think dessert recipes are normally too rich      as well as too sweet, so I cut back on the butter or oil      called for.)    </p>    <p>      I prefer baking soda to baking powder, since most baking      powders contain aluminum. When you use baking soda, you      must add an acid food to react with the soda and produce      carbon dioxide gas to leaven your dessert. (Baking powder      doesn't require such an addition, since it already contains      a material which releases carbon dioxide.) For one teaspoon      of baking powder in a recipe, substitute 1/2 teaspoon of      baking soda plus 1-1/2 teaspoons of lemon juice, or 1-1/2      teaspoons of vinegar, or use 1/2 cup of buttermilk in place      of 1/2 cup of milk.    </p>    <p>      Whole wheat pastry flour substitutes nicely for white flour      in all dessert recipes. Start out using an equal volume.      Since whole wheat pastry flours vary in their protein      content and thus in their ability to take up water,      however, be prepared to add extra flour if your batter      seems watery. Hard whole wheat flour (bread flour) can be      used for cakes, cookies, and pies. It will make a tougher,      more bready dessert.    </p>    <p>      Finally, I like to add lots of dried fruits and nuts to      after-dinner treats. Rather than apologizing for natural      ingredients, desserts can glory in them!    </p>    <h3>      STINA'S APPLE CAKE    </h3>    <p>      You won't believe how good this is.    </p>    <p>      2 big apples<br />      2 teaspoons cinnamon<br />      2 cups whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1 teaspoon baking soda<br />      1/2 cup butter (1/4 pound)<br />      3/4 cup honey<br />      1/2 cup buttermilk<br />      2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br />      1. Slice the apples and mix them with the cinnamon. Set      aside.    </p>    <p>      2. Mix the flour and baking soda. Using two forks or a      pastry blender, cut the butter into the flour until the      butter is in small pieces and evenly mixed.    </p>    <p>      3. Make a well in the center of the flour and butter, and      in the well mix the honey, buttermilk, and vanilla. Mix      them into the flour and butter, stirring just enough to      combine.    </p>    <p>      4. Butter a nine-inch cast-iron frying pan, or a nine-inch,      round, deep cake pan. Put in some batter, then a layer of      apples, then more batter. Continue layering until      everything is used up. End with batter on top. (Fill the      pan only 2/3 full. If you have extra batter and apples,      bake them in another pan.)    </p>    <p>      5. Bake in a 350??F oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until the      center of the cake is firm.    </p>    <p>      Yield: one nine-inch round cake    </p>    <h3>      GINGERBREAD    </h3>    <p>      A moist and tender dark-black gingerbread which is very      simple to make. Serve it with whipped cream or vanilla ice      cream. Or serve it with a big bowl of yoghurt fruit salad      for a summer dinner.    </p>    <p>      1/3 cup butter<br />      3/4 cup molasses<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      2 teaspoons baking soda<br />      1/2 cup buttermilk<br />      1 egg<br />      1/2 teaspoon sea salt<br />      2 teaspoons dry ginger<br />      2 cups whole wheat pastry flour<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Put the butter, molasses, and honey in a pot and cook      until they boil.    </p>    <p>      2. Remove from the heat, add the baking soda, and beat      vigorously with a wooden spoon.    </p>    <p>      3. Add the buttermilk and the egg. Then mix in the salt,      ginger, and flour.    </p>    <p>      4. Pour the batter into an assortment of buttered pans,      filling each about 2/3 full.    </p>    <p>      5. Bake in a 350??F oven for about 15 minutes, or until the      centers of the cakes are firm.    </p>    <p>      Variation: Use whole wheat bread flour and add one cup of      chopped raisins. This is more like bread, and is very good      with Cheddar cheese.    </p>    <p>      Yield: Serves six to eight    </p>    <h3>      MAPLE LACE COOKIES    </h3>    <p>      A delicate oatmeal cookie, with the rich flavor of maple      syrup.    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup butter (1/4 pound) 3/4 cup maple syrup 1 teaspoon      pure vanilla extract 1/2 teaspoon sea salt 1 teaspoon      baking soda 2 cups rolled oats 1- 1/2 cups whole wheat      pastry flour    </p>    <p>      1. Beat the butter with a wooden spoon until smooth. Add      the maple syrup and vanilla.    </p>    <p>      2. Mix in the salt and baking soda, then stir in the rolled      oats. Stir in flour and mix until smooth.    </p>    <p>      3. Drop the batter onto buttered cookie sheets with a      teaspoon. Leave the cookies plenty of room to spread out.    </p>    <p>      4. Bake in a 325??F oven for about 15 minutes, or until the      cookies are firm. Let the cookies cool a few minutes on the      trays to set before you remove them. Lace cookies have a      very fragile texture.    </p>    <p>      Yield: three to four dozen    </p>    <h3>      SESAME COOKIES    </h3>    <p>      Filled with the crunch of sesame seeds.    </p>    <p>      2 cups unhulled sesame seeds<br />      3/4 cup peanut butter<br />      1-1/2 cups honey<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice<br />      1 teaspoon pure vanilla extract<br />      1 teaspoon sea salt<br />      2 teaspoons baking soda<br />      3 cups whole wheat pastry flour<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Toast the sesame seeds in a frying pan or in the oven      until they're light brown.    </p>    <p>      2. Mix together the peanut butter and honey. Add the eggs,      lemon juice, and vanilla. Mix in the sesame seeds.    </p>    <p>      3. Mix in the salt and baking soda, then stir in the flour      and mix until smooth.    </p>    <p>      4. Drop the batter onto buttered cookie sheets with a      teaspoon.    </p>    <p>      5. Bake in a 325F oven for about 15 to 17 minutes, or until      the tops of the cookies start to brown.    </p>    <p>      Yield: five to six dozen    </p>    <h3>      HERMITS    </h3>    <p>      An orange, spicy, fruit and nut cookie.    </p>    <p>      1 cup tahini (see introduction)<br />      I cup honey<br />      2 tablespoons molasses<br />      3 eggs<br />      Grated rind of 2 oranges<br />      1-1/2 to 2 cups raisins<br />      1-1/2 to 2 cups chopped dates<br />      1-1/2 to 2 cups chopped walnuts<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      I teaspoon allspice<br />      1 teaspoon baking soda<br />      3 cups whole wheat pastry flour<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Mix together the tahini, honey, and molasses. Add the      eggs, orange rind, dried fruits, and nuts.    </p>    <p>      2. Mix in the spices and baking soda, then stir in flour      and mix until smooth.    </p>    <p>      3. Drop the batter onto buttered cookie sheets with a      teaspoon.    </p>    <p>      4. Bake in a 325°F oven for about 15 minutes, or until      the tops of the cookies start to brown. (These cookies are      best if they're soft after they're baked.) Loosen the      cookies from the pans immediately after removing from the      oven.    </p>    <p>      Yield: five to six dozen    </p>    <h3>      BAKED HONEY CUSTARD    </h3>    <p>      This custard has a delicate honey flavor. Serve it cool: It      tastes even better frosty cold than it does warm from the      oven.    </p>    <p>      6 eggs<br />      1/2 cup honey<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      4 cups milk<br />      2 teaspoons pure vanilla extract<br />    </p>    <p>      1. Whisk the eggs, honey, and salt together in a mixing      bowl.    </p>    <p>      2. Heat the milk, and add it slowly to the egg mixture,      whisking constantly.    </p>    <p>      3. Stir in the vanilla.    </p>    <p>      4. Pour the mixture into a casserole dish or into eight      individual custard cups.    </p>    <p>      5. Bake in a 350 °F oven for about one hour, or until      the custard is firm and a knife inserted in the center      comes out clean.    </p>    <p>      Variations: Sprinkle the top of the unbaked custard with      freshly grated nutmeg, stir grated fresh coconut into the      unbaked mixture, or drop slices of banana evenly over the      pre-oven custard (they'll float on top).    </p>    <p>      Yield: Serves eight.    </p>
