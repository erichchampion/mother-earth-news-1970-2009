                    <p>      "There may be an easier-to-construct, less expensive, more      aesthetic kind of horse corral than the one I chose to      build the spring before last," says Stan Flagg of Fort      Kent, Maine . . . "but I doubt it!"    </p>    <p>      Until you've been foiled by a footloose and fetter-free      animal who manages-time and again-to work his way through      all your fancy fences to go feed his face in greener      pastures, you can't appreciate the frustration our      wandering gelding used to cause us. We tried using an      electric fence . . . and it worked well during the summer,      but winter's white blanket insulated the ground so well in      the cold months that our usually equable equine quickly      forgot the shocks of summer and made a shambles of our      setup. Trailing strands of broken wire, he'd casually slog      from his private shed to the hay barn, where he'd then      spend the night munching and befouling.    </p>    <p>      I tried various schemes to make the electric fence      effective in snow ... but to no avail. Finally-with the      score at something like "Horse, 30 . . . Man, 0"?apoplexy      became the mother of invention. "There's got to be a better      way," I told myself. "I'm going to corral that horse if      it's the last thing I do!"    </p>    <h3>      A CORRAL FOR ALL SEASONS    </h3>    <p>      In my search for an answer to our "animal containment"      problem, I read George A. Martin's classic Fences, Gates,      and Bridges (available for $5.95 from any good bookstore or      for $5.95 plus 95 cents shipping and handling from Mother's      Bookshelf). After borrowing a few ideas here and there from      Martin's book and adding a few twists of my own, I      eventually came up with a horse holding design that I felt      I and my gelding could both live with: the "zig" corral.    </p>    <p>      And what's a "zig" corral? Nothing but a zigzag fence minus      the "zag" (see accompanying photographs). One advantage to      this design is that the use of upright posts set into the      ground is kept to a minimum: Our whole corral needed only      eight of them. This-of course-all but eliminates any worry      of rotting wood and/or frost heave ... and cut down on the      amount of time we had to spend digging post holes.    </p>    <p>      Another reason we chose the "zig" design is that it allowed      us to capitalize on the readily available aspen logs we'd      already felled in the course of our recent pasture-clearing      operation. Thus, our total out-of-pocket costs for the      project were essentially nil.    </p>    <p>      What we like most about our corral, however, is its      inherent sturdiness. The enclosure's sides are interlocked      in such a way that they could probably safely hold a      charging bull ... although, so far, the best we've been      able to come up 'with is one ornery horse.    </p>    <h3>      MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      We required the following materials to build a      semi-octagonal barrier about 48' in diameter:    </p><p>[1] thirty-five 6" to 8" X 15'6" peeled poles (for    rails)<br />    [2] ten 6" to 8" X 11'6" peeled poles (for rails)<br />    [3] ten 6" to 8" X 8' peeled poles (for rails)<br />    [4] eight 4" (or larger) X 10' peeled cedar or locust    posts<br />    [5] eighteen 6" X 6' boards (for rail binders)<br />    [6] thirty-two' 6" to 8" X 24" boards (for rail rests)<br />    [7] two 8" to 10" X 6' boards (for fence end caps)<br />    [8] two 7" X 6' boards (for gate end caps)<br />    [9] fourteen 6" to 8" X 6' boards (for rail blocks)<br />    [10] 600 common wire nails (12d <em>or</em> 3-1/4")    galvanized<br />    [11] four 8" spikes.<br /></p>    <p>      Skinning the logs was less of a problem than you might      think. Here in northern Maine, bark peels neatly off the      trees in the month of June (which is when we undertook the      construction of our corral). Both before and after this      time of year, though, the job seems to take ten times as      long. Even if we'd cut our trees during the previous year,      then, they'd have been easier to de-bark during the spring.    </p>    <p>      To strip the logs, I first ran the tip of my chain saw the      length of the timbers to slit their bark into 3"- or      4"-wide sections . . . then I skinned the poles with a      peeling spud (see MOTHER NO. 40, page 122 for information      on how to make one of these de-barking tools). Afterwards,      I allowed the slippery rails to dry for a few days before I      attempted to handle them again,    </p>    <h3>      LAYING THE GROUNDWORK FOR THE CORRAL    </h3>    <p>      While your posts and poles are drying, you can lay out the      ground plan of a corral like ours with a tape measure and      magnetic compass. We found that an angle of 30' between any      two sections of the fence works well. (Also- regardless of      how long your logs are-the distance between rail      intersections should be at least three feet less than the      length of the rails. Or, to say it another way, overlap      each joint a minimum of three feet.) Put one or two large,      flat rocks on the ground at each intersection point. These      foundation stones will hold the lowermost rails high enough      off the ground to discourage decay.    </p>    <p>      Next-at the fence ends and the gate opening-dig pairs of      postholes about three feet deep and 6" or 8" apart. (You      want them close enough so the cedar fenceposts that go into      the holes will hold the rails snugly.) As you can see in      Fig. 2, made allowance for an 18" walk-through where the      fence meets my shed. To do this, I placed the first pair of      postholes about 30" from the outbuilding. (A man can walk      through an 18" gap easily, but a horse can't.)    </p>    <p>      Now set the posts in their holes and place foundation      stones between or against them.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO ERECT THE CORRAL'S SIDES    </h3>    <p>      Starting at the walk-through, place a log on the first set      of base rocks. Check to make sure that the timber protrudes      far enough through the end posts so that it leaves less      than an 18" gap at the walk-through. (The excess will be      trimmed off later.)    </p>    <p>      OK. Working from the outside of the paddock, lay the small      end of the next log on the right end of the first log      (assuming you intend to work from left to right, or      counterclockwise, around the corral). Move around the      corral, setting the left end of each successive rail atop      the right end of the preceding one. (Hint: Always keep the      small end of each log to your left. The right end of each      log should rest on a foundation stone.) Complete the      circuit, but leave the gate area empty. (See Figs. 1 and      2.)    </p>    <p>      You may find it necessary to flatten the contact areas of      the poles to keep them from rolling. If so, have a friend      hold up the end of the upper rail as you do this (see Fig.      4). Also, as you build the fence higher, try to keep the      logs' centers of contact directly above the base rock      (or-if anything-tilted slightly toward the center of the      corral) and in a straight line. Eyeball accuracy is good      enough    </p>        <p>      Before you begin the second course of rails, nail pairs of      rail rests (the 6" X 24" boards mentioned under "Materials"      above) between all four sets of double fenceposts at right      angles to the rail just below, as shown in Fig. 3 and to      the far right of Fig. 5. (Nail additional pairs of the      rests to the posts every time a new course of rails is to      be put in place.)    </p>    <p>      Now-starting back at the walk-through-you can begin to lay      the second course of rails. Lay the left end of the first      log on top of the rail rests you've just installed and work      your way around the corral (counterclockwise as before),      again keeping the small end of each log to your left.    </p>    <p>      Continue to add courses in this fashion until the corral is      five courses (about five feet) high . . . or however high      you want it to go. Don't try to level the rails . . . the      finished corral will look better-and be more stable-if      you'll just follow the lay of the land.    </p>    <h3>      TYING IT ALL TOGETHER    </h3>    <p>      At this point, your enclosure may seem a little rickety,      but don't let that worry you. The purpose of the 6" X 6'      rail binders and rail blocks mentioned in the "Materials"      section above is to tie the whole structure together so      that- in the end -each log is held in place by the weight      of the entire corral.    </p>    <p>      Before you can attach the rail binders, it's necessary to      trim the projecting end of each overlong log. To do this,      first tack a 6"-long board vertically to one row of      protruding rail ends (Fig. 5) to serve as a saw guide ...      then run your chain saw down the side of the board to trim      the row of logs. (Angle the cut slightly, as shown in Fig.      3.)    </p>        <p>      Now place a 6" X 6' rail binder flat against the sawed-off      ends of the five stacked rails. If the fit is good and snug      (some extra work with the chain saw may be necessary), nail      the board to the rail ends. Cut off any remaining sharp      edges (Fig. 3). Continue to trim rail ends and apply binder      boards all the way around the corral.    </p>    <p>      Next, attach 6" X 6 ' "rail blocks" vertically to the sides      of the rails at the fence ends (Figs. 3 and 7). Use the      outermost blocks as guides to saw off rail projections. (At      the walkthrough, you should trim enough wood from the logs      to create an 18" gap between the fence and the shed or      obstacle next to it.) Notice (Fig. 6) that at the gate      opening, one Tail block is omitted on each side of the      opening. Except for this, the gateway is finished in      exactly the same manner as the fence ends.    </p>        <p>      Now nail the fence end caps and gate end caps (items 7 and      8 under "Materials" above) to the corral as shown in Figs.      3 and 6.    </p>    <p>      Finally, spike the corral's four outer posts to the      uppermost row of rails at the fence ends and gateway, using      8"-long spikes.    </p>    <h3>      THE GATE    </h3>    <p>      It's possible, of course, to fit your corral with any of      several dozen types of gates (see George A. Martin's book      for ideas along this line.) I decided to make a simple      balance gate of the type described on pages 137-138 of      Martin's Fences, Gates, and Bridges. Figure 6 pretty much      tells the story. (Notice that my gate opens into the      corral.)    </p>    <p>      If you decide to go the balance-gate route, don't try to      build the whole gate on the ground before hanging it. It's      much easier (in my experience) to put the hinge and balance      beam up first, and add the rest of the gate (which consists      of nothing but a framework of eight or ten boards nailed to      a couple of hardwood poles, as shown in Fig. 6) afterwards.      If the balance beam isn't exactly straight, be sure to turn      it so that it curves upward (for plenty of clearance over      the rails).    </p>    <p>      One other suggestion: You may find it useful-as we have -to      leave a 12" gap between the bottom of the gate and the      ground, so you can open the gate easily in icy and snowy      conditions.    </p>    <h3>      THAT'S IT!    </h3>    <p>      That's all there is to building a "zig" corral. When you're      finished you'll have a massive, super-strong, low-cost,      maintenance-free structure that's aesthetically pleasing      and (more important) very safe for its animal occupants (no      sharp corners or protrusions to mangle your heedless horse      or clumsy cattle). More important still is the fact that      the complete enclosure is-for all intents and purposes      -completely unbreachable: Even the most cunning equine      (Fig. 8) will be unable to escape the confines of this      enclosure    </p>        <p>      I'm no expert when it comes to fences and corrals, but if      there's a better-looking, less expensive, more effective      way to put an uppity horse in his place (and keep him      there) ... I haven't seen it!    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      PHOTOS 1,4 BY W. SCHAFFER, PHOTOS 5, 7 BY THE AUTHOR, PHOTO      8 BY L. SCHAFFER    </h5>
