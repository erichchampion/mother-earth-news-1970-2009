                		<p><strong>Wasting illness may travel via game farms.</strong>		</p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Brian McCombie    </h5>        <p>      The first U.S. mad cow was diagnosed just last year, but      for more than 30 years, deer in certain parts of this      country are known to have been afflicted by a similar fatal      neurological ailment called chronic wasting disease (CWD).      Twenty years ago, the same illness was diagnosed in elk.    </p>    <p>      In the past nine years, possibly as a consequence of game      farm practices, CWD in deer and elk has spread from two      states to 10 more and two Canadian provinces. Hunters in      certain areas now are being urged to have their deer and      elk kills tested.    </p>    <p>      For 30 years, CWD in the wild was centered in portions of      northeast Colorado and southeast Wyoming. Since 1997, it      has turned up in the wild in Nebraska, South Dakota,      Wisconsin, Illinois, New Mexico, Utah and Saskatchewan,      too.    </p>    <p>      Game farms also have had the disease appear, and many      suspect that animal sales between farms, as well as      escapees, helped transport the disease.    </p>    <p>      From 1996 to 2002, CWD was discovered on game farms in      Saskatchewan, Alberta, Colorado, Kansas, Minnesota,      Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma and South Dakota. Overall,      there are about 12,000 deer and elk farms in the U.S. and      Canada.    </p>    <p>      Several years ago, three young people - two hunters      and one woman who ate venison hunted by her father -      died of the human form of CWD, Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease      (pronounced Croytz-feld Yawkob), and scientists are      wondering if humans could be infected by eating venison      from sick deer or elk.    </p>    <p>      The jury's out on this all-important question, though      research is ongoing. Dr. Patrick Bosque, a neurologist with      the hospital Denver Health, has been studying CWD for many      years. He says, "The most prudent assumption is that, at      some low rate, if enough people consume enough      chronic-wasting-disease meat, some people might get a      chronic-wastinglike disease. But we really don't know for      sure.'    </p>    <p>      <strong>First, mad sheep</strong>    </p>    <p>      Nearly 300 years ago, European herders noticed a new      affliction among their sheep. Some of the animals suddenly      would become disorientated and nervous, grind their teeth      and bite at their legs and feet. Many displayed a maddening      itch, rubbing themselves bloody against fence posts. Within      six months, they would stop eating and die. Herders dubbed      the disease "scrapie.'    </p>    <p>      Today, microscopic examination of scrapie-infected sheep      brains reveals the calling card of this family of diseases:      extremely tiny ruptures or holes in the brain cells.      Imagine a normal, solid section of brain cells and, next to      it, a scrapie-infected section that looks strangely      swiss-cheesed. Both mad cow (bovine spongiform      encephalopathy or BSE) and CWD have this similar abnormal      brain-cell pathology.    </p>    <p>      In 1977, Elizabeth Williams, a graduate student in      veterinary medicine, discovered these miniscule holes; in      1980, she published her findings. Williams was trying to      figure out why deer and elk were dying at the Foothills      Wildlife Research Facility, now operated by the Colorado      Division of Wildlife, near Fort Collins, Colo.    </p>    <p>      In the 1960s, Foothills and three similar Colorado research      facilities had embarked on several studies involving wild      deer and elk; when the projects were completed, the animals      were released back into the wild.    </p>    <p>      Soon after the studies began, however, the deer began dying      from a mysterious ailment. Many slobbered excessively,      became listless and stopped interacting with other animals.      Some would tremble and become uncoordinated. Usually, they      would grow emaciated and waste away, their ribs protruding      painfully before they died.    </p>    <p>      The area encompassing Foothills also was home to sheep with      scrapie, which has existed in North America since 1947;      some researchers think scrapie from the sheep was      contracted by the deer and elk. Michael Miller, a Colorado      Division of Wildlife veterinarian at the Foothills      facility, says the disease may have existed in the wild      even earlier, and then spread from infected animals brought      in for study to the closely confined captive animals. Other      experts say not enough proof exists to support either idea.    </p>    <p>      Williams, now a professor of veterinary science at the      University of Wyoming and a leading CWD researcher, says      today the disease is present in "about 40,000 square miles      of Colorado, Nebraska and Wyoming. The known CWD-affected      area took a big jump in 2002-2003, moving farther to the      west and north in Wyoming." And the rate of infection is      picking up, too, Williams says. Tests done in the 1980s in      Colorado estimated less than 1 percent of elk and 2 percent      or less of deer had CWD; today, in pockets of Colorado and      Wyoming, the average infection rate in deer is 7 percent to      8 percent and, in a few areas, more than 15 percent have      tested positive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Captive Victims</strong>    </p>    <p>      According to Valerius Geist, professor emeritus of      environmental science at the University of Calgary, there      is no more efficient way to spread a wildlife disease than      by transporting infected animals to disease-free areas. A      respected wildlife biologist and author of numerous books      on deer and elk biology, Geist says the trade in game farm      animals has spread CWD into the wild across North America.      "Deer are notorious for getting in and out of these farms,"      he says, noting fences fall down or are breached by severe      weather, and gates are left open. At fence lines, wild      animals can have nose-to-nose contact with their fenced-in      counterparts.    </p>    <p>      Game farm animals also are confined at much higher      concentrations than in the wild, Geist says, and this      concentration allows diseases like chronic wasting to      magnify. In the 1990s, he adds, game-farmed elk introduced      another disease, bovine tuberculosis, into Canadian cattle      and other animals, a development that has cost Canadian      taxpayers and consumers millions of dollars.    </p>    <p>      In 1996, Saskatchewan discovered its first game farm animal      with CWD, an elk. By 2001, the province had 29 game farms      under quarantine, and eventually, nearly 8,000 elk were      slaughtered, more than 100 of which tested positive for      CWD.    </p>    <p>      George Luterbach, chief veterinarian for the western branch      of the Canadian Food Inspection Agency and one researcher      involved in the elk situation, says, "We think we traced      back most of the chronic wasting disease exposures to a      single elk from South Dakota." Later, CWD was found on the      South Dakota farm where the elk was raised. Luterbach says      he thinks this single South Dakota elk brought the disease      to the first infec- ted Saskatchewan game farm, that then      distributed the disease into other game farm operations      through buying and selling animals.    </p>    <p>      In 2000, Saskatchewan also recorded its first wild deer      with CWD, and Darrel Rowledge, director of a Calgary      conservation group called the Alliance for Public Wildlife,      says it was no coincidence that CWD was found in the wild a      few years after being confirmed on game farms. Given that      the prions (misfolded, nerve cell-killing proteins) that      cause CWD are very difficult to destroy and the disease is      always fatal, historical and scientific records should      reveal a pre-1960 presence in the wild in North America,      but they don't. So, Rowledge says, the disease was      localized in Colorado until infected game farm animals      dispersed it more widely.    </p>    <p>      'Scientists knew that privatization, domestication and      commercialization of wildlife were going to cause      horrendous disease problems," Rowledge says, "but many      state legislatures and agricultural agencies legalized game      farms in the 1970s and 1980s, anyway. There was this      presumption that [game farmers] should be allowed to exist      until it was proven that they were doing something wrong."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marching east</strong>    </p>    <p>      In February 2002, Wisconsin shocked the wildlife world when      its Department of Natural Resources (DNR) announced that      three deer killed by hunters the previous November had      tested positive for CWD. This was the first known incidence      of the disease east of the Mississippi River.    </p>    <p>      The three animals were killed near Mount Horeb, in      southwestern Wisconsin, about 20 miles west of Madison, the      state capital. Wisconsin subsequently embarked on a plan to      kill off as many deer as possible in the surrounding      960-square-mile area. Since then, Wisconsin has identified      320 infected deer, most killed and tested during      deer-hunting seasons. Just south of the Wisconsin border in      Illinois, 30 more infected deer were identified between      November 2002 and December 2003.    </p>    <p>      No one knows for sure how CWD jumped over 800 miles, from      Colorado to Wisconsin. But, according to DNR secretary      Scott Hassett, several possibilities exist, including      infected deer [being] brought into the Mount Horeb area and      released; infected deer escaping from a deer farm;      hunter-harvested deer brought back from the West and      carcass remains being left on the landscape; and CWD prions      fed to wild deer in deer food or mineral blocks. "People      would have been unaware that CWD was present in all of the      above scenarios," Hassett says, "yet these situations all      have something in common - a human activity that      poses the risk of unknowingly introducing a devastating      disease."    </p>    <p>      "I wouldn't eat an animal from an area with chronic wasting      disease unless it had been tested."<br />      <em><strong>- Dr. Patrick Bosque</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      At the time CWD was discovered in the state, more than 700      Wisconsin deer and elk farms were holding more than 16,000      animals. A 2000 series of investigative reports by this      writer in the Madison, Wis., weekly newspaper, Isthmus,      revealed some of those farms had imported more than 350 elk      from game farms in Western states where CWD is found in the      wild or from other farms with ties to game farms where      stock had tested positive for the disease.    </p>    <p>      In September 2003, a deer with CWD was identified on a      Wisconsin game farm, and by January of this year, 16      Wisconsin game farms were under CWD quarantines.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Victims in every arena</strong>    </p>        <p>      'We were always certain that the science would show we are      not the source of this problem, that we are as much a      victim of this disease as anyone else," says Gary Nelson,      who owns a deer farm near Fence, Wis. Nelson also is      president of the Whitetails of Wisconsin Association, an      industry group that represents 200 of the state's 487 deer      farmers. Another 350 Wisconsin game farmers raise elk or      exotic deer. (Game farms raise deer and elk for paid      hunting, meat and antler velvet, which is sold to exotic      markets.)    </p>    <p>      Nelson says Wisconsin game farmers very much wanted to keep      chronic wasting out of the state, and worked with Wisconsin      agricultural officials to devise a CWD program four years      ago. That program was put into effect under emergency      authority after CWD was found in the state and is now      standard operating procedure for all Wisconsin game      farmers. Among the regulations, every dead deer or elk that      leaves a game farm must be tested, no matter how it died.    </p>    <p>      He says game farms could have introduced CWD to Wisconsin,      but the vast majority of infected animals - more than      300 - have been found in the wild. Less than 20      infected deer and elk out of nearly 6,000 tested since 2002      have been discovered on Wisconsin game farms. "Yes, we have      it on game farms," he says, "but if it originated here, we      would've discovered it rampant on Wisconsin game farms. And      we haven't."    </p>    <p>      Elk appear the least susceptible to CWD, with mule deer      (Western cousin of the white-tailed deer) next, followed by      the white-tails, which are considered the most susceptible      and the most responsible for spreading the illness. The      exact route of infection between animals isn't known, but      Colorado's Miller says it appears to be introduced orally.      The possibility is that infected deer and elk somehow      "shed" infected prions, passing them on to other animals      through activities like feeding together, touching noses or      stepping in each others" feces and urine. Currently, most      scientists say the disease is fatal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Management By Eradication</strong>    </p>    <p>      In Wisconsin, with deer densities of up to 70 animals per      square mile, wildlife officials worry CWD could devastate      the entire herd. Initially, the Wisconsin DNR wanted to      eradicate all deer in the area with the disease; then, the      agency shifted to a more practical, massive reduction      effort via increased hunting. The aim is to slow the spread      of infection.    </p>    <p>      Yet many Wisconsin citizens oppose the DNR's plan. One      group, called CAIDS or Citizens Against Irrational Deer      Slaughter, argues the mass kill plan is worse than the      disease itself. The group has enlisted landowners willing      to prohibit hunting on their properties for the cause.    </p>    <p>      Veterinarian John Barnes, a CAIDS organizer, says many      healthy deer will be slaughtered needlessly. Barnes also      thinks a deer kill would deprive future wild deer      generations of potentially CWD-resistant genes, which could      go a long way towards providing natural protection against      CWD in the future.    </p>    <p>      So far, the only plan in Wisconsin, and Colorado, is to      kill more deer. Tom Hauge, chief of the Wisconsin DNR's      Wildlife Division, says new "intensive harvest zones"      likely will be in place for this year's hunt, but he adds,      "We are focused on eradicating the disease, not the deer.'    </p>    <p>      In Colorado and Wyoming, individual hunters can have their      deer and elk tested for CWD. In Colorado, the cost is $15;      in Wyoming, it's $25. Other states don't yet offer testing      to individuals, though they are sampling for the disease in      areas where CWD-infected animals have been found; in      Wisconsin, mandatory sampling is under way in areas with      known CWD-infected deer or elk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Federal Assistance?</strong>    </p>    <p>      John Stauber, food safety activist and co-author of Mad Cow      U.S.A.: Can the Nightmare Happen Here? (Common Courage,      1997), says he thinks the federal government needs to take      a leading role in fighting CWD. "We need a major and      well-funded scientific investigation to determine exactly      how widespread chronic wasting disease, mad cow and scrapie      are in North America," he says, noting only the federal      government has the resources and regulatory control to      conduct such work. In May 2002, Rep. Scott McInnis of      Colorado's 3rd District held hearings on CWD and last year      introduced a bill to create an interagency plan to deal      with the disease. In 2003, nearly $13 million in federal      funds also was given to states to help fight CWD, and the      U.S. Department of Agriculture is working on a national      management plan, too. Meanwhile, the single case of mad cow      in Washington state caused President Bush to ask for an      additional $60 million in fiscal year 2005 for mad cow      surveillance and research. The difference in federal      responses, Stauber says, reflects a large blind spot at top      governmental levels. "Chronic wasting disease is still seen      as a hunting industry, game farm or natural resources      management problem, and very much a state issue. I think      it's part of a much bigger national TSE (Transmissible      Spongiform Encephalopathy, a disease category that includes      mad cow, CWD and scrapie) problem, and needs to be treated      that way.'    </p>    <p>      Brian McCombie lives in Wisconsin and writes about wildlife      and environmental issues.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Is Venison Safe to Eat?</em></strong>    </p>        <p>      Chronic wasting disease (CWD), scrapie, mad cow and the      human Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease are Transmissible      Spongiform Encephalopathies or TSEs, in which a normal      brain cell protein called "the prion protein" builds up in      a misfolded form that kills nerve cells.    </p>    <p>      Creutzfeldt-Jakob symptoms are similar to Alzheimer's, and      include memory loss and depression, followed by rapidly      progressive dementia and death, usually within a year after      symptoms appear. The lag time between contracting the      disease and death is not yet known.    </p>    <p>      Although Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease is rare, the deaths of      three young people from the disease caught the attention of      the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)      because all three - two hunters, from Utah and      Oklahoma, and a woman from Maine who ate hunted venison as      a child - were younger than 30 when they first      displayed symptoms. The median age at death from      Creutzfeldt-Jakob is 68.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Patrick Bosque of the hospital Denver Health says      humans have about a 1-in-15,000 lifetime chance of      contracting Creutzfeldt-Jakob. He doesn't think humans are      highly susceptible to CWD, citing the disease's presence in      portions of Colorado and Wyoming for more than 30 years,      with untold numbers of CWD-infected deer and elk consumed      by hunters and their friends and family during that time.    </p>    <p>      Research by Denver Health and Colorado State University      hasn't detected an increase in Creutzfeldt-Jakob cases in      northeastern Colorado, either, something Bosque says would      occur if humans were even moderately susceptible to chronic      wasting.    </p>    <p>      'On the other hand," he says, "if you look at the situation      in England, people aren't very susceptible to mad cow,      either.'    </p>    <p>      Bosque says humans most at risk of contracting mad cow and      CWD have some genetic predisposition to the diseases      - a predisposition not yet understood. "That doesn't      mean people shouldn't hunt deer," he says, "but they      probably should get it tested. I wouldn't eat an animal      from an area with chronic wasting disease unless it had      been tested.'    </p>    <p>      By 2003 in North America, nearly all states and provinces      had at least some testing for CWD available, though the      tests are not considered 100-percent accurate.    </p>
