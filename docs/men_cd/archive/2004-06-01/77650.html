                        <p>      The bald eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is unique to      North America and was once widespread. In 1782, when it was      chosen as our national bird, there were as many as 100,000      eagles in what would become the lower 48 states and 300,000      throughout North America. Then, habitat destruction and      widespread use of the pesticide DDT pushed the bald eagle      toward extinction, with only 417 breeding pairs remaining      in the lower 48 states in 1963. Thanks to a national      conservation and recovery effort, that population has now      rebounded to more than 7,000 pairs.<br />    </p>
