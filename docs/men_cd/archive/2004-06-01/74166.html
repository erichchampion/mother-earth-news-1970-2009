                		<p><em>Explore the options and choose what's right for you.</em>	</p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Michael Castleman    </h5>        <p>      <strong>T</strong>hirty years ago, conventional and complementary health      practitioners were calling each other nasty names and      dismissing each other's treatments as useless or dangerous.      These days, many complementary health care practitioners      are willing to admit that for emergency medicine,      conventional treatments usually are the best option.      Meanwhile, conventional doctors are embracing diet changes,      exercise and stress management as valuable complements to      medical care and are more willing to accept other holistic      therapies as valid treatments. Because of this growing      acceptance, many people are finding they don't have to      choose between complementary or conventional medicine, but      can have the best of both.    </p>    <p>      So where should you turn for your health care needs? The      truth is that most medical treatment begins in the same      place. Think of health care as a ladder, with each rung      representing another option. The first rung should be      self-care, when you decide whether the aspirin - or      willow bark - in your medicine cabinet will be enough      to make you feel better, or if you might have a more      serious problem.    </p>    <p>      If self-care doesn't provide sufficient relief, the next      rung should be conventional medicine, which is usually best      for diagnosing serious conditions. Initially, that's what      you need: a clear idea of how minor, or major, your problem      is. If it's serious, you need to get that information as      soon as possible so you can begin treating the problem. If      it's minor, then you're free to decide which steps on up      the ladder to take: conventional, complementary or a      combination of the two.    </p>    <p>      Many people feel most comfortable with conventional      medicine, which certainly is successful at treating many      health problems. But even if you decide to go this route,      it's important to take an active interest in your medical      care. Doctors have embraced many lifestyle treatments, but      they still usually rely on drugs and surgery, both of which      carry their own risks. Before accepting any prescription,      be sure you understand all of the drug's possible side      effects. Ask your doctor, and then ask the pharmacist who      fills your prescription. You also might check a consumer      health Web site, such as www.webmd.com. Before opting for      surgery, get more than one opinion.    </p>    <p>      If you're new to complementary therapies, you'll find any      number of reasons to consider giving them a try. For some      conditions, herbal medicines can have the same result as a      conventional prescription, but with fewer side effects.      Holistic treatments also can be an especially good choice      for treating stress-related diseases, as well as for      managing chronic pain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Traditional Treatments</strong>    </p>        <p>      Scientists have been paying more attention to holistic      medicine recently, but these treatments aren't exactly      breaking news. Many have a long history of use, and are      still being practiced around the world. Three of the most      widely available forms of holistic medicine in the United      States are herbalism, naturopathy and Chinese medicine, all      traditional treatments.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Herbalism.</strong> Herbs continue to impact modern      medicine - an estimated 25 percent of drugs derive      directly or indirectly from plants. Herbal medicines are      used extensively in naturopathy, and various traditional      medicines. In addition, independent of these healing arts,      some practitioners call themselves "herbalists." They      typically prescribe herbal teas or tinctures (herb essences      prepared by steeping herbs in alcohol) for a variety of      everyday ills, among them, constipation, premenstrual      syndrome (PMS), insomnia, anxiety, lethargy and weakened      immune systems.    </p>    <p>      Hundreds of studies show that herbal medicines treat many      conditions. Recently, Korean researchers gave a placebo or      ginseng (900 milligrams three times a day) to 45 men with      erectile dysfunction. The ginseng group experienced      significant improvement. In another study published in      2002, Australian researchers gave 126 people with chronic      dandruff an ordinary shampoo or one containing 5 percent      tea tree oil. Tea tree oil is a potent herbal antiseptic      that kills the fungus that causes dandruff. After four      weeks, flaking improved 41 percent in the tea tree group,      and only 11 percent in the plain-shampoo group.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Naturopathy.</strong> This branch of holistic      medicine was practiced widely during the 19th century in      Europe and the United States, and despite the more recent      dominance of conventional medicine, it has never      disappeared. Naturopaths have a Western scientific      understanding of the body, and treat illness with a      combination of diet changes, hot baths, and medicinal herbs      or herb-derived drugs.    </p>    <p>      Consulting a naturopath is similar to seeing a conventional      doctor. Naturopaths typically take the same type of medical      history and perform a physical exam. Different naturopaths      have different therapeutic proclivities. Some favor      supplements or herbs; others prefer Chinese medicine.    </p>    <p>      Naturopaths helped develop the modern pharmaceutical      industry, being among the first to extract medicinal      compounds from herbs. Ironically, the pharmaceutical      industry turned to synthetic drugs, which eclipsed      naturopathy and just about put it out of business. Most      physicians embraced pharmaceuticals, but a small group,      mainly in the Pacific Northwest, continued to prescribe      more natural treatments. In recent years, disenchantment      with drug side effects has spurred a naturopathy revival.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Chinese medicine.</strong> Mention Chinese medicine      and most people think of acupuncture, which is based on the      idea that life energy, or Qi, flows around the body along      invisible pathways called meridians. Qi flows freely      through a healthy body, but illness comes from a blocked      energy flow. Acupuncture treatments counter this problem by      releasing blocked energy to restore health.    </p>    <p>      Western physicians remain skeptical of Qi and the meridian      theory, but there is no denying that acupuncture works for      many conditions, especially pain problems. In a 2002 study,      Swedish researchers gave 90 women in labor either standard      anesthesia or acupuncture instead of or in addition to the      standard treatment. The acupuncture group reported      significantly less labor pain.    </p>    <p>      Other recent studies show that acupuncture helps treat      urinary tract infections, infertility, arthritis and even      cocaine addiction. Assuming the needles are sterilized,      acupuncture also is remarkably safe. In 1997, officials      with the National Institutes of Health concluded: "The data      in support of acupuncture are as strong as those for many      accepted Western medical therapies. ... [and] the      occurrence of adverse events has been documented to be      extremely low."    </p>    <p>      In addition to acupuncture, Chinese medicine also makes      extensive use of diet changes and herbal medicines based on      a philosophy completely distinct from Western medicine.      Traditional Chinese medical practitioners make diagnoses      based on what they hear, see and feel, without the aid of      high-tech, Western-style diagnostic tests; many diagnoses      are made by studying the patient's pulse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Relaxation therapies</strong>    </p>        <p>      Some of the most common complementary treatments are      methods to help you relax. These therapies can be a good      entry point into holistic medicine if you don't let their      simplicity fool you into thinking they won't be effective.    </p>    <p>      The effects stress has on health are well documented. For      those who are already ill, anxiety aggravates symptoms,      particularly pain. Anxiety also causes or contributes to      many health conditions, including asthma, insomnia,      headaches, low back pain and upset stomach. For any of      these ailments, relaxation therapies can provide      significant relief by reducing anxiety.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Meditation.</strong> Until the 1970s, most      Americans viewed meditation as something Indian gurus did      on remote mountain tops. Then Harvard cardiologist Herbert      Benson showed that the profound relaxation produced by      meditation emerged not from religious experience, but      rather from natural, easily accessible physiological      changes. His 1975 best seller, The Relaxation Response,      secularized meditation and popularized it in the United      States.    </p>    <p>      Today, meditative breathing and mental focus exercises have      been incorporated into everything from childbirth classes      to diabetes education, and studies show meditation not only      helps control anxiety and pain, but also can boost the      immune system. Though meditation can have a powerful effect      on your health, it's one therapy that doesn't require the      supervision of a health professional. All that's necessary      to meditate is taking the time to sit quietly and empty      your mind by focusing on your breathing or on a single word      or phrase, called a mantra. Work up to 20 minutes a day      over a few months.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Massage.</strong> Even a simple back or shoulder      rub can be relaxing, but it's really no substitute for a      professional massage, which works wonders on stress and      muscle tension. Several studies have shown massage can      produce remarkable health benefits. In a 1998 study at the      University of Miami's Touch Research Institute (TRI),      researchers had the parents of 32 children with severe      asthma either coach relaxation exercises or give 20-minute      massages. After 30 days, children who received the massage      treatment had significantly easier breathing compared to      the other group. A TRI study conducted in 2000 found that      massage helps relieve PMS.    </p>    <p>      If you've never had a professional massage, here's what to      expect. At an appointment, you typically lie on a padded      table in a warm room, wearing only underwear and covered by      a sheet. The two main schools of massage are Swedish and      deep-tissue. Swedish massage involves long, gliding strokes      or muscle kneading. Deep-tissue massage presses into muscle      and connective tissue. Neither Swedish massage nor      deep-tissue work should hurt, but the latter can feel      intense. If intensity crosses over into pain, say so, and      the masseuse will ease the pressure. Swedish massage      therapy uses lotion, scented with aromatic plant oils, to      help the practitioners" hands glide more smoothly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Biofeedback.</strong> Another door into deep,      meditative relaxation is biofeedback. Effective for      relaxing specific muscle groups, biofeedback involves small      machines with visual displays that look like speedometers.      Say you suffer from tension headaches, a condition caused      by chronic muscle tension in the head, neck and shoulders.      At a biofeedback office, you sit in a chair, and the      trainer pastes small tension-sensing electrodes to the      muscles that need to relax. The dial on the visual display      shows you how tense those muscles are. As you relax, the      dial moves. Using meditative deep breathing and conscious      relaxation, it usually doesn't take long before people can      move the dial into the deep-relaxation zone. Eventually      biofeedback clients can dispense with the machinery and      relax their muscles as needed.    </p>    <p>      Biofeedback helps treat a variety of conditions, including      migraine headaches and constipation (a prevalent medical      condition).    </p>    <p>      In a 2000 study at Cincinnati Children's Hospital, 20      children with migraines, average age 11, used biofeedback      to control their headaches. Five months later, their      migraines were significantly less frequent and severe.    </p>    <p>      Researchers at the University of Iowa use biofeedback to      teach chronic constipation sufferers to relax their anal      sphincters. In a recent study involving 80 patients, the      training helped all of them, and a year later, 90 percent      continued to report benefits.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOMEOPATHY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Homeopathy is one of the most controversial complementary      therapies because it's Western, yet it defies the known      laws of chemistry, physics and pharmacology. No one knows      how or why it works - neither homeopaths who swear by      it, nor conventional doctors, many of whom often swear at      it.    </p>    <p>      Homeopathy was the brainchild of a German doctor, Samuel      Hahnemann (1755-1843), who became disenchanted with the      treatments typical of 18th-century medicine: bleeding,      mercury, powerful laxatives (cathartics) and drugs that      induced vomiting (emetics). He correctly believed that      these treatments did more harm than good. Hahnemann did not      reject all of the then-standard treatments. He was      impressed with several, including cinchona bark, the first      effective treatment for malaria (and source of the      antimalarial drug quinine). In 1790, Hahnemann ingested      some cinchona bark, and quickly felt cold, achy, anxious,      thirsty and ill - the symptoms of malaria. That      experience led him to postulate his Law of Similars, the      idea that illnesses can be treated with the substances that      cause the same symptoms in healthy people.    </p>    <p>      Hahnemann tested hundreds of substances on himself -      herbs, minerals, animal parts - and catalogued their      effects. Eventually, he began treating people      homeopathically, and attracted a large following. Hom-      eopathy came to the United States in the 1830s and quickly      won many supporters, including Daniel Webster, John D.      Rockefeller and Mark Twain.    </p>    <p>      But conventional medicine vilified it, largely because of      Hahnemann's Law of Potentization that says homeopathic      medicines grow stronger as they are diluted. This defied      the dose-response principle of pharmacology, which says the      larger the dose, the greater the effect. But starting in      the mid-1970s, interest in complementary therapies,      including homeopathy, took off again.    </p>    <p>      Among the research showing homeopathic treatments can be      beneficial is a 1994 study conducted in Nicaragua by      researchers from the University of Washington, Seattle.      They treated 81 children younger than age 5 with infectious      diarrhea, a major cause of childhood death worldwide. Half      received standard treatment (rehydration fluid), while half      received rehydration fluid plus a homeopathic medicine. The      homeopathy group experienced significantly faster recovery.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Check Credentials and Cost</strong>    </p>    <p>      Finding an appropriate branch of complementary medicine is      only the first step. You'll need to do some additional      research to find an affordable, qualified therapist. It's      possible that your current doctor may have some experience      in holistic medicine or at least may be able to provide a      referral. If not, a number of professional organizations      can refer you to a qualified holistic therapist (see      "Complementary Credentials," below, for help deciphering      qualifications, and "Natural Doctor Directories," Page 94,      for groups that can make referrals). And be sure to ask      about fees when you make your initial appointment.    </p>    <p>      <em>San Francisco-based health writer Michael Castleman is      the author of Blended Medicine, a guide to combining      conventional and complementary therapies for best      results.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Share your holistic health stories, advice and      questions in the Holistic Health forum, on Mother's Web      site at www.MotherEarthNews.com .</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Natural Doctor Directories</strong>    </p>    <p>      Check with the following organizations to find accredited      health care practitioners in your area.    </p>    <p>      <strong>American Massage Therapy Association</strong> (847)      864-0123 www.amtamassage.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>Biofeedback Certification Institute of America      (BCIA)</strong> (303) 420-2902 www.bcia.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>American Association of Naturopathic      Physicians</strong> (866) 538-2267 www.naturopathic.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>National Certification Commission for Acupuncture      and Oriental Medicine</strong> (703) 548-9004      www.nccaom.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>American Herbalists Guild</strong> (770) 751-6021      www.americanherbalistsguild.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>American Academy of Medical Acupuncture</strong>      (323) 937-5514 www.medicalacupuncture.org    </p>    <p>      <strong>Council for Homeopathic Certification</strong>      (866) 242-3399 www.homeopathicdirectory.com    </p>    <p>      <strong>Homeopathic Academy</strong> of Naturopathic      Physicians (208) 336-3390 www.hanp.net    </p>    <p>      <strong>Complementary Credentials: What the Letters      Mean</strong>    </p>    <p>      Compared with conventional medicine, complementary      therapies are less regulated. Because of the bureaucracy      involved in prescribing drugs, it’s virtually      impossible to hang a shingle saying “M.D.” if      you’re not one. But it’s easier to pass      yourself off as an acupuncturist or herbalist without      extensive training. That’s why it’s important      to understand complementary medical credentials.      Don’t be intimidated, they’re not difficult to      understand - and it’s important to consult      practitioners who have solid bona fides.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Massage Therapists</strong><br />      Different states have different licensing programs for      massage therapists. Letters after the name include: C.M.T.      for certified massage therapist, or R.M.T. for registered      massage therapist. Contact your state department of      consumer or medical affairs for the designation in your      state.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Biofeedback Trainers</strong><br />      Many health professionals practice biofeedback, among them:      doctors, M.D., D.O., Ph.D.; registered nurses, R.N.; and      physical therapists, P.T. In addition, biofeedback      professionals should be certified by the Biofeedback      Certification Institute of America (BCIA) and have the      following letters after their name: BCIA-C, meaning      certified by BCIA. Some practitioners have only BCIA      certification and no other degree, but they still are      qualified to practice biofeedback therapy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Naturopaths</strong><br />      Graduates of naturopathic medical schools earn an N.D.      degree - naturopathic doctor. Naturopaths are      licensed to practice in 11 states (Alaska, Arizona,      Connecticut, Hawaii, Maine, Montana, New Hampshire, Oregon,      Utah, Vermont and Washington), and five Canadian provinces      (Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, Ontario and      Saskatchewan). Elsewhere, they practice under other medical      credentials, typically: M.D., D.O., acupuncturist,      chiropractor or clinical nutritionist.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Herbalists</strong><br />      Most herbalists practice as acupuncturists, Chinese      medicine physicians, naturopaths, nurses or doctors. The      American Herbalists Guild (AHG) awards the title      Professional Herbalist to those who pass its exam. They      become Professional Members of the American Herbalists      Guild and can use the letters AHG after their names. Some      U.S. herbalists train in the United Kingdom at the National      Institute of Medical Herbalists. Members of the Institute      may use the letters MNIMH after their names.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Homeopaths</strong><br />      Most U.S. homeopaths practice under one or more of the      credentials listed above and also practice homeopathy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Acupuncturists/Chinese Medicine      Practitioners</strong><br />      Different states have different designations for      acupuncturists and Chinese medicine physicians. Credentials      include: Licensed Acupuncturist, L.Ac.; Registered      Acupuncturist, R.Ac.; Acupuncturist Ac.; Certified      Acupuncturist, C.A.; Acupuncture Assistant under an M.D.,      Ac.A.; Doctor of Oriental Medicine, D.O.M.; Oriental      Medicine Doctor, O.M.D.; Doctor of Acupuncture, D.Ac.; and      Acupuncture Practitioner, Ac.P.
