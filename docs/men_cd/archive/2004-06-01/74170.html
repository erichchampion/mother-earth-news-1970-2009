                    <h5 id="byline">      by Carol Mack    </h5>        <p>      <em>Is something bugging your garden? In this special<br />      Gardeners Almanac offering, our contributors offer      pest<br />      management advice, including even employing runner ducks      and<br />      wielding pingpong paddles.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>- MOTHER</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>New England/Maritime Canada</strong>    </p>    <p>      The greenhouse is looking empty, the garden, full. Time for      a second planting of lettuce, mesclun and cilantro. By late      June or mid-July, most garden plants will be well      established and looking very lush unless you are plagued      with any one of the "terrible three" - flea beetles,      striped cucumber beetles or squash bugs. Tiny flea beetles      chew pinhead-sized holes in the leaves of greens and      brassicas, turning them to lace. Their larvae attack plant      roots, too. I opt for a fabric row cover over my salad      greens as a physical barrier to protect them, but I use      cottonseedbased dormant oil on brassicas. Used as directed,      this "eco" oil works extremely well to deter flea beetles.      Time usually takes care of striped cucumber beetles. Row      covers or hand picking can protect young plants until they      gain enough size to withstand the damage. Squash bugs are      more of a challenge. To get a jump on our short growing      season, I always set out squash and melon seedlings, rather      than planting seeds. On the day of transplant, these tender      beauties are protected with a roomy bonnet of row cover.      After they send out runners, outgrowing the row cover, they      must be diligently monitored. Squish the bronzegold egg      clusters on the undersides of leaves or smother them with      dormant oil. Later, continue to check under the leaves for      young and mature beetles. As a last resort, the plant-de      rived insecticide rotenone kills them, but it is very      strong and should be used only as directed, and with great      caution. Rotenone is no longer approved for certified      organic products.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Roberta Bailey [FEDCO Seeds, Waterville,<br /> Maine:      (207) 873-7333; www.fedcoseeds.com ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong>    </p>    <p>      Take a moment in mid-June to sow brassicas for a fall crop.      Plant thickly under a protective fabric row cover, and then      on a wet day in August, move the seedlings out into other      beds. When corn reaches 18 inches in height, try planting      some heattolerant lettuce between the rows. Keep watch for      Colorado potato beetles and foil them with hay or straw      mulch, or pick them off the plants. Chickens and runner      ducks are better at this than humans, and enjoy it more.      Lure cucumber beetles away from crops with golden amaranth      (the beetles" favorite); when the amaranth is well      infested, release your fowl to spring the "jaws" of this      trap. Where Mexican bean beetles are a problem, try `Black      Valentine" and `Royalty Purple Pod" beans. These can be      grown, harvested and tilled in just before the beetles      complete a life cycle, and both have proven resistant to      bean mosaic virus. For flavor, yield, and disease and      insect resistance, the old-fashioned yellow crookneck      squash cannot be beat. Try `Thompson" broccoli for a fall      harvest of exquisite disease-and harlequin-bug-resistant      heads. The bottom line, though, is that the best key to      pest prevention I've encountered is healthy soil. Watering      plants with compost tea will strongly combat many diseases      and fungi, and, when in doubt, side dress with compost,      too.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Cricket Rakita [Southern Exposure Seed Exchange,      Mineral,<br /> Va.: (540) 8949480; www.southernexposure.com      ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Interior</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cabbage worms and cabbage loopers can be problems with -      what else? cabbage. They also can attack collards, the      vitamin and mineral-packed favorite Southern side dish.      Both insects are identified easily as small green larvae      eating big holes in your plants. They can be stopped in      their tracks by products containing Bt (Bacillus      thuringiensis), a naturally occurring bacterium that will      not harm humans, wildlife or domestic animals.    </p>    <p>      Japanese beetles are eating machines, and just a few can      destroy a plant in no time. They aren't picky about what      they eat, either. Commercially available traps will help,      but make sure you put them far away from the infestation      site, or you may make a bad problem worse by attracting      more beetles to plants already under siege. Aphids can      attack a variety of plants in your garden, including      cucumbers, melons and tomatoes. The tiny green insects      cause the leaves to curl and wilt, and they spread plant      disease as well. Yellow sticky traps are the chemical-free      way to control aphids - they are attracted to the color and      then become stuck in the adhesive "goo." Insecticidal soaps      also will kill aphids, although several applications may be      needed, and you may have to add a surfactant (spreader) to      make the liquid stick.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Lori Hardee and Karen Park Jennings [Park Seed      Company, Greenwood,<br /> S.C.: (800) 845-3369; www.parkseed.com      ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>Gulf Coast</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now's the time to plant warm-season crops like okra,      Southern peas, Malabar spinach and sunchokes (Jerusalem      artichokes). Even a late crop of bush beans isn't out of      the question. Keep up the watering, and mulch everything!      Leaffooted bugs and their relatives, including the green      stink bug, are hard to ignore during this season. They love      developing tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, beans and,      especially, Southern peas. Hand picking may help,      pesticides will work even better, but these bugs keep      coming back. If you're not too fond of black-eyed peas, you      might plant some off to the edge of the garden and use them      as a trap crop.    </p>    <p>      Squash vine borers start to lay eggs about the time the      first squash flowers begin to appear. You can watch for the      orange-and-black moths about this time, too - they tend to      come in around dusk; then, swat them with a pingpong      paddle. Or, spray the stems with recommended pesticides.      The best way to deal with pecan scab fungus is by planting      or re-grafting to resistant varieties such as "Caddo,"      "Elliot" or "Forkert." Plum curculio still will be working      in the nectarines, peaches and plums; remove any small      fruit with a drop of sap protruding as these already have      an egg laid in them.    </p>    <p>      <em>- William D. Adams<br />      [Burton,Texas]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Central/Midwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a wonderful time of year, with plants growing      visibly larger every day. Encourage your children to help      out with gardening by planting seeds in shapes instead of      straight rows - our "happy face" onion patch delighted my      daughter last year. Little hands do a fine job weeding, and      curious young eyes help patrol for bugs. One insect we      watch for is the cucumber beetle, which can strip the      leaves off cucurbit seedlings. Some years, we have had to      plant our squash and immediately dust them with a mix of      diatomaceous earth and rotenone. The cucumber beetle not      only eats the plants but also spreads viral diseases, so      it's important to control them. They can overwinter in corn      stubble, so be sure to do a fall cleanup. If you want to      avoid using pesticides in the garden, learn about insect      life cycles and eating habits; then, plan your garden      accordingly. For example, by seeding carrots after June 15,      we generally can avoid carrot rust fly.    </p>    <p>      Changing weather can bring problems with plant diseases.      Hot temperatures followed by cool nights and damp weather      spread mildews and early blight. Often, it is too late to      salvage plants after disease sets in, so take preventative      action beforehand: Leave space between plants for air to      circulate and adjust watering practices. If you regularly      notice problems with fungal and viral diseases, look for      disease-tolerant or resistant varieties. It also is      important to rotate your crops each year so that the      soil-borne problems do not overtake your garden.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Connie Dam-Byl [William Dam Seeds Ltd., Dundas,<br />      Ontario: (905) 628-6641; www.damseeds.com ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>North Central/Rockies</strong>    </p>    <p>      "The problem is the solution," says Bill Mollison,      co-founder of the Permaculture Movement. The fact that we      perceive a pest or disease as a problem ultimately means we      do not understand enough about our garden and its      ecosystem. Pests give us the opportunity to look further      and understand more. Most pests disappear before much      damage is done, thanks to a host of beneficial helpers. We      help out with daily walks to spot and remove problems while      they are small. Our most effective disease control is      avoidance of top watering. In the drier climates of the      mountainous West, blights, mosaic, molds and scab almost      completely disappear when overhead sprinkling is replaced      with drip or ditch irrigation. We even cured blossomend rot      in our summer squash using this method. If cabbage root      maggots become a problem in extremely wet weather,      carefully mix a spoonful of diatomaceous earth or wood      ashes into the soil, or protect the soil from rain. Plant      radishes as a trap crop, or place tar paper around the base      of plants to deter the flies that lay the rootmaggot eggs.    </p>    <p>      Cutworms can be discouraged with paper collars at the base      of each pepper plant. Prevent pea-root rot by planting in      well-drained soils and rotating crops frequently. Avoid      planting peas in cold, wet soil in the spring to avoid seed      rot. Many tomato diseases are associated with hot, moist      weather and are not a threat in higher, drier climes      (except in greenhouses). To prevent most problems, use      healthy transplants, fertile soil and plenty of calcium.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Bill McDorman [Seeds Trust, High Altitude Gardens,      Hailey,<br /> Idaho: (208) 788-4363; www.seedstrust.com ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Northwest, Part I</strong>    </p>    <p>      Growing a healthy garden with sustainable practices is the      ideal long-term insect control and usually is the most      effective intervention. To attract good bugs to help      prevent pest outbreaks, grow herbs and flowers to provide      sanctuary, pollen and nectar.    </p>    <p>      Fresh, tender peas are easiest to grow in the Northwest      when using varieties resistant to pea virus and powdery      mildew. Three good examples are `Oregon Trail" shelling      pea, `Oregon Sugar Pod 11" and `Sugar Sprint" snap peas.      Sow through mid-June and again in mid to late July for an      extended fall harvest. Brassicas, members of the cabbage      family, all are susceptible to cabbage root maggot. Young      plants are vulnerable to damage, but with a covering of a      lightweight fabric row cover, you'll be harvesting perfect      radishes, pak choi and other susceptible favorites. As      plants mature, it's safe to remove the row cover except in      areas that have had previous heavy infestations.    </p>    <p>      Reports keep coming in from Northwest gardeners      successfully experimenting with direct-sowing tomatoes in      early June. Try an extra-early variety like `Legend," don't      sow too deep and cover the planting space with a hot cap,      clear plastic jug or row cover. The advantages include      gardening ease, no transplant shock and, with `Legend," you      get valuable late-blight resistance.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Rose Marie Nichob McGee [Nichols Garden Nursery,      Albany,<br /> Ore.: (800) 4223985; www.nicholsgarnnursery.com      ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>Pacific Northwest, Part II</strong>    </p>    <p>      The focus of June and July is typically on summer crops -      but don't be deceived. This is the perfect time to start      fall and winter crops, too. As your spring-sown greens      grow, harvest the lower leaves on a regular basis to allow      for multiple pickings. Without a doubt, one pest that tops      the list for most Pacific Northwest gardeners is the      loathed slug. There is nothing worse than planting a      seedling only to have it devoured overnight by these slimy      little hooligans. The best defense I have found is slug      bait containing iron phosphate. Although it is not      certified organic, it is safe to use around pets and      children, and the active ingredient is found naturally in      soil.    </p>    <p>      If the carrot rust fly mangles your carrot crop, try      growing the resistant yet-sweet-and-tasty `Flyaway" carrot.      Diseases thrive in our moist climate. It is so frustrating      to nurture tomatoes all season long only to have them      destroyed by late blight after the first fall rain. If this      has happened to you, try growing `Legend." Bred at Oregon      State University, it is the world's first late-blight      resistant tomato. `Success PM" summer squash is resistant      to powdery mildew, and Alibi" cucumber resists cucumber      mosaic virus, powdery and downy mildew, and scab. Keep in      mind that one of the best ways to ward off trouble is to      start with a strong, healthy plant. Just like people, the      healthiest plants are the ones best able to combat      diseases.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Josh Kirschenbaum [Territorial Seed Company, Cottage      Grove, Ore.:<br /> (541) 9429547; www.territorialseed.com ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong>Southwest</strong>    </p>        <p>      With the arrival of the summer solstice, the Southwest sun      intensifies. Be careful not to over fertilize - too much      nitrogen can attract sucking insects like aphids. Over the      centuries, the "three sisters" of the Southwest - beans,      corn and squash - have nurtured several pests. Squash bugs      (locally called "chinchas") suck juices from leaves and      fruit. Populations build through the summer with the births      of new generations. Prevent early infestations with a row      cover over your young plants. When flowering begins,      uncover the plants to allow pollination, but treat them      with pepper spray and regularly brush off the clusters of      eggs. Squash vine-borer larvae shut down water uptake,      resulting in wilted plants. Again, prevent this with row      covers. The adult moth usually is gone by the time the      covers must be removed, but check the base of stems for      tiny white eggs throughout July. The Mexican bean beetle      likewise has an early spring cycle and is best avoided by      waiting until mid-June to sow beans. Eggs of a tiny      parasitic wasp (Pediobius foveolatus) are available for      release; encourage adult wasps to remain by interplanting      beans with flowering cilantro. Ear worm damage in sweet      corn can be prevented by applying Bt to the tip of each      ear. I've always preferred to exercise some tolerance and      simply cut off any damaged tips. In my experience, raccoons      are more critical to control in corn patches than worms.      Try planting a border of squash plants around your corn as      a prickly barrier to deter the "coons, or use an electric      fence.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Micaela Colley [Seeds of Change, Santa Fe,<br /> N.M.:      (888) 762-7333,<br />      www.seedsofchange.com ]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Coping with Grasshoppers</strong>    </p>        <p>      In late summer, grasshoppers, katydids and crickets are      staple foods not only of many bird species but of some      larger mammals as well. In the western United States, where      the Big Dry is the seasonal standard, these insects      constitute a major food item at that time of year. They're      also more prevalent in our gardens then, too.    </p>    <p>      Only a few of the more than 700 species of "shorthorned      grasshoppers" in the Acrididae family eat cultivated crops;      the others" appetites call for grasslands. Because the      garden-feeders are highly mobile, both by hopping and      flying, it is not enough to just control the ones inside      the gate; we also have to anticipate the flood of relatives      that will move in when the larger wild habitat is drying      out.    </p>    <p>      The product Nosema locustae, a biological insecticide, has      been used on "hoppers with some success. It only kills the      very young instars (stages of growth), so early spring      application is recommended. And it can take up to six weeks      to kill the insects.    </p>    <p>      Nosema is used mostly on large tracts of range land. No      research has been published reporting on how it works on      areas of less than 10 acres-which would include most      gardens. For small parts of a garden, exclusion with a      fabric row cover is a realistic remedy. Bringing in      domestic birds to feed on the "hoppers seems to be the      healthiest all-around solution for gardens. Short-term      herding of a small flock of chickens, turkeys, ducks or      guineas inside the garden can put a big dent in the      resident grasshopper crowd. Close attention to the birds"      foraging is required, however, because some will find      garden produce as tasty as the "hoppers.    </p>    <p>      If you can let your birds range outside the garden, too,      then you're more likely to be blessed with an absence of      grasshoppers inside the garden gate. Putting up a temporary      fence about 6 feet outside the permanent garden fence      during the mid to late summer months and letting the      poultry forage in this "moat" for even a few hours a day      will help keep the grasshopper populations down inside the      garden, too.    </p>    <p>      - John Stuart    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>Sources of the Noserna insecticide include Mellinger's      ( www.mellingers.com )<br /> and Planet Natural (      www.planetnatural.com ).<br /> For more on using poultry in your      garden, go to our Web site, www.MotherEarthNews.com;<br /> read      "Poultry Pest Patrol" and check out "Go Ahead!
