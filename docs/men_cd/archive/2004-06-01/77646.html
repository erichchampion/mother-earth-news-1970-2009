                    <p>      <em>The daintiest of the oregano tribe, marjoram has a      minty, sweet flavor with rich savory undertones that sets      it apart from its more strongly flavored oregano      cousins.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      Native to North Africa and western Asia, marjoram (Origanum      majorana) is sometimes called "knotted" marjoram because      the tiny white flowers emerge from knot-shaped buds. You      can use this flower characteristic to help confirm that you      do, indeed, have marjoram rather than a related oregano, of      which there are more than 30 species. This herb sometimes      is called sweet marjoram, too, because no other oregano      matches its clean, sprightly flavor.    </p>    <p>      To the ancient Greeks, marjoram was the herb of marital      bliss. Thought to be a favorite of Aphrodite, the goddess      of love, it was woven into garlands that brides and grooms      wore on their heads. Also according to ancient folklore,      sleeping with a bit of marjoram tucked under your pillow      was supposed to promote dreams of true love. And before the      Middle Ages, many people believed that planting marjoram on      graves helped assure the happiness of departed loved ones.    </p>    <p>      Marjoram is not considered an important medicinal herb, but      a tea brewed from its leaves may help with indigestion,      headache or stress.    </p>    <p>      The herb's flavor more than justifies growing it in your      garden for culinary purposes, though. Think of marjoram as      a tame oregano and use it with confidence in Italian-style,      tomato-based dishes such as pasta or pizza, or as an accent      for most vegetables, especially potatoes, whether they're      served hot, or marinated and served cold. Marjoram also is      good on fresh tomato sandwiches, and it pairs well with      eggs or cheese. A light sprinkling adds savory flavor to      cream-based sauces or soups, especially potato soup, and to      savory herb butter, too. And, the flowering tops are a      pretty addition to herbal vinegar.    </p>    <p>      Dried marjoram delivers flavor nearly equal to that of the      fresh version; on the plant, the flavor usually peaks just      before the flower buds form, though the buds are edible,      too. When drying marjoram for kitchen use, lay 3-inch-long      stem tips on a dry cookie sheet and place the cookie sheet      in a 150-degree oven for two to three hours; this method      retains marjoram's essential oils and the green color of      its leaves. Store the dried stems with their leaves intact      in an airtight container in a cool, dark place; when you      need some leaves for a recipe, just strip the right amount      from the stems.    </p>    <p>      A fast-growing plant, marjoram will produce a steady supply      of new growth if it is regularly trimmed back. Should you      have more stems than you can use in the kitchen, mix them      into potpourris, sachets, tussie-mussies or herbal wreaths;      the flowering tops sometimes are used as a source of beige      or gray dye, too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Growing Your Own</strong>    </p>    <p>      Marjoram cannot tolerate subfreezing temperatures, so it      usually is grown as an annual, but it can be carried over      because it is one of the easiest herbs to propagate from      stem cuttings (described below), and it grows beautifully      indoors in winter near a sunny, south-facing window.    </p>    <p>      In the garden, marjoram never grows more than 15 inches      tall, and the soft stems tend to sprawl as they mature, so      this herb makes a good edging plant. You can start with      seed sown indoors in late winter, but germination usually      is only about 50 percent, and early growth is very slow; a      faster option is to buy new plants in spring.    </p>    <p>      Most marjoram plants are grown from cuttings, so they are      well rooted and ready to grow as soon as you transplant      them into warm soil. After the last spring frost, set out      plants in full sun, in soil that is gritty and fast      draining with a near-neutral pH. Alternatively, you can      grow marjoram in containers; it's a good plant to mix with      other culinary herbs such as basil and thyme.    </p>    <p>      Feed your marjoram plants monthly with an all-purpose      organic plant food, or more often if you're growing them in      containers. Take care not to overwater marjoram, but watch      closely for signs of drought stress, too. Plants that wilt      for more than a few hours in midday need more water. Cut      stems back often to encourage your plant to branch, or wait      until just before the flower buds form to harvest them in      bulk by shearing the whole plant back by two-thirds its      size. Sufficient stems for a second cutting should develop      by early fall.    </p>    <p>      Take cuttings to root in midsummer: Cut several 3-inch-long      stem tips that show no flower buds, remove all but the six      to eight topmost leaves and set the cuttings to root in      moist seed-starting mix. Placed in a shady spot and kept      constantly moist, they should develop vigorous, new root      systems in about three weeks. At that time, transplant the      rooted cuttings, two each to a 6-inch pot filled with      potting soil. A few weeks later, pinch back the tops to      encourage branching.    </p>    <p>      With casual care, these new plants will continue to grow      through fall and winter, and into the following spring.      Soon after moving the plants outdoors, take cuttings from      your overwintered marjoram, allow the cuttings to develop      roots and then transplant them to the garden in early      summer. This way, you can keep a strain of marjoram      indefinitely, and always have plenty of fresh sprigs for      use in the kitchen.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> contributing editor Barbara Pleasant      lives in North Carolina.

Cook the pasta according to      package directions. Three minutes before the cooking time      is up, add the broccoli to the pot. After two more minutes,      when the pasta is just done and the broccoli is tender but      still firm, turn off the heat, drain the cooking water and      return the pasta, broccoli and garlic to the pot. Add the      cream cheese, wine, salt, pepper and marjoram, and as the      cream cheese melts, toss all the ingredients to mix well.      Place the pasta mixture on a warmed serving dish and top      with Parmesan cheese and chopped fresh tomatoes. Serves 3.    </p>
