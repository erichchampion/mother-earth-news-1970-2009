                    <p>      <strong>Why Whole Foods are Better</strong></p>        <p>      There's just no substitute for meeting your nutritional      needs the old-fashioned way. "It doesn't matter how you      try," says Cornell University food scientist Rui Hai Liu,      "vitamin supplements cannot match the combinations of      compounds in whole foods." Taken together within a whole      (minimally processed) food, these substances are      synergistic, producing a stronger effect than any of the      individual nutrients does on its own.    </p>    <p>      Liu and his colleagues came to their conclusions after      years of studying more than 8,000 antioxidants and other      chemicals found in fruits, vegetables and whole grains.      They found that because these compounds differ in their      molecular size, polarity and solubility, they produce a      powerful natural combination that is more biologically      available to human cells, organs and tissues than any      single nutrient or pill.    </p>    <p>      One medium apple, for example, with only 6 milligrams (mg)      of vitamin C, has enough other antioxidants -      quercetin, procyanidins, carcchin and epicatcchin -      to produce as much antioxidant activity as 1,500 mg of      vitamin C supplements.    </p>    <p>      In the case of whole grains, part of the advantage comes      from the digestive process itself. Compounds in whole      grains are bound in the cell walls and until recently were      believed to be an indigestible part of the fiber. In fact,      90 percent of the compounds are bound, passing through the      stomach and small intestines undigested.    </p>    <p>      But Liu found that the bound compounds are released further      down by the microflora in the colon. These compounds in      whole wheat have potent antioxidant and anticancer      properties that can profoundly affect colon health. Refined      grain products even "fortified" with added vitamins cannot      compare.    </p>    <p>      "We still don't know all the compounds that are important      or how they work together," Liu says. "I have never taken      dietary supplements. I eat all kinds of fruit, including a      daily apple, vegetables and whole grains. There is no other      way to get that much nutrition."<br />      - <em>Linda J. Quinn</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>[Source: Eating Well magazine ( <a href="http://www.eatingwell.com" target="_blank">www.eatingwell.com</a> )      and American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, both September      2003.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Frankenfood Setbacks Chronicled Around the      World</strong>    </p>    <p>      Two manufacturers of genetically modified (GM) crops took      major hits to their international expansion plans this      spring, and a U.S.-based organic group is urging a      tightening of regulations of GM crops in this country.    </p>    <p>      In Great Britain, one of the manufacturing firms, Bayer      CropScience, discontinued its efforts to commercialize GM      corn, citing constraints set by the UK government, which      had just allowed the crop after a three-year review.    </p>    <p>      In Australia, the Victoria state government has implemented      a four-year moratorium on GM crops, halting for the time      being efforts by another manufacturer, Monsanto Australia,      to introduce GM canola there. Other Australian states have      taken similar actions.    </p>    <p>      In the United States, the Organic Trade Association is      calling for more regulation of the GM industry. Also, the      Pew Initiative, in a special report released in April, has      laid out a number of options that ought to be considered in      any updating of the current GM regulations.
