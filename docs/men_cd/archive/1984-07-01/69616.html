                <p>      <em>If you look forward to riding - but      dread hauling - your bicycle, you'll like      this' easy-to-build rack.</em>    </p>           <p>      To the avid bicyclist, pedaling-to just about      anywhere-is a way of life. But even those among us      who may be on the verge of sprouting a crank set and wheels      have an occasional yearning to strap the ol' velo to the      family bus and take off in search of some new cycling      territory.    </p>		     <p>      Unfortunately, cartop bike carriers-especially the      high-tech, multifunction models-are all but      <em>obscenely</em> priced . . . while the less expensive      bumper- or trunk-mounted versions tend, by design, to      expose their cargo to more than a fair share of road and      street-parking hazards which, at worst, could turn straight      frames and trued wheels into a cruel form of modern      sculpture.    </p>    <p>      Strangely enough, considering their cost, the super-duper      roof racks aren't all that complicated. In fact, they so      closely resemble conventional drip-rail-mounted utility      bars (appropriately equipped with V-trough channel and      hinged support struts) that research staffer Dennis      Burkholder decided to attempt his own low-budget rendition      of the high-buck hauler, using readily available materials.    </p>    <p>      And as you can see in the accompanying photo, his efforts      were successful both in form and in function. The carrier's      main framing members are just two 4' lengths of 1" square      aluminum tubing furnished with suction-cup feet and sturdy      eyebolts. These bars are secured to the roof's drip rails      with straps and gutter hooks (we were able to locate a      readymade kit at a discount auto supply store).    </p>    <p>      To cradle and support bike tires of whatever dimension,      Dennis sliced a 6' piece of 3" Schedule 40 PVC pipe      lengthwise and fastened each half-concave surface      up-to the top of the square framing bars, using      metal-cutting screws. To allow room for two bikes to stand      side by side (and to make the frame of a size to fit snug      on nearly any auto top), he spaced the pipe sections 30"      apart and centered the aluminum bars 37" from each other. A      46" -long 1/2" conduit-run on the diagonal and      screwed to the frame-keeps the assembly square.    </p>        <p>      The folding support struts consist of 1/2" X 48" lengths of      conduit, each bent into an elongated U and attached to what      will be the rear framing bar with 1" sections of 1/8"      aluminum angle. The down-tube clamps are made from 4-1/2"      sections of 1" square aluminum tubing cut to match the      contour of the struts to which they're attached      <em>and</em> the down tube of a bike frame. A spring-loaded      carriage bolt run through each pair of clamps assures a      positive grip, and-to prevent scratches and      abrasion-Dennis covered the jaws with a plastic-dip      coating. (Duct or electrical tape would be a cheapo      alternative.)    </p>    <p>      Once the rack is hooked to the car roof-support      struts to the rear-securing the bicycles is a cinch:      The wheels are laid in the plastic troughs (fronts facing      rearward), and then the struts can be swung up so the      padded clamps can hold each bike's down tube. With that      done, each wheel is strapped in place. Unless you have an      exceptionally heavy machine, installing and removing a bike      should be no problem ... and even sudden stops will tend to      draw the bikes down against the cradles rather than lever      them upward. Best of all, your "ride" will be safe from any      street-level mishaps ... and you can enjoy your jaunt      without spending a fortune.    </p>
