                    <h5 id="byline">      By Kathy Bennett    </h5>    <p>      It's 8:00 and already getting dark ... too soon for the day      to end. Maureen has just finished milking; the children are      shouting as they play in the grounded canoes; the sound of      piano music wafts on the wind. James and Damien walk by on      their way to the shower house. Louise is going up to the      industrial building to weave hammocks. I'm just sitting,      watching the sun set behind the trees, purpling the clouds      and the mist that lies on the valley.    </p>        <p>      My community is called East Wind. What is it? It's land,      buildings, people, values, and the ideal of "community"      that all of us here are sometimes filled with. It's not      utopia or paradise, but it's a way of life that we have      some control over, that we can create and <em>keep</em>      creating to fill our needs, desires, and dreams. It's a      living, changing organism that grows-sometimes      intentionally, sometimes in confusion. It stubs its toe and      cries, celebrates, gets distracted, and occasionally has to      redecide where it's going. Community, you see, is not a      finished product but a <em>process.</em>    </p>    <p>      East Wind is located on 160 acres in the Missouri Ozarks      near the Arkansas border. We lease an additional 200 acres      to grow hay and grain for our beef and dairy herds. We are      self-sufficient in dairy products, supply many of the eggs      we need, and have a one-and-a-halfacre garden.    </p>    <p>      We also market hammocks (from our own rope products      industry), "Pendulum" chairs, and "Utopian" sandals. In      1981 another enterprise was started: providing nut      butters-peanut , almond, and cashew-and sesame tahini      to food co-op warehouses across the country.    </p>        <p>      There are now about 50 of us, including four children, and      three babies are on the way. Our long-term plan is to grow      to 750 ... but slowly enough to be economically and      ecologically sound. We're striving to be a planned and      fully integrated community that deals with the complexities      of life in as sane, logical, caring, and equitable a      fashion as possible. To help realize that goal, we have a      labor system which insures that work gets done when, where,      and how we desire. We provide health care for our members,      from delivering babies to caring for our sick. We have a      program of Montessori education and 24-hour child care. We      provide lunch and dinner for everyone every day (as well as      a short-order breakfast two days a week), and we routinely      take part in such activities as trash collection and      vehicle maintenance.    </p>    <p>      We've chosen to base our society on <em>cooperation      ...</em> as an alternative to the material wastefulness,      competitiveness, and isolation of the "outside" world.      Thus, we hold our land, labor, and businesses in common.      All income generated by our activities belongs to the      community, and we decide as a group what projects we'll      undertake, what goods we'll purchase, and how we'll divide      them. Since we share the use of our vehicles and laundry      and kitchen facilities, we need fewer of them to provide      "enough." And we guarantee that our members have adequate      food, clothing, and shelter without having to compete with      one another for these things.    </p>    <p>      East Wind tries to fulfill its members' social needs      through discussion groups, assertiveness training      workshops, a newly formed "Emotional Health Team," and      various recreational activities, among other things. We try      to provide the greatest good for the greatest number      without losing sight of the minority's interests. We aim      for feelings of support, trust, and interdependence ...      feelings, in short, of <em>community.</em>    </p>        <p>      Our group is also committed to equality in as many ways as      we can find. We give all our members the same access to      jobs, training opportunities, and positions of      responsibility. (Yes, Virginia, you too could be a compost      manager or learn to run one of our half-million-dollar      businesses!) Our weekly discretionary funds and vacation      money-albeit somewhat limited-are allotted      equally, and all labor is valued the same, whether in      industry, child care, agriculture, or housekeeping.      Everyone shares equally in the work and in its benefits.    </p>    <p>      Physical violence is one of the few offenses for which      one's membership can be terminated. We don't choose to      relate to one another in that manner. Instead, we support      facilitated conflict resolution, use of intermediaries, or      even writing angry papers back and forth. (Yes, we do still      have our little flare-ups now and then.) This nonviolence      among ourselves and the fact that we're miles from paved      roads and outsiders create a tremendous sense of physical      security. It does my paranoid citybred heart good to be      completely unconcerned about footsteps coming up behind me      at 3:00 AM. I know they come from someone who will do me no      harm and may even want to share a cup of tea before bed.    </p>    <p>      East Wind has no powerful or charismatic leaders but      instead elects a three-person board of planners. These      people serve an 18-month term and are responsible for      facilitating meetings, nominating their own successors, and      helping to guide the community through proposals and      discussions. Decisions are made by majority vote, with      provisional members having a partial vote.    </p>    <p>      Every now and then-when we seem to be losing our      direction and getting bogged down in petty      differences-I sometimes wish we <em>did</em> have an      all-knowing, firmly gentle guru to take over this task of      building a new society. But East Wind is a community of      <em>mind,</em> not of spirit. We came together out of      dissatisfaction with the existing society. We're not here      by inspirational guidance but by deliberate decision. We      aren't waiting for the voice of God but are listening to      one another and to voices within, planning and testing      other ways of doing things and being together.    </p>    <p>      But wait! Does that sound too secular for you, too      difficult? We do, in fact, have revelations ... and      "miracles," too: seeing someone explain something calmly      and logically to an angry child who then <em>acts</em>      calmly and logically ... finding myself, who had never done      anything mechanical, changing a water pump ... knowing how      good, how much like "family" it feels as we 50 diverse      individuals gather together for a Thanksgiving feast.    </p>    <p>      It's possible! It's working! Maybe community <em>is</em>      more than a dream. Come and see for yourself... but please      write first (East Wind Community, Inc., Box MEA3, Tecumseh,      MO 65760) because space is limited.    </p>
