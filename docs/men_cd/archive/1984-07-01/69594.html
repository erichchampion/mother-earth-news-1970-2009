                <p>      Planning a hike, stroll, sprint, or jaunt into the woods      this summer? Better remember to ...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Ed Dowie    </h5>    <p>      Ticks! You know the eight-legged, tough-shelled little      bloodsuckers I'm talking about. With teeth so sharp you      don't feel their bite, they secretly attach themselves to      you and your animals and hang on as if they'll never let      go. When you discover one and pull it off, you wind up      extracting as much skin as tick, and you're stuck with a      varmint that's all but impossible to destroy.    </p>    <p>      Ah, but did you know that, besides giving you nasty nicks      to remember them by, some species can also leave you with      an unpleasant or even fatal infectious disease? The most      prevalent strains of tick-spread disease are Colorado tick      fever, relapsing fever, and Rocky Mountain spotted fever      (RMSF). Of the three, RMSF is not only the most dangerous      but also the most widespread. Since the initial symptoms of      all three are fairly similar, if you have been bitten by a      tick and show any signs of tick fever you should seek a      doctor's help immediately, on the chance that you might      have RMSF. Still, to keep things straight, here's a brief      description of each strain, including its characteristics      and range.    </p>        <p>      <em>Colorado tick fever</em> is the most common strain of      tick-related illness in the western half of the United      States. Cases have been reported in California, Colorado,      Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Washington, and Wyoming. Symptoms      usually occur three to seven days after a tick bite and      consist of high fever (up to 105°F), followed by      headache, weakness, loss of appetite, nausea, vomiting, and      oversensitivity to light. After about five days, the fever      and other symptoms will start to subside, only to return in      about a week. However, permanent recovery from this strain      of tick fever almost always occurs without complications.      And once a person's had it, he or she tends to build up a      resistance to further attacks.    </p>    <p>      <em>Relapsing fever</em> , like Colorado fever, occurs      mostly in the West. Its symptoms, which appear about a week      after a tick bite, include high fever (during which the      patient may become delirious), headaches, nausea, vomiting,      and joint and muscle pain. Some victims will develop a dark      red rash all over their bodies; others will become      jaundiced, indicating liver involvement. Symptoms usually      subside within about ten days but, as the name suggests,      recur for another bout after a week.    </p>    <p>      <em>Rocky Mountain spotted fever</em> occurs in virtually      all states. With an incubation period averaging seven days,      RMSF is characterized by high fever (104 to 107°F),      severe headaches, spinal and muscle stiffness, loss of      appetite, nausea, and vomiting. After about the fifth day,      tiny pink dots will appear around wrists and ankles, and      eventually this rash will spread all over the body. If the      fever remains high for seven to ten days and the symptoms      are left untreated, the nervous system will become      involved, and death can result. Even with treatment the      disease can take several weeks or months to run its course.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TREATMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      At this time there is no vaccine specifically designed to      fight tick fever, but several antibiotics have proven      effective in treating it. So at the first signs of the      illness, the infected person should be taken to a doctor.      If you <em>can't</em> get an afflicted individual to a      physician right away-say, if you're on a wilderness      backpacking expedition-here are some things you can      do to help in the meantime.    </p>    <p>      [1] Keep the patient down and quiet. Rest is vital, because      any movement can produce further complications (such as a      ruptured spleen, which is a life-threatening emergency).    </p>    <p>      [2] Try to control the fever with aspirin or acetaminophen      (Tylenol or other brands). If these important medications      were somehow omitted from your first aid kit, then see to      it that the patient gets plenty of fluids and a cool bath      (a mountain stream may make a good tub if you're outdoors).      Should you find yourself in sagebrush country, boil some of      the herb's leaves to make an old-fashioned but effective      fever-fighting tea.    </p>    <p>      [3] Remember, though, that these measures are strictly      stopgap techniques. Your most important job is to      <em>evacuate the patient by ground or helicopter to the      nearest medical facility as soon as possible.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN OUNCE OF PREVENTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      All of this sounds downright scary, doesn't it? Still, tick      fever is amazingly easy to prevent. If you know your enemy      (the tick!) and how to guard against it, your chances of      contracting the fever are virtually nil.    </p>    <p>      The insects generally live in mountainous or heavily wooded      areas. During the spring and summer, they populate the      limbs and leaves of bushes, where they wait for a      warmblooded host to walk by. If none does, they eventually      drop to the ground for shade and moisture (where they can      remain all through the winter) and for further      opportunities to hitch a ride on an unsuspecting      benefactor.    </p>    <p>      When you plan to travel in tick country, dress for the      occasion. Wear garments that fit closely around the wrists      and ankles . . . tuck in shirttails ... and make sure pants      legs are enclosed in boots or high socks. Then-while      in the woods or after a day of hiking-make regular      checks of yourself and others in your party to make sure no      eight-legged freeloaders have climbed aboard.    </p>    <p>      Finding a tick on your person is no cause for alarm. If the      bug is still crawling around, simply brush it off. If it's      already bitten in for lunch, take immediate and careful      action to remove the intruder. The longer the tick remains      embedded, the greater your chances of infection.    </p>    <p>      There are a lot of different ways to pull ticks off. Some      claim that applying heat-say, a knife blade warmed by      a match-to the insect will make it back out of its      burrow. But in my experience heat usually causes the tick      to burn or explode, leaving the tick's head (a part likely      to cause infection) intact under the skin. Other people      suggest that applying a solvent-such as alcohol or      kerosene-will make the critter retreat. Most people      agree on the effectiveness of one very direct method: Grasp      the struggling scoundrel lengthwise with a pair of pointed      tweezers, making sure the sharp end of the tool is right      next to the skin, and-once you've got a good hold on      the bloodsucker-apply pressure and gently pull it      off. If the procedure is done correctly, you'll probably      remove a small piece of the patient's skin along with the      whole tick, but don't worry: Your main concern is to      extricate the entire bug. After you destroy the tick (burn      the rascal or toss the offender into a creek or whatever),      wash out the wound with soap and water, dry it off, and dab      antiseptic on it. And then don't neglect to thoroughly wash      your own hands as well, because it's possible to contract      tick fever through a cut or nick in your skin.    </p>    <p>      Tick fever <em>can</em> be a serious malady ... but, as you      can see, it can also be prevented by taking a few simple      precautions. So make this summer a more pleasant one by      remembering one hard-and-fast outdoor rule: Beware the      tick!    </p>
