                <p>      <em>Here's a way to catch henhouse marauders without      harming a hair on their furry little bods.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Barry Dordahl    </h5>        <p>      You say there's a weasel dining on your chickens? A      raccoon's growing fat on the eggs? Squirrels are gnawing      through your roof, rabbits are eating <em>all</em> the      lettuce from your garden, and a porcupine is sharpening its      teeth on your truck's tires? And because of all that your      thoughts are growing ever darker ... you have murder in      your heart ... but, when it comes right down to it, you      just can't bear to hurt the pesky rascals?    </p>    <p>      Well, you'd better get off dead center and do      <em>something.</em>    </p>    <p>      You might try running about your place at odd hours of the      night, wearing a flowing white nightie and banging on a pie      pan with a hammer. Or perhaps you should take up playing      the flute and Pied Piper the furry rustlers over yon far      hill.    </p>    <p>      Or you might want to livetrap the bothersome little dears      and release them miles away (say, for instance, near the      home of the president of your local utility company).    </p>    <p>      But you've seen live traps advertised, and you know they're      expensive. You can't afford one? All right. I'll show you      how to build your own for nothing (or maybe for $5,      depending on the health of your scrap pile). It'll take      only a few hours to whop together, and the first step is to      ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILD A BOX</strong>    </p>    <p>      The size of the box is up to you. Just make it big enough      to accommodate the largest animal you intend to catch. But,      as a practical matter, don't build a trap that's much      bigger than you need. I like a cage 12" high by 12" wide by      18" deep. With that size, I can capture anything from a      squirrel to a raccoon without fear of harming the prisoner.    </p>        <p>      To start, you'll need four corner posts, each 12" long (if      you're planning to build 'my" size). I use 2 X 2 pine, but      2 X 4's will work just as well. Any lumber or plywood at      least 1/2" thick will work for the top and bottom (roof and      floor) of the box. Cut the top piece 12" wide by 18" long,      and the bottom panel 12" wide by 20" long. With the four      corner posts and the top and bottom pieces cut, assemble      the basic box, letting the extra 2" of the 20" bottom board      extend on one end-that end is hereby designated as      the front-and nail the whole thing together.    </p>    <p>      Next, scavenge or buy some 1/4" wire mesh (often called      "hardware cloth"), preferably galvanized. Plain old screen      wire will do if you're after nothing larger or more      ferocious than squirrels. Staple or tack the wire to both      sides and one end (the back ... where the 2" extension      <em>isn't),</em> as shown in the accompanying illustration.    </p>    <p>      Now, with only the front remaining open, it's time to ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILD A TRAPDOOR</strong>    </p>    <p>      The door opens and closes the front of the box by sliding      up and down in a vertical track. My favorite material for      that track is tongue-and-groove oak flooring, but a      workable facsimile can be made by sawing grooves      longitudinally into the edges of any two pieces of 3/4" or      thicker board. Either way, you'll need two pieces of stock,      each about 2" wide and 24" long. Nail these to the front of      the box, their bottoms resting on the 2" extension of the      bottom, with the grooved sides facing inward. Be careful to      get them exactly the same distance apart at the top and      bottom, so the door won't hang up when dropping closed.    </p>    <p>      The best door material is galvanized sheet metal: 22-gauge      is ideal. Visit your local sheetmetal shop and beg a scrap      about 11" wide and 14" high. (Other salvageables will work,      too: a piece of your spouse's favorite cookie sheet, the      sheet-metal part of a real estate sign that's cluttering up      your neighborhood, etc.) When you get home with the makings      for the door-whatever material you come up with-cut      it to about 14" high and just wide enough to fit nicely      between the grooves of your track boards. It <em>must</em>      slide up and down freely. When the door fits and works to      your satisfaction, lift it out and drill a hole in it, say      1/4 " or so in diameter, about 1" up from the bottom and      centered from side to side, as shown in the drawing.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>BUILD THE SPRINGING MECHANISM</strong>    </p>    <p>      Appropriately enough, the driving force behind this      apparatus is a mousetrap (unless you're building large      enough to capture a bear, in which case maybe a      <em>rattrap</em> would be in order). Using either screws or      small nails, attach the trap-unset and with the bail      (that's the mouse-basher) facing toward the back-to      the top of the box, centered from side to side and located      3" to 4" from the back, as shown in the illustration.    </p>    <p>      When it's anchored securely, set the trap (watch your      fingers!) and measure the distance from the end of the bail      to the slide-down door. You'll need a piece of string or      thin wire 1" or so longer than that, so go fetch it. And      while you're at it, you might as well get a bigheaded nail,      too, not over 4" long. Tie one end of the string or wire to      the nail, just behind the head. Have the neighborhood brat      spring the mousetrap, and tie the other end of the string      or wire to the bail. Good. Now drill a 1/4"-diameter hole      through the mousetrap-boring it as close to the front      of the trap's bait pan as you can-and right on      through the top of the box, as shown.    </p>    <p>      Scrounge another string, this one measuring about 8" long      (fishing line works well), and tie a slipknot in one end      (or a hangman's noose, if you're so inclined) to hold the      bait. Run the other end of the 8" string up through the      hole you drilled near the mousetrap's bait pan, and tie      that end to the bait pan itself. Refer to the drawing to be      sure you've got this part right.    </p>    <p>      That's it! You're finished with all the building chores      (unless you want to add a couple of carrying handles, or      camouflage the box with chicken-color paint). Now it's time      to ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>TEST THE TRAP</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is the big moment! Make like you're a weasel, a bunny,      or whatever it is you hope to catch. Set the trap by      cocking the mousetrap and carefully inserting just the tip      of the nail into the hole in the bottom of the raised door.      Now hop or slink up to the trap, sniff the air, then dart      away and cower under a bush. Approach again. Stay a little      longer this time, then scurry back to cover. Repeat.      Finally, stay near the trap, sniffing all around, curious      and unsuspecting. Look into the open front of the box. See      the carrot. Quiver with anticipation. (If you're being a      weasel, envision a drumstick, but still quiver.) Your head      won't fit inside, you find, so reach your arm in and give a      light tug on the carrot or drumstick.    </p>    <p>      Whap. The mousetrap's bail smashes down where a mouse      isn't, violently jerking the string tied to the trigger      nail, which exits abruptly from its hole in the sliding      door ... which promptly drops guillotine-like on your arm.      It works, and what's more, now you know that the falling      door is harmless, should it catch the culprit amidships.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TRAPPING LORE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Bait and set your trap, then go away and leave it alone for      a while. (Be sure to use a bait that your intended captive      is known to fancy, since the trap will be competing for      attention with your poultry and garden.) Most catches will      probably be made at night, and it may take several days for      the human smell to wear off a new trap sufficiently to suit      a weasel. If you won't be able to relocate your quarry      immediately after making a catch, place the trap in the      shade. And never leave an animal in the trap any longer      than is absolutely necessary.    </p>    <p>      When you do transport your temporary charge to its new      home, drive several miles if it's a weasel, about a mile      for a rabbit ... and at least halfway around the world if      it's a neighborhood cat. You might try just releasing a      raccoon on the spot, since one such experience is usually      enough to keep most of these masked bandits away from your      digs (If the critter <em>does</em> return, though, it'll be      a lot wiser for the experience and much harder to      recapture.) If you find a female animal in your live trap,      consider whether she might have a litter waiting nearby,      helpless without her. (If this is of concern to you, dor in      the springtime.)    </p>    <p>      Use caution when releasing weasels and like-tempered      varmints. Yank the door open from behind and run as if the      devil's on your tail ... because he may be!    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOING COMMERCIAL</strong>    </p>    <p>      If all goes well with your trap building and live-catching      and relocating, you might want to expand into peddling your      customcrafted traps - and/or trapping services      - to beleaguered neighbors. (You can even drum up      extra business by strategically releasing the pests you      catch!)    </p>    <p>      But I must prepare you for one possible problem: The      unhappy day may come when you set a trap for a raccoon,      say, but catch a <em>skunk</em> instead. Since your naive,      city-type brother-in-law isn't around to trick into doing      the releasing chores, what do you do now?    </p>    <p>      Well, you consider your limitations, that's what. And then,      knowing you can't runn <em>that</em> fast, and knowing you      can't <em>wish</em> the thing away, you do some hard      thinking-and come up with the proverbial better skunk trap!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Someone already</em> has <em>come up      with "A Safe Skunk Trap, " and you can read about it-under      that exact title-in MOTHER NO. 64, page 152.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>NOTE: If you prefer not to cut this page, you may      order on a separate sheet of paper.</strong><br />      <strong>Please mention MOTHER when you do.</strong>    </p>
