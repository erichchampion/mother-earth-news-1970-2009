                <p>      <em>If you make this handy tool this afternoon, you can      enjoy a carefree cookout this evening.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ray Kielich    </h5>        <p>      One of the more pleasurable aspects of summer living is      sitting down with friends and family to a meal that's fresh      from the backyard grill. In my household, the delectable      aroma of barbecued chicken or grilled steaks and burgers is      as standard as the inevitable summer heat.    </p>    <p>      If you, too, are a fan of fine-cooked outdoor fare, you      might want to put together the homemade charcoal lighter      that's pictured here. This handy device, which can easily      be made from common household items, will produce a glowing      bed of briquettes in about ten minutes ... a definite      improvement over the time required to generate embers when      using the more conventional "lighter fluid" method.    </p>    <p>      The workhorse of the igniter is simply an 8" scrap of      6"-diameter single-walled stovepipe. You'll also need a 14      " length of 1/16" X 1" flat steel for the handle and      another 12" or so length of the same material for the three      legs (each prop measures approximately 3-1/2"). In the      charcoal chimney shown in the photo, the legs were brazed      to the inside of the stovepipe so that 2" of each leg      protruded from the bottom of the cylinder. (If you prefer,      you can attach the props with 1/8" POP rivets or No. 6      machine screws and nuts.) A section of 1/16" expanded metal      screening fits in the bottom of the cylinder and is      fastened by brazing (or with rivets or machine screws and      nuts) ... and a coat of heat-resistant flat black paint      gives the cooker its finishing touch.    </p>    <p>      When you've constructed the chimney, fill the igniter with      briquettes until it's about two thirds full, set it on your      outdoor grill, and place several sheets of crumpled      newspaper underneath the cylinder's metal screening. When      you light the paper, it will ignite the charcoal,      and-because of the "chimney effect"-the      briquettes will rapidly develop into glowing coals. When      the embers are ready, simply dump them on the grill and      prepare your feast. Be <em>sure</em> to use a barbecue      glove when you transfer the coals, as the handle of the      igniter is likely to be hot.    </p>    <p>      The charcoal igniter is not only nearly effortless to make      but is also easy on the environment, since paper is the      only fuel required. Another plus is that there's no lighter      fluid odor to affect the grilled fare. The homemade igniter      is less expensive to use than the fossil fuel fire, too,      because old newspapers or other burnables are readily      available and free for the asking (especially at picnics).    </p>    <p>      So if you've got a little time on your hands (and      yesterday's paper), try cobbling up your own version of my      charcoal igniter. You might just decide-as I      have-that the igniter is the greatest invention since      the discovery of fire!.    </p>
