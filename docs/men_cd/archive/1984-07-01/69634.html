                <p>      <em>Like us, wild animals suffer injury and illness ... and      need compassionate<br />      care.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Johanna Linch    </h5>        <p>      Wild animals are among earth's treasures, fellow creatures      in the great web of life. It's a part of our human      responsibility to care for them in spirit and in fact.    </p>        <p>      Every day, all over the United States, thousands of wild      animals of various species are struck by cars, shot,      trapped, poisoned, attacked by domestic pets, or otherwise      maimed and injured by the lethal substance and debris of      civilization. Additional wildlings are orphaned when their      parents are killed or captured, and others are abandoned      when their human owners are no longer willing or able to      take care of them.    </p>    <p>      Some of these animals survive; others die. Some who die do      so in agony and only after prolonged suffering.    </p>    <p>      Many of these animals could be saved if concerned people      knew what to do. Helping injured, sick, abandoned, or      orphaned wild animals consists of several main steps: [1]      removing them from a dangerous or unsuitable area and      taking them where they can receive medical attention,      shelter, food, and warmth; [2] raising them or restoring      their health; [3] training-or retraining-them      to be fully functional and independent in the wild; and [4]      releasing them in a suitable wilderness area to continue      their lives.    </p>        <p>      Although good-hearted people often try to medicate and      raise wild animals they've rescued-and some are      successful-steps 2 through 4 most often require the      attention of trained, experienced veterinarians and      wildlife rehabilitators if the animals' best interests are      to be met. Often, painful decisions must be made. What      should be done with an animal that's minus a limb, an eye,      or one of its normal functions? How long should one try to      help a seriously injured creature? The expertise of      experienced and compassionate professionals is needed for      such judgments ... but the whole process <em>begins</em>      with the first step: reporting the animal, or picking it up      and getting it to a place where it can receive further      help.    </p>        <p>      For information on these basic procedures, MOTHER contacted      several organizations and individuals who are dedicated to      the rescue, rehabilitation, and-whenever and wherever      possible-release of all species of wild animal. Among      these were Jeanne Milewski of the American Wildlife Rescue      Service, Rosemary and George Collett of Felicidades      Wildlife Foundation, Dr. Richard Brown of the Carolina      Raptor Center, J. Davies of the North Carolina Wildlife      Resources Commission, Jim Roche of the Western Carolina      Nature Center, and Susan Kelly of the Wildlife      Rehabilitation Council-all of whom were extremely      knowledgeable, caring, and cooperative.    </p>    <p>      A list of recommended titles on animal rescue and      rehabilitation appears at the end of this article. If      you're interested in the subject, we strongly urge you to      look into these books as soon as possible: They contain      information in far greater volume and detail than we can      include here.    </p>    <p>      And please notice that we've avoided the concept of wild      animal "pets." Wild animals weren't born to be pets any      more than you were, and they don't make good ones.      Neighbors, probably. Friends, possibly. But pets ... no.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAFETY FIRST!</strong>    </p>          <p>        If there's one thing all our contacts agreed on, it's        that <em>your safety</em> comes <em>first.</em> Wild        animals, even those that appear cute and cuddly, can be        dangerous ... and all other considerations aside, you're        not likely to be of much help to a wounded animal if        you're in trouble yourself In most cases a wild creature        will perceive you as still another danger in an already        painful and possibly life-threatening situation and is        apt to strike out in selfdefense. An attack by an injured        heron can easily put out an eye, and an enraged or        terrified opossum has some 50 razor-sharp teeth ready to        embed in your hand. In addition to attack, there's the        very real possibility that disease could be transmitted        to you or to your pets.      </p>      <p>        All in all, then, you should study any situation as        thoroughly as possible <em>before</em> you get directly        involved. Careful observation can spare you and the        animal unnecessary injury; it can also prevent you from        abducting a perfectly healthy wild baby that's simply        following orders and waiting for momma. Wild creatures        don't hire baby-sitters! Their little ones are trained to        stay put while the mother hunts or forages for food        nearby. Most authorities agree that unless the baby is        hurt or obviously distressed, you should observe        it-at a distance-over a period of no less        than two hours. Try to make <em>sure</em> you really are        dealing with a foundling before you pick it up.      </p>      <p>        One of the best ways to move an abandoned youngster is to        use an implement such as a shovel or a piece of cardboard        to <em>gently</em> coax or scoop the animal into a box or        bag. Another way is to toss a light blanket, towel, or        heavy jacket over the creature, gather it into a bundle,        and deposit it carefully in some type of sturdy        container. (Do <em>not</em> carry such a bundle near your        face.) To avoid the danger of overheating or smothering        the animal, slide the coverings off as you ease it into a        box. Close the flaps-or if it's a sack, tie off the        opening-tightly, but make sure there are vents of        some kind for air.      </p>      <p>        It's important to confine a very active animal so it        won't do itself harm: Thrashing around can lead to a        broken leg or wing. For this reason an enveloping sack is        sometimes the best container, or a rope-wound blanket can        also be used. Just be certain that the wrapping isn't too        tight for good circulation and that the animal can        breathe freely and easily.      </p>      <p>        People who are involved in wildlife rescue generally        carry in their cars some extra-heavy leather gloves (such        as foundry workers wear), a blanket, and a box prepared        with ventilation holes and a soft, smooth cloth liner        <em>...</em> just in case they happen upon a wounded or        orphaned animal that needs to be taken to a veterinarian        or other facility for care. Most rescue encounters,        however, seem to take place between an unprepared (though        compassionate) passerby and an injured animal in need of        immediate attention. If this is your experience, you can        do one of two things. [1] You can make a mental note of        the area and as many pertinent details as possible, and        then quickly report your find to the proper authorities.        These consist of your state wildlife agency, a licensed        rehabilitator (see below for further information), a        local veterinarian, or the local humane society. Or [2]        you can improvise! Injured animals can be picked up in        the same way, generally speaking, as orphaned ones. If        you have a car but no wildlife tools or box, you can use        a folding car-seat pad or floor mat as a lifter, while        the trunk can serve as a container. If no car's        available, perhaps you can use a jacket or shirt plus a        bootlace to wrap the bundle with.      </p>      <p>        Whatever you do, keep your movements calm, deliberate,        and nonthreatening. Plan your approach before you move.        Avoid looking directly into the animal's eyes: Many        creatures consider this an aggressive act. Handle your        patient gently but firmly. And if you have any doubts or        misgivings about moving the animal, don't move it. Report        it, and let experienced handlers take over.      </p>      <p>        Assuming you have confined the wildling, take it to a        licensed facility, if you know of one, or to safe        temporary quarters to wait until it can be transferred to        a game warden or other authorized person. Darkness and        quiet are calming influences, so it's best to put your        patient in a quiet, well-ventilated room with subdued        light. Keep the animal warm: A small bird or mammal can        be cradled in your hands, while for other animals you        might suspend a light bulb over one corner of a box,        place a heating pad-set on "low"-underneath        the box (not the animal), or lay a hotwater bottle        wrapped in soft toweling inside the box where the animal        can nestle against it.      </p>      <p>        Isolate your new patient from all household pets and        other people. Offer water, drop by drop (never force food        or drink of any kind down an animal's throat). Note as        many symptoms and characteristics as you can, and if you        hadn't been able to reach your state wildlife agency or        nearby rehabilitator earlier, call now for further        assistance. <em>Don't delay!</em>      </p>      <p>        <strong>HANDS-OFF SITUATIONS</strong>      </p>      <p>        Some animals, like elk, bears, or cougars, are just too        large or too dangerous for any but experienced, trained        personnel to handle. And unless you're a veterinarian or        experienced wildlife official, or you know for certain        that injury, not illness, is responsible for an animal's        condition, stay clear of any wild creature that's        behaving oddly: acting tame, walking unsteadily, or        having convulsions. The problem could be epilepsy,        distemper ... or rabies, which is still considered an        incurable disease. Contact the authorities as quickly as        possible and let them handle the situation.        (Incidentally, if an animal suspected of having rabies        must be destroyed, it should <em>not</em> be shot in the        head, as this must be sent to a lab for analysis.)      </p>      <p>        <strong>WHILE YOU'RE WAITING</strong> . . .      </p>      <p>        Many agencies advise lay rescuers not to offer food to an        injured animal but to wait until professional help        arrives. Although this avoids the problems created by        improper diets and clumsy, perhaps harmful, feeding        techniques, Jeanne Milewski challenges the policy,        pointing out that many wild animals are found only when        they're on the verge of death by starvation. Support for        her belief lives in a comfortable pen at the American        Wildlife Rescue Service in Scotts Valley, California: an        old female bobcat, hit by a truck at the county dump a        year ago Christmas because she was too feeble from        starvation to get out of the way. "She knew that we were        helping her," says Jeanne. "She suffered a broken hip,        and right from the start she was very, very easy to        handle." Today, her health restored, the little cat is        still gentle and obviously happy to be where she is given        regular-and in her case, permanent-care.        "Food and warmth can spell the difference between life        and death," Jeanne declares flatly. She encourages        rescuers to cuddle and cradle chilled birds and small        mammals as soon as they're found, since they're unable to        survive for long without an external heat source.      </p>      <p>        To feed or not to feed ... it's a dilemma, and we don't        have any pat answer. Perhaps the best solution lies in        using one's common sense and trying to follow the        doctor's dictum "Do no harm." Try to get hold of a        veterinarian or licensed rehabilitator right away:      </p>      <p>        He or she can advise you whether feeding is indicated and        tell you which ingredients, utensils, and techniques have        proved the most reliable for the type of animal you're        holding. They can also help with emergency procedures if        the ideal equipment isn't immediately available. If you        can't reach an experienced rehabilitator, perhaps you can        get hold of one or two of the recommended books which        contain valuable advice. Both <em>My Orphans of the        Wild</em> and <em>The Complete Care of Orphaned or        Abandoned Baby Animals</em> contain food formulas, while        <em>Care of the Wild Feathered and Furred</em> has a very        good chart listing natural foods for almost 100 different        animals, together with suitable substitutes.      </p>      <p>        If neither authorized personnel nor books are available,        and you need to act right away, here are two things to        keep in mind:      </p>      <p>        [1] Avoid feeding cow's milk to infant mammals (or to any        birds). It causes diarrhea ... a leading killer of wild        orphans. The Spauldings (see book list below) have had        good luck with goat's milk. Rosemary Collett speaks of        using Borden Company's Esbilac (a powdered formula made        for puppies, kittens, and other small animals) mixed with        cool boiled water and usually supplemented with vitamin        drops. In an emergency-and for a short period        only-Rosemary has used evaporated milk as a        substitute for the Esbilac. The proportions of these        mixes vary according to the size and species of the        animal receiving them, and have been arrived at through        much trial and error: In general, however, try the        Esbilac mixed with water in a ratio of 1:3, or the        evaporated milk mixed with water in a ratio of 1:1 or        1:2.      </p>      <p>        [2] Never feed hamburger to a wild animal. In fact, avoid        feeding beef, period. Carnivores e at their prey in its        entirety: Ground meat is just not an adequate substitute        for whole mouse! If meat is absolutely required, try        natural things like earthworms and mealworms, fresh road        kills, or organ meats such as chicken heart or gizzard.        Incidentally, moistened quality dog kibble can be used as        a temporary diet for many species of birds and mammals.      </p>      <p>        These few suggestions are made with trepidation, and only        because emergencies do arise when trained helpers just        aren't available.      </p>      <p>        <strong>REHABILITATION AND RELEASE</strong>      </p>      <p>        The rehabilitation of wild animals requires study,        training, and-perhaps most difficult of        all-self-discipline. It also requires long hours,        hard work, a considerable outlay of cash, and to a        greater or lesser degree, alterations in one's home and        lifestyle. Few people are up to the task. Injured animals        need constant checking and care-orphaned wildlings may        need to be fed every two hours around the clock-and        often require regular applications of medicine or therapy        of some sort, and possibly special diets. Even animals        that are ready for release are demanding: They must be        fed (sometimes via special techniques to reinforce their        hunting or foraging skills), kept clean, and prevented        from doing themselves or others any harm while waiting        for the right moment for release.      </p>      <p>        In spite of the difficulties, there are many people who        "hear the call" and become enmeshed in the work. If        you're interested in becoming a rehabilitator or in        contacting one near your area, you might begin by phoning        your state wildlife agency for the names and addresses of        local groups or individuals. Not all state wildlife        agencies have this information, however, and you may need        to write for assistance. The Wildlife Rehabilitation        Council, a nationwide network with headquarters at P.O.        Box 3007, Walnut Creek, CA 94598, can put you in touch        with members in your region. Another organization is the        National Wildlife Rehabilitators Association, c/o        Treehouse Wildlife Center, RR 1, Box 125E, Brighton, IL        62012, which has held several symposia on the subject.        Lectures, university courses, and two- or three day        seminars may be offered in your area (see sidebar);        contact your local nature centers, state wildlife        agencies, universities, or humane societies to find out        if and when these might be given. One thing is        immediately apparent: Centralization of information is        still desperately needed.      </p>      <p>        Never underestimate the work these peo ple do. Most of        them started with only a little knowledge but a great        deal of compassion ... and learned-sometimes at        painful cost-that love and hope and care aren't        always enough, but knowledge and training, combined with        determination and a firm but gentle touch, can help. If        we thrill to the sight of a soaring hawk, if we are        awestruck by the grace and beauty of the deer, the otter,        or the tiny jumping mouse, we might remember the people        who reach out every day to help these fellow creatures        when they are wounded, sick, or lost.      </p>      <p>        <strong>KEEP IT LEGAL</strong>      </p>      <p>        There are laws to protect wildlife and the people who        become involved with them. State permits are required in        order to have most species of wild animal legally in your        possession. Federal-and, in many cases,        state-permits are required for you to have any bird        other than a house sparrow or starling. (Technically it's        illegal for anyone without such a permit to pick up an        injured bird, though few game wardens would be inclined        to press the issue if you were trying to save the        creature's life.)      </p>      <p>        One reason for such laws is to protect wild youngsters        from being kidnapped from their homes. Another is to        protect wildlings-especially predators-from        seizure by people who believe that possession of such        animals imbues the owner with some sort of macho or        exotic appeal. Aside from the inherent cruelty of        capturing and confining wild animals who were born to run        free, to hunt, and to interrelate with others of their        species, such possession entails the problem of control.        Many creatures are not only unable to be house-trained,        but unable to be trained at all. Some owners have the        unfortunate animals definged and declawed, thus dooming        them to perpetual custody or death. All too often the        once-proud owners discover that the care and expense        involved in maintaining a wild animal are so great that        they want to get rid of the creature.      </p>      <p>        Wild animals that have been treated like pets can neither        be returned to the wild nor placed in a normal public        zoological park with others of their kind. They don't        have the skills-and sometimes the fundamental        equipment-to survive. Our laws are inadequate and        enforcement is close to nonexistent, but the purpose of        the regulations is to protect against harm. So unless        you're familiar with the laws, you should check with your        local branch of the state wildlife office <em>before</em>        you get involved in an encounter with a wild animal.      </p>      <p>        If you're going to help, make it legal.      </p>      <p>        <strong>A PLACE IN THE CHOIR</strong>      </p>      <p>        For many people the question in all this is, Why bother?        Some people get involved through their fundamental sense        of purpose in life and their spiritual beliefs. Others        have more practical reasons: Wildlife, they point out, is        an integral part of the natural world in which we live        and is essential in maintaining nature's balance, even        though we aren't always very perceptive about the role of        certain creatures. And, of course, without a healthy        wildlife population, hunting and fishing would be        pointless exercises.      </p>      <p>        Everyone's entitled to his or her own reasons. One that        is simple and most satisfying can be said in four words:        Do it for joy. As folksinger Bill Staines sees it, we're        all here together, singing up a storm of praise.      </p>      <p>        All God's critters got a place in the choir<br />        Some sing low, some sing higher<br />        So me sing out loud on the telephone wires,<br />        And some just clap their hands,<br />        Or paws,<br />        Or anything they got now.      </p>      <p>        Books that MOTHER found particularly informative (and        entertaining, as well) include the following:      </p>      <p>        <em>My Orphans of the Wild</em> by Rosemary Collett with        Charlie Briggs (J.B. Lippincott Co., NY, 1974). This        book, possibly the most useful of all, is currently out        of print. A few copies may still be available from        Felicidades Wildlife Foundation, P.O.

Such a person is        Jeanne Milewski', founder-director of the American        Wildlife Rescue Service, an independent, state-authorized        organization located at 1296 Conference Drive, Scotts        Valley, CA 95066 (4081335-3232 or 335-2155). Backed by        Jeanne's remarkable rate of success, AWRS has been in        operation for 16 years.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>Articulate, imaginative, and intense, Jeanne is        something of a maverick, unwilling to accept funds or        affiliations that would dictate terms on the animals she        takes in such as requiring A WRS to euthanize severely        wounded, sick, or intractable animals before she's had a        chance to work with them. Jeanne herself says of A WRS        that it's "the last stop before the bullet"... and she        means it. The organization was incorporated as a        zoological park so that, bylaw, they are able to keep        healthy, but permanently handicapped, animals. While her        primary goal with injured and orphaned wildlings is to        cure or raise them and release them, Jeanne has kept        unreleasable animals for over fifteen years, providing        them with constant personal care in a kind of retirement        home atmosphere. Sometimes, Jeanne says as she gazes        around at the menagerie A WRS has maintained faithfully        over the years, she feels it's an animal geriatric        center!</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>AWRS isn't fancy. Virtually every structure in the        place has been put together by volunteers with donated        materials, but the priorities are clear. The office may        be a ramshackle little cabin hardly bigger than an        outhouse, but Clyde, the neutered, de-clawed African lion        who was someone's backyard</em> <em>"pet" for eight        years, has a fine, large outdoor pen with shelter from        the sun, a house den, and a huge, rubber-coated steel        wrecking ball, which he totes around as a plaything.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>Sometimes the financially pressed service seems to        run on faith alone. "We have people who call up and say,        'I can't do anything else for you, but I'll pray for you,        ' "Yeanne says. "That helps. There are many times when        prayer has saved this organization, you know.

Wildlife        rehabilitators and photographers for 20 years and        recipients of numerous awards, they've come to believe        more and more in the vital need for environmental        education. Traveling in "The Ark" and "The Dom, " their        van and trailer, they take time out from their work with        animals to tour various states every year with lectures        and intensive 2-1/2 day courses on the nitty-gritty of        wildlife rehabilitation.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>Rosemary, author of numerous articles and My</em>        Orphans of the Wild <em>(see end of main article), is a        dynamic and entertaining speaker</em> - <em>keen,        well-organized, and knowledgeable. Lectures and courses,        crammed with detail and broad in scope, are spiced with        beautiful slides and introductions to one or more of the        wildlife helpers who accompany them on the tours: animals        who, for one reason or another, may not be released to        the wild. Denied full freedom, they are active and        endearing participants in the education of thousands of        people.</em>      </p>      <p>        <em>"Our aim is to teach others to care, " she says,        "because that's where it all begins."</em>      </p>
