                    <h5 id="byline">      By Kathy Zserai    </h5>        <p>      Up Until last summer, MOTHER Eco-Village wasn't equipped      with a facility suitable for food preparation. In seasons      past, we hired outside caterers to provide our visitors      with quality meals and snacks. Some of these services)      worked out well Others did not. Seeking a more reliable and      permanent solution (one in keeping with MOM's philosophy)      to our culinary quandary we decided that if you want to do      something right, you just have to do it yourself. The      outcome: Last year MOTHER's own restaurant opened at the      Eco-Village ... to rave reviews, we're pleased to say from      visitors and staff alike.    </p>    <p>      We cooks at MOM's eatery not only provided folks with      delicious vegetarian (and semi veterinarian) dishes but      also taught show-how's on natural-food- related topics., We      frequently became pupils, too, benefiting from the vast      pool of experiences and suggestions so generously shared by      our guests, The exchange of recipes and ideas between staff      and visitors-not to mention the resulting tasty      dishes-enriched us all.    </p>    <p>      For instance, two of the <em>young</em> visitors who left      us with some very fond memories were Ben Stuki and Casey      Fenyo. Ben, who hails from Mauk, Georgia, was a bright and      competent kitchen helper. Casey was quite good at prepping      vegetables (it's amazing how hard some one will work in      exchange for a few carob brownies), but could disappear      without a trace at the mention of dishwashing.    </p>    <p>      For those readers who didn't get a chance to visit us this      past year (or for those of you who did stop by but forgot      to write down the formulas for your favorite dishes), here      are a few of our most requested recipes. Of course, we hope      you'll come see us in person this season at the Eco-Village      Restaurant and sample our delicacies firsthand. In the      meantime, perhaps this popularly acclaimed menu will tide      you over. Here's to good eating!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>SMOOTHIES</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup of fruit juice (apple orange, papaya, or whatever      you prefer)<br />      6 ice cubes<br />      1 banana (or a peach, a nectarine, or a handful of      strawberries)<br />      1 teaspoon of honey<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla</em>    </p>    <p>      Blend the juice and ice in a blender until the cubes are      liquefied. After adding the fruit, vanilla, and honey,      continue processing until the mixture is smooth. This      should yield approximately 2 cups of sweet, delicious fruit      shake. (This recipe is from Eco-Chef Linda Doyle, who also      contributed MOM's favorite bread in issue 86.)    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Cheese and Herb Salad Dressing</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup of mayonnaise<br />      1/2 cup of chopped parsley<br />      1/4 cup of Parmesan cheese<br />      2 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      1 garlic clove, crushed<br />      1 teaspoon of basil</em>    </p>    <p>      Combine all the ingredients (using milk or buttermilk as a      thinner, if needed) ahead of time and refrigerate so the      flavors have a chance to blend. Then pour the dressing over      your favorite salad at mealtime.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Vegetable Barley Soup</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 onion<br />      1 tablespoon of oil<br />      3 cups of water or vegetable stock<br />      1/2 cup of barley<br />      3 carrots, sliced<br />      1 bunch of broccoli, cut in pieces<br />      3 medium potatoes, diced<br />      2 medium tomatoes, diced<br />      1 teaspoon of basil<br />      1 teaspoon of oregano<br />      1/4 teaspoon of coriander<br />      1/4 teaspoon of dill<br />      1 teaspoon of Spike seasoning sea salt to taste<br />      pinch of parsley, chopped<br />      pinch of mint, chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      First, saut√© the onion in oil, add the water (or      stock) and barley, and bring the mixture to a boil. Then      reduce the heat and simmer until the barley is almost done      (approximately 20 minutes). Add the vegetables and spices      and continue to simmer until The vegetables are tender.      (NOTE: You can use almost any vegetables you want in this      soup. Here at MOM's restaurant we just add whatever goodies      our gardens are yielding at the time.) Add the fresh      parsley and mint just before serving. This pot should give      you about 8 to 10 steaming bowlfuls.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Chick-Pea Spread (for Sandwiches or      Dip)</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>3/4 cup of chick-peas (garbanzo beans), cooked<br />      2 garlic cloves, crushed<br />      1 teaspoon of basil<br />      6 to 8 tablespoons of lemon juice<br />      1/2 teaspoon of oregano<br />      1 teaspoon of sea salt<br />      1/2 cup of tahini<br />      1/2 to 1 cup of water or bean liquid</em>    </p>    <p>      Combine everything <em>but</em> the water (or bean liquid)      in a blender and process until smooth. Then gradually add      the liquid until the mixture reaches the desired      consistency for dipping or spreading. (NOTE: Here at the      Eco-Village we serve this special spread on bread with a      slice of Swiss cheese, a slice of tomato, and a topping of      our "super sprouts" a combination of clover, alfalfa, and      fenugreek.)    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Honey Carob Cake</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>2/3 cup of butter<br />      1-1/4 cups of honey<br />      1/3 cup of carob powder<br />      2 eggs<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla<br />      2-1/2 cups of flour<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons of baking soda<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 cup of milk</em>    </p>    <p>      Cream the butter first and then gradually blend in the      honey. Next, add the carob powder and mix well. Beat in the      eggs and vanilla and finally add the dry ingredients-a      little at a time, mixing in some milk with each      addition-and beat till smooth. Now, pour the batter into      greased 8-inch round cake pans and bake at 325'F for about      50 minutes (or until a toothpick poked into the middles      comes out clean). When done, turn the steaming layers onto      a rack to cool. And while you wait, prepare the following      frosting to top off your cake:    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Minty Cream Cheese Frosting</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>1 8-ounce package of cream cheese, softened<br />      3 tablespoons of honey<br />      2 tablespoons of juice (orange, we're told, is tastiest) or      milk<br />      1 teaspoon of mint extract</em>    </p>    <p>      Mix all the ingredients together and beat till smooth and      fluffy (NOTE: If you're a carob-lover, try adding a      tablespoon of carob powder to the above ingredients.) When      your cake has cooled, ice it with this tasty topping and      sit back to enjoy all the compliments you'll undoubtedly      get from your satisfied family and friends!    </p>
