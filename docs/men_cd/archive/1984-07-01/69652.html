                <p>      <em>If you're a parent with the traveling fever, you can      keep on truckin'. . . with your tot in tow!</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">By Pam Prescott</h5>        <p>      Are you a hiking parent faced with the problem of what to      do with Baby while you trek the wilds? It seems that a lot      of folks who don't have access to grandparents-or to      other free, long-term baby-sitters-often just resign      themselves to non backpacking lives until their young      sprouts are big enough to tag along under their own steam.      At least, that's what my husband and I were on the verge of      doing ... when we figured out an easy, inexpensive way to      convert a frame backpack to perform double duty as a      carrier for our son.    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, our young'un rides comfortably and safely in the      top portion of my pack, with his legs dangling through      special openings, while the pack's bottom and side pouches      still tote camping gear. In fact, I've found this      arrangement to be so handy and comfortable (for me, as well      as my tot) that I even use it for running around-town      errands. I can carry my child and my purchases on my back,      and be free of the hassles that usually go with trying to      shop and keep track of a toddler simultaneously.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HERE'S THE HOW-TO OF IT</strong>    </p>    <p>      The conversion takes only a few minutes and an investment      of about $3.00 ... and it leaves your pack virtually      unharmed for "normal" (that is, nonkid) carrying. But in      order for this alteration to work, you'll need an      external-frame pack that has two main compartments in back      ... an upper and a lower. Luckily, since this two-pocket      arrangement is a fairly common style for this type of      carrier, you shouldn't have trouble locating one (if you're      not already so equipped). Your child will be riding on the      base, or "floor" of the upper compartment, with his or her      legs dangling in toewiggling freedom through slits cut into      the pack material and reinforced with Velcro-type tape.    </p>        <p>      All that's required-besides a pack and a child, of      course-is a 2" -wide strip of the self adhering tape, about      18" long (measure the width of the back of your pack to      determine the exact length of the strip you'll need).    </p>    <p>      Separate the two sides of the tape, and sew the portion      with the soft, fuzzy surface horizontally across the      outside of your carrier, aligned just above the base of the      top compartment. Remove the pack from its frame and sew the      edges of the strip securely to the sack's material.    </p>    <p>      Now mark the horizontal center point of the tape and then      start your leg-slit measurements an inch or two on either      side of the mark (as shown in the diagram). Next, draw a      straight line about 6 inches long for each of the leg      openings, and zigzag with your machine-or      hand-sew-securely around the marks to insure that the      material doesn't rip or unravel.    </p>    <p>      Finally, cut along the lines to open the slits, trimming      off any ragged edges that might rub against tender young      skin ... and you're finished!    </p>    <p>      <strong>ON THE TRAIL AGAIN!</strong>    </p>        <p>      Your youngster can now ride along on your family's      foot-powered outings, and the remainder of your pack will      be free for equip ment stashing. Of course, you'll have to      pack carefully in order to fit in Baby, his or her special      necessities, and your own goods ... but I've learned a few      space-saving tricks that should help.    </p>    <p>      First, wrap spare diapers around the metal bar at the top      of the pack frame. This not only protects the child's head      from bumps, but also saves space <em>in</em> the pack.      Cloth diapers take up less space than disposables, and just      a couple should get you through the day if they're rinsed      out and pinned to the outside of the pack to dry as you      walk.    </p>    <p>      Stuff clothes and other soft items <em>around</em> and      <em>under</em> your child's bottom to provide padded seat      comfort, a snug fit, and the "lift" that very small      children need in order to see over the top of the pack.    </p>    <p>      When hiking through really rugged terrain, you can rig up a      "safety belt" that goes around your little passenger's      waist and fastens to the backpack frame on both sides. And      if you want <em>maximum</em> safety (and peace of mind),      your tyke can even wear a bicyclist's lightweight plastic      helmet.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, any time you're hiking without the child, you      can seal up the leg slits by smacking on the matching      ("hooked") side of the self-adhering tape to return your      backpack to full service! Sure, with human cargo      <em>and</em> your gear in the pack, you'll be bumping a      respectable load. But you and your mate can work out an      equitable distribution of weight ... trade off the      kid-carrying chores ... or hike with friends to spread the      load around even more.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have found it well worth carrying the      extra weight to be back on the trail and in the woods      again. In fact, the joys of being able to share the wonders      of nature with our son has made our "piggyback" backpack      tripping the best ever!    </p>
