                <p>      As waves of summer heat make the soil shimmer and drenching      down pours release the fragrance of the earth, it's the      season to pick bugs, pull weeds, cultivate the soil ... and      look forward to the joys of the harvest.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Peter Hemingson    </h5>    <p>      There's a cornucopia of good news for home gardeners this      month, and much of it concerns organic alternatives for      insect and disease control. Take the catalog of Ringer      Research (Dept. TMEN, 6860 Flying Cloud Dr., Eden Prairie,      MN 55344), for example. In it you'll find such well-known      products as <em>Bacillus thuringiensis</em> (BT or Dipel),      a bacterial insecticide that's effective against      caterpillars, and milky spore, a disease that colonizes and      controls Japanese beetles.    </p>        <p>      But you'll find some less common items, too. A version of      BT called BMC-more scientifically, <em>Bacillus      thuringiensis israeliensis</em> - <em>is</em> offered      as a safe, natural control for the larvae of black flies      and mosquitoes, two pests that can really keep you out of      the garden! The best thing about this special form of BT is      that it has no effect on people, fish, or other creatures:      It just kills <em>larvae.</em> (BMC is also available from      Gurney's Seed & Nursery Co., Yankton, SD 57079.)    </p>    <p>      And then there's Seek, which provides effective control of      root weevils, cutworms, Japanese beetles, some borers, and      other insect pests. Operating much like BT, Seek (actually      living Steinernematid nematodes) lies in wait in the soil      for its enemies. Once contact is made, the      garden-beneficial nematodes enter their victim and effect a      kill in two days. In the process, the nematodes multiply      and send out additional generations for long-lasting      control. Half a pound treats 200 square feet and sells for      about $13.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND MORE . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now that's really good news, you might say. What could be      better? Well , try this: According to a report by Jerry      Bishop in <em>The Wall Street journal,</em> a team of      scientists working on interferon research has identified a      chemical that-at least in laboratory tests-has      proven to be a potent inhibitor of plant viruses. Bishop      says, "If field experiments confirm laboratory experience,      the chemical could be to plant virus diseases what      penicillin is to human bacterial diseases."    </p>    <p>      Stop for a moment and cast your mind over some of the virus      diseases that beset plants: tobacco mosaic (TMV) on such      members of the nightshade family as tomatoes ... bean      mosaic on legumes ... and anthracnose on virtually      everything. In all, there are about 400 known viruses that      affect plants, and the damage they do to commercial crops      has been estimated at between 2 and 10% of the total yield.      Anything that can begin to control such viruses will      clearly be a boon to commercial agriculture ... and also to      the home gardener. just think how often you've had to plant      a disease-resistant hybrid in place of a more flavorful      (but also more vulnerable) standard variety!    </p>    <p>      Jerry Bishop summed up the benefits of the new-synthesized      compound called 2,5-A that is-in its natural      form-produced when interferon comes in contact with animal      cells: "Minute amounts of the chemical sprayed on a plant      can stop a devastating virus infection in less than an      hour. The chemical can be made fairly cheaply in large      volume. More important, it is harmless to the plant ... and      to humans and other animals."    </p>    <p>      2,5-A won't appear on the market for some time. Field      testing for both safety and efficacy must be carried out      before the product can be used in agriculture. (After all,      not everything that initially appears "harmless" turns out      to be so.) But scientists in Israel and West Germany are      cooperating in the work done by researchers at Temple      University Medical School in Philadelphia, and the promise      of 2,5-A seems to grow monthly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND EVEN MORE!</strong>    </p>    <p>      The April edition of <em>The Avant Gardener</em> ($15 for      12 monthly issues from Horticultural Data Processors, Box      489, New York, NY 10028 ... and well worth it!) brings good      news about a systemic fungicide that stimulates plants to      develop their own natural defense mechanism against downy      mildews and phytophthora. Called Aliette, the product is      labeled for vegetables and fruits as a soil drench or      foliar spray. It's available from E.C. Geiger, Box 285,      Harleysville, PA 19438.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE SECOND SEASON</strong>    </p>    <p>      When you're faced with harvesting the bumper crop from your      first planting, it's sometimes difficult to turn your      thoughts to a fall harvest. But this is the time to put out      seedlings of such healthful, fiber rich vegetables as      cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, and brussels sprouts. (The      garden calendar on page 180 of MOTHER NO. 70 gives full      details about planting dates and suggests some cultivars.)    </p>    <p>      Last year, aided in large part by our drip irrigation      system and black plastic mulch, my wife and I harvested      broccoli well into December and brussels sprouts in January      ... and we live in New York State! In all, I would have to      rate the black-plastic-mulched/drip-irrigated garden I've      been experimenting with as an unqualified success. (I first      described it in "A Drip at a Time," MOTHER NO. 82, page      32.) It was a difficult growing year, with heavy rain all      spring and then weeks without a shower in the summer, but      the black plastic cover kept the soil from getting sodden      in excessively wet weather, while the drip system delivered      moisture to the plants very efficiently during the extended      dry spell.    </p>    <p>      Our garden is (of necessity) located in an area that was      formerly a farmhouse garbage dump, and broken glass and      clamshells still surface in the growing patch with      dismaying regularity. Under these circumstances, I tried      out the sturdy black plastic Submatic tubing (available      from Submatic, P.O. Box 246, Lubbock, TX 79408) and found      it to be better than the more fragile, paper like"oozing      tape" from Irrigro (1555 Third Ave., Niagara Falls, NY      14304). The latter occasionally suffered cuts that required      repair. Under more ordinary conditions, though, I think      that both systems work well, with the Itrigro having a      marginal advantage for row crops, since it weeps water      along its entire length rather than from emitters placed at      two foot intervals.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, I'm now a thoroughgoing convert to drip      irrigation!    </p>
