                		<p>      <em><strong>A guide to the magical, mystical stuff under      our feet.</strong></em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Mort Mather    </h5>        <p>      Photos: All America Selections    </p>        <p>      An old farmer told me years ago that It was time to plant      corn when it felt comfortable to walk bare-footed in the      garden. That was right up my alley, as I greatly dislike      shoes. Have YOU ever thought about how foolish it is to      take the hide from a dead animal and put it on your feet      where it will soon wear out, while if you walk barefoot      your living skin gets tougher? In our modern world of      pavement and broken glass it's not always practical or safe      to walk without shoes. Ah, but in the garden. When I stand      in the garden in bare feet I feel plugged into the earth.      It seems as if my feet are communicating with the soil in      some way. The soil pushing up against my flat arches and      molding to, my feet is very comforting ... I would even say      mystical lout then people would start laughing.    </p>    <p>      I believe we know more about the surface of the moon than      we know about the surface of the earth-not because we      haven't tried to understand what is going on immediately      under our feet, but because there is so much going on.    </p>    <p>      A number of years ago I read a book entitled <em>Soil</em>      <em>Microbiology</em> by Selman A. Waksman, Professor of      Microbiology at Rutgers University (John Wiley & Sons,      Inc., 1952). It is a compilation of research that had been      done on soil microbiology up to that time. What I found      most fascinating about this book was the frustration the      scientists experienced as they struggled to understand soil      life by counting microbes. The damn things would change      before they could count them. The minute they disrupted the      soil by taking a sample or separating elements from it, the      soil microorganisms would change.    </p>    <p>      "The soil is not a mass of dead debris, merely resulting      from the physical and chemical weathering of rocks; it is a      more or less homogeneous system which has resulted from the      decomposition of plan and animal remains. It is teeming      with life. The numerous living forms which spend all or      part of their life in the soil range from the      sub-microscopic viruses and phages, through the microscopic      bacteria, actinomycetes, fungi, algae, and protozoa, to the      lower animal forms, the worms, insects, and rotifers, many      of which can be seen and recognized with the naked eye.      These organisms, comprising both the living forms and their      dead bodies, as well as the products of their      decomposition, such as carbon dioxide and organic acids,      interact with the rock constituents to give rise to soil.      The soil thus gains the characteristic properties that make      it a suitable medium for plant and animal life" (Soil      Microbiology, Preface).    </p>    <p>      As I stand bare-footed in my garden there are more      individual living microbes under just one foot than there      are people in New York City ...and I don't have especially      large feet. That is a bit more than I can comprehend. It is      time to take Thoreau's advice and "simplify."    </p>    <h3>ALL-AMERICA SEED SELECTIONS FOR SPRING,      1998</h3>        <p>      For the past 65 years, All-America Selections (AAS) has      taken the guesswork out of finding flower and vegetable      varieties that are reliable, productive, and that show      marked improvement over other varieties currently      available. There are four award winners for 1998.    </p>    <p>      Bright Lights (Swiss chard) offers a striking array of      colors. Plant stems can be yellow, gold, orange, pink,      violet, or striped in addition to the standard red or      white. It also has a milder chard flavor. Bright Lights      seeds are normal, multi-seeded fruits typical of beets or      chard, and are usually sown in prepared garden soil in the      spring or fall. Chard is easy to grow from seed and is      widely adapted to a variety of growing conditions. Young      plants may tolerate light frosts without damage. Harvest      can begin in about 4 or 5 weeks for young salad greens, but      either young or mature leaves should be taken just above      the soil line so that the plants can grow back for multiple      harvests.    </p>    <h3>Clay, Sand, or Silt?</h3>    <p>      The simplest way to begin studying your soil is to      understand its texture. Rub some of it between a finger and      thumb. If it is gritty, your soil is sandy. If it is greasy      feeling, you have a clay soil. If you can't make up your      mind, you have a silt. All you are doing is putting a name      to particle size.    </p>    <p>      A sandy soil will let water drain through it quickly. This      is great in the spring when people with heavier soils are      waiting for the garden to dry enough to work but it is a      problem in a dry spell. The particles of a clay soil are so      close together that water has great difficulty getting      through at all. Not only is a clay soil the latest to work      but if you work it early you will turn it into a dumpy mess      that you will regret for the rest of the summer.    </p>    <p>      To test my soil to determine when it is ready to work, I      scoop up a handful and squeeze it into a ball. Then I hold      the ball between a finger and thumb and squeeze. If it      crumbles, the soil is ready. You can imagine how easily a      ball of sand would crumble if you could even get it to hold      together in the first place, while a ball of clay would      fiercely resist breaking apart.    </p>    <p>      With the addition of organic matter, our soil becomes loam,      whether it is sandyloam, siltloam, or clay-loam. The      organic matter (mostly plant and animal residue) breaks      down through the action of, you guessed it, micro and macro      organisms. Now we are back into the complex stuff again, so      rather than do that, lets just accept that the plant and      animal material becomes humus and that humus is magic      stuff.    </p>    <p>      Magic? Yeah, magic! The problem with sandy soil is that it      doesn't hold water, won't hold together, and has too much      air. Humus binds the large particles together and fills in      the air pockets with a sponge-like material that will hold      water. Reasonable, not magic. But get this: the problem      with day soil is that it holds water like a bathtub, it      sticks together like bubble gum, and the particles are so      close together that plant roots can't breathe. Humus pushes      the particles apart with a sponge like material that allows      air and water to move between the particles.    </p>    <p>      Of course humus also improves a silt soil. In other words,      we should be adding organic mater to our garden soil all      the time to make it better. Why did we have to know if it      was sandy or clayey? We didn't. However, sometime you may      be in a conversation with someone and the topic of soil may      come up and they may ask you what kind of soil you have.      You will know and they will not be able to pull any of that      superiority stuff on you. They wouldn't have asked you for      any other reason unless you were complaining about not      being able to work the ground until late in the spring or      about having to water the garden when it was dry.    </p>    <h3>ALL AMERICAN SEEDS ELECTIONS VICTORIAN ROSE</h3>        <p>      Victorian Rose (Impatiens F1) is the first impatiens with      consistently semi-doubling flowers. The unique, distinct      qualities of Victorian Rose are the semi-double blooms and      the number of blooms. Its flowers contain extra petals,      adding depth to each rose bloom. More importantly, the      flowering capability exceeds that of similar plants. This      old-fashioned rose is a soft, muted color which combines      easily with other annuals, and initial AAS trials indicate      good season-long performance as well. Victorian Rose      performs best in a shady garden and will adapt to any      container. Like all impatiens, it needs little care in the      garden, only sufficient water to maintain color.    </p>    <h3>The Problem of pH</h3>    <p>      The next pretty simple thing we can get into is the soil      pH, the scale by which acidity-alkalinity is measured. The      numerical values of the scale run from 1 to 14. Seven is      considered neutral, below 7 is acid, and above is alkaline.      You can get a quick idea of the pH of your soil by just      giving it a taste. A sour soil is acid, a bitter soil is      alkaline, and a sweet soil is neutral. You are looking for      a fairly sweet soil with just the hint of sour.    </p>    <p>      You can get more scientific by buying a soil test kit or      sending a sample of your soil off to the cooperative      extension at most state universities, and they will be      tickled to serve you in the hope that you will become a      supporter in these times of budget cuts. In Maine a soil      test costs $10 per sample and it takes about three weeks to      get the results back. The Cooperative Extension will also      give you recommendations for correcting the pH. It is      really a worthwhile service, but only if you have the test      done ear ly enough in the year. Grab a handful now and have      it tested before planting.    </p>    <p>      If you were my neighbor and you came to me in the spring      asking what you should do for a new garden, I would tell      you that your pH was probably below 5.5 and that you should      spread 150 to 200 pounds of limestone per 1,000 square feet      of garden. However, if you live in Lincoln, Nebraska, that      is terrible advice. What I am suggesting is that you seek      advice in the neighborhood if you need some instant      guidance.    </p>    <p>      The goal is to get the pH to about 6.5 for most crops. You      may find a listing of vegetables that will give you optimum      pH for each plant. Forget that, except for perennials like      the berry patch which can stand to be more acidic, the      asparagus patch which can be a little on the alkaline side,      and potatoes ...which I'll get to later.    </p>    <p>      Let me go back to my off- the-cult recommendation icy IM      theoretical new neighbor. In addition to the lime, I would      recommend that he or she spread manure (mixed with a      bedding of straw, wood shavings, etc.) in generous doses.      Back to the magic. For some strange reason, humus broadens      the range of pH within which plants will grow well.    </p>    <p>      By the way, pH means hydrogen-ion activity. If you thought      I was on the fringe of my understanding with microbiology,      I'm beyond the fringe when it comes to ions. Ions are      electrically charged atoms or molecules formed by the loss      or gain of one or more electrons. Ammonium (one of the      forms nitrogen can have), potassium, calcium, magnesium,      and most micronutrients are cations which means they have a      positive charge. Soil particles are negatively charged and      since opposites attract, these nutrients attach themselves      to soil particles. Plant roots moving through the soil give      off hydrogen ions which are positively charged. These      hydrogen ions are very pushy. They attach themselves to the      soil particles and bump the nutrient off. The nutrient, now      a positive charge looking for a place to go, attaches      itself to the root and is then absorbed into the plant.    </p>    <p>      The bottom line is that you want to have a lot of surfaces      in the soil with negative charges that will latch onto the      positively charged nutrients. A pH in the neutral range      improves the cation exchange capability of the soil. Guess      what else will make a great improvement? That magic      substance, humus. It increases the surfaces to which      cations can attach themselves while they wait to be bumped      by a hydrogen ion.    </p>    <p>      Nitrates (a form of nitrogen that plants can use) and      phosphates do not attach themselves to soil particles      electrically. They are water sol uble. Plants absorb these      nutrients with their water. Humus is there again playing a      role in holding nutritious water in the topsoil where the      roots can find it.    </p>    <p>      This is really fascinating stuff, but it is a lot more than      you need to know. Just add lots of organic matter and      correct the pH every two or three years. If the pH needs to      be raised and you add crushed limestone, the limestone will      act like slow release capsules over a three year period.    </p>    <h3>ALL-AMERICA SEED SELECTIONS SWEET DANI LEMON      BASIL</h3>        <p>      Sweet Dani Lemon Basil is an improved aromatic herb, most      noteworthy for its strong lemon scent. The scent is      released when the plant is lightly touched, and was      accentuated by the purposeful breeding of plants with high      essential oil and citral content. Easy to grow from either      seed or plants, Sweet Dani needs warm temperatures for      rapid growth. In the full-sun herb garden, its plants are      uniform, fully branching to provide more leaves for      harvest. Gardeners can expect a mature plant height of      about 26 inches with white flower spikes appearing late in      the growing season, and the plants can be cut back or      trimmed for harvest several times with good regrowth.    </p>    <h3>Low pH Plants ...and Troublemakers</h3>    <p>      Potatoes are the only crop I think of when I think of pH.      Among those millions of soil microorganisms there are      several that cause scab on potatoes. Scab is to a potato      what a cold sore is to us, an unattractive rough spot.      Potatoes with scab can be stored just fine and they are      fine eating but their appearance doesn't stir the appetite      so they typically can't be sold. You might not want to put      a scabby baked potato on the table either.    </p>    <p>      But scab is easy for commercial growers to control. At a pH      below 5.3 the number of scabbed tubers drops below 2% and      below pH 5.0 there is no growth of scab organisms. Since      potatoes will grow well at a pH in this range, all the      grower needs to do is keep the pH below 5.3. We gardeners      are trying to grow several crops in the same soil, rotating      them each year so the same plant is not looking for the      same nutrients in the same place year after year. What to      do?    </p>    <p>      The Maine Soil Testing Service has this advice: "Grow      scab-resistant varieties: Russet Burbank, Superior,      Norland, Belrus, or Waseon. Reserve an area for potatoes      and grow in rotation with sweet corn. Maintain reserve area      at pH 5.5, remaining garden at pH 6.5:" That was on the      soil test results of a sample I sent last fall which showed      the pH in my garden to be 6.6 Sometimes I do plan ahead.    </p>    <p>      I was surprised to find the pH so high since I have not      added lime for several years. I thought that it would be      used up or leached out of the soil by now and that I would      have to replenish it. Not so. I called Bruce Hoskins who      tested my soil al the Maine Soil Testing Service. He said      that the pH was probably staying up because I was using      natural fertilizers. It is the chemical fertilizers that      have the greatest effect on lowering the pH. I asked him      about acid rain and he said its effect was minimal. I may      never have to buy or spread lime again. Good news for a      lazy gardener.    </p>    <p>      That still leaves me with the problem of scab. I used to      work liming into my rotation. I knew where the potatoes      were going to be planted and I didn't lime that area.      According to Bruce's directions I should have kept the lime      off the potato and corn plots and followed the corn with      potatoes in my rotation. There are some other crops that      can't stand a pH down to 5.5. Beans, Brussels sprouts,      carrots, collards, cucumbers, eggplant, garlic, kale,      kohlrabi, parsley, peas, peppers, pumpkins, radishes,      rutabaga, squash, tomatoes, and turnips join corn in this      range Chicory, endive, fennel, shallots, sorrel, sweet      potato, and watermelon join potatoes in tolerating a pH as      low as 5.0. Corn is the most logical choice because it      takes up a lot of area-as do potatoes-but if      you are trying to figure out a four year rotation in which      you use lime or ashes to raise your pH, any of these would      be good choices for the areas that were not limed.    </p>    <p>      I haven't worked up a garden plot for this rotation, but      the grouping might go something like this. Add lime or wood      ashes in one fourth of the garden and plant beets,      broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, chard, Chinese      cabbage, leeks, lettuce, muskmelon, okra, onion, parsnip,      salsify, soybean, and spinach in this area. The second and      third years, plant corn or a mix of the crops listed in the      previous paragraph in this area. The fourth year after      spreading the lime, plant potatoes.    </p>    <p>      While I keep records of what I plant where each year and      how the garden has been fertilized, I have not kept records      on the state of the crop. We have had very scabby potatoes      some years and other years they have been beautiful, so      beautiful I have given them as Christmas presents. Last      year they were scabby and they were planted in, newly      turned sod which received no ashes or lime an, was mulched      with leave which are acidic. Past experience led me to      believe the pH would be low, though I didn't test it. With      a low pH then should have been no scab I thought. It is one      of those mysteries that may never be solved. Unsolved      mysteries in the garden abound. I'm sure it is one of the      reasons I have never become bored with gardening.    </p>    <h3>ALL-AMERICA SEED SELECTION PRISM SUNSHINE</h3>        <p>      Prism Sunshine (Petunia F1) represents numerous improve      ments, but the most significant to us is flower color. This      single grandiflora flower has a creamy yellow color that      neither fades nor blushes pink under stressful garden      conditions. The deep green foliage contrasts with the large      3 to 3 1/2" yellow flowers. Prism Sunshine plants are      vigorous, flowering freely throughout the growing season.      Plants may spread from 15 to 20 inches in the garden,      depending on the available nutrients, sunshine, and      moisture. It seems to thrive in a full-sun garden. Like the      Victorian Rose mentioned above, it is adaptable to      container gardening.    </p>    <p>      The AAS award winners should be available in stores just in      time for March planting.    </p>    <h3>The Garden Multivitamin</h3>    <p>      So much for the pH. Now it's time to get into the rest of      the chemistry lesson. Plants need 16 chemical elements for      healthy growth. If you have been buying chemical      fertilizer, you are well aware of the three that plants      need in greatest quantities and that are not automatically      replaced each year. These are nitrogen (N), phosphate (P),      and potassium (K), good old N-P-K. When a bag of fertilizer      says it is 5-10-10 it means it has 5% nitrogen, 10%      phosphate, and 10% potassium. The next three most important      elements are calcium, magnesium, and sulfur. You have      probably taken care of calcium if your pH is in the proper      range. Sulfur is very rarely a problem. Magnesium is added      to some commercial fertilizers in areas where deficiencies      are common. Those are the six macronutrients.    </p>    <p>      There are seven micronutrients or trace elements: iron,      boron, manganese, zinc, molybdenum, copper, and chlorine.      These are indisputably necessary to the healthy growth of      plants. Fortunately they are available in most soils. The      most likely way these elements might become a problem is if      the pH is above 7.0 or below 5.0 because at these levels      they can become either bound up and not available or too      available and potentially toxic. How can you be sure trace      elements are available to your garden plants? Easy! Just      use the magic ingredient. Keep the humus level up.    </p>    <p>      One of the problems I have as an organic gardener is that      my answers to problems can be boring: witness the above.      That is why I latch onto bits of information or delve into      controversy. An example of the former is that the most      recent trace ele ment discovered to be absolutely necessary      for the healthy growth of plants is molybdenum. For      controversy, selenium was recently "discovered" to be      essential to the healthy growth of plants. This is in      dispute, however. It was tremendously difficult to      determine whether or not any of the trace elements were      essential because the amount needed is so small and because      it is very difficult to grow plants in a completely      controlled environment. Scientists had a terrible time      eliminating single elements to make valid experiments. Some      elements may even be carried over in the seed or seed coat.    </p>    <p>      The importance of selenium may be dispute but not whether      it is necessary to the healthy growth of mammals. And      mammals get it through eating plants.    </p>    <h3>Lastly, but Most Importantly</h3>    <p>      I said there were sixteen essential elements and, if you      have been keeping count, I only named thirteen (four teen      counting selenium). The other three are the most im      portant, and constitute most of what plants are. Hydrogen      and oxygen in the air and as water comprise about nine ty      percent of the plants in the garden. Water is essen tial      for the uptake of some nutrients, most notably nitrogen in      the form of nitrates and phosphates.    </p>    <p>      I have saved the best for last: carbon. There is carbon in      all plants and animals. Forty to fifty percent of organic      mat ter is carbon. Organic chemistry was origi nally the      study of plants and animals and later expanded to include      all chemistry involving carbon. Only.03 percent of the air      is carbon yet all plants must take carbon from air. We      exhale carbon dioxide and plants take it in and "exhale"      oxygen.    </p>    <p>      When organic matter decays, carbon dioxide is released into      the air. Some studies suggest that it may be better to      incorporate organic materials directly in the soil rather      than compost them because this puts more carbon dioxide in      the soil.    </p>    <p>      "Chemistry, soil microbiology, geology ...why do I need to      know all this?" I hear you wondering. You don't. You can go      to the seed and feed store and tell them you want to grow a      garden. They will probably ask you the size and then sell      you some fertilizer, probably a chemical 5-10- 10. If they      are good sales-people, they will sell you some lime,      perhaps hydrated so that it will act faster. That will take      care of the chemicals unless they suggest a pesticide to      kill anything that might eat your plants. If they are into      the geology of the soil they might sell you some peat moss      or other sterile bulk material to improve the soil texture.      You will probably have a reasonably good garden. It will be      better if they tell you how to side-dress the chemical      fertilizer. They ought to tell you something about the      insects so you don't spray beneficial ones.    </p>    <p>      You don't need to know all I have put down here to garden      organically either. I just wrote it to show off and because      I think it is interesting. I also think it is great fun to      know that I can grow a garden in this complex stuff called      soil which is in some ways very mysterious. I love being so      close to something that is still baffling scientists.    </p>    <p>      It has been 14 years since I last tested my soil. The pH      was 6.7 then. Potassium has gone from medium to excessive,      and magnesium from medium to optimum. Phosphorus dropped      back from excessive to optimum as did calcium. Those are      not big changes. This means I can pretty much continue what      I have been doing. The one change I will make is to keep      ashes off the garden and out of the compost until another      test tells me calcium is needed.    </p>    <h3>First Garden First Aid</h3>    <p>      My first soil test in 1972 showed me that the soil was      medium to low in all nutrients and had a pH of 5.3. I      corrected the pH with ground limestone, as recommended on      the soil test. Then I spread cow manure mixed with hay and      tilled that into the soil before I planted. The next year,      I spread seaweed for nitrogen and potassium and rock      phosphate to bring up the phosphate level. The next year I      spread seaweed. All three years I mulched the entire      garden. Then I had the soil tested again.    </p>    <p>      The pH had only risen to 5.7 but all nutrients but calcium      were optimum or close to it. The garden was doing very well      in spite of the low pH, but I limed again to correct it. In      all the soil tests since, the pH has been between 6.3 and      6.7. If I had it to do over again, I don't think I would      lime a garden with 5.7 pH if it was meeting or exceeding my      expectations. The humus, our magic ingredient, widens the      band of pH in which plants will do well. Right now I'm      happy to see the pH drop back a point. I wouldn't want it      to just keep climbing because you can definitely have too      much of a good thing. Remember that a pH above 7.0 will      bind up some of the micronutrients.    </p>    <p>      My soil test says that 8.2 percent organic matter is      excessive. I have had organic matter test as high as 11      percent and I haven't had any reason to feel that it was a      problem. Organic matter can present a problem however:      nutrient deficiency.    </p>    <p>      I had long heard from the proponents of chemical      fertilizers that organic fertilizers would rob the soil of      nitrogen, but I had no such experience. Then one year I      looked out across the garden and saw some clearly unhappy      plants. Since I am pretty casual about the way I spread      manure and other materials, I am used to having spots that      are not as robust as other spots. But this was a large      area. Rows of vegetables going from four or five inches in      height to two or three. Full rows dwindling to scattered      plants in the row. The closer I looked the less I      understood. Then I went upstairs in the house and looked      out at the garden and saw that the poor growth was in a      semicircle on one edge of the garden and I knew what had      caused the problem.    </p>    <p>      That winter, someone had called to say that an elm stump      had been ground up in front of their house. Did I want the      chips? I am a collector of organic matter so I hopped in my      truck and went of the get the chips. For lack of a better      plan I parked the truck at the edge of the garden and      spread the chips as far as I could pitch them from the back      of the truck. They were tilled into the garden along with      everything else in the spring. Out of sight, out of mind.    </p>    <p>      What happened in this part of the garden was that all the      soil microorganisms went to work breaking down the      carbonaceous material, the wood chips. There was a lot of      work to do and so more were needed. It takes nitrogen for      the population of microorganisms to explode, so when my      plants went looking for nitrogen in the soil it was all      being used. Eventually balance was restored. Then, as the      larger population of microorganisms finished the job of      decomposing the wood chips, they died and became a source      of nitrogen to the plants again. The process took too long      for my garden that year, however.    </p>    <p>      If I had been aware of this process, I could have added      some nitrogen. The ratio of carbon to nitrogen should be      about 30 to 1. Most carbonaceous materials are added to the      garden with manure which provides the nitrogen necessary.      The only material that I worried about was horse manure.      Horse owners like to keep their animals very clean and they      usually use wood shavings or sawdust. The carbon-nitrogen      ration of sawdust is about 400 to 1. And horse manure is      only about half a percent nitrogen: you can see why I was      con cerned. You can try doing some math with those figures      to come up with the ratio of horse manure to saw dust if      you like. Myself, I just spread some of the stuff to see      how it would work. Horse manure with wood shavings or with      saw dust has worked fine in my garden. I don't guarantee      that you won't experience a nitrogen deficiency, but, so      far, l haven't.    </p>    <p>      If you do find yourself in that situation, side-dress the      crop with blood meal or cottonseed meal. These are      available at most garden stores and will provide a quick      fix of nitrogen in an emergency. Remember: the current      deficiency is not a loss, just a delay.    </p>    <h3>Commercial vs. Organic Fertilizers</h3>    <p>      Which brings me to the reasons I don't use commercial,      water-soluble fertilizers. First, because they are water      soluble, they won't stay where you put them. You put them      in the topsoil where the roots of your plants need them.      When it rains these water soluble nutrients leach down      below the root zone, and eventually into the groundwater      where you really don't want them. Those who will try to      sell you these fertilizers will tell you that they are      available while most of the phosphate in rock phosphate is      not. True, but that is a plus. The rock phosphate stays      where you put it and the soil acids and microorganisms make      it available to the plants as they need it.    </p>    <p>      The other problem I have with chemical fertilizers is that      they don't need soil microorganisms. You know what happens      to the soil microorganisms when they aren't needed. They      die. They disappear. Chemical fertilizers make it possible      to grow crops in a basically dead soil. Soil like this has      poor tilth; the structure is not good because it doesn't      have that magic ingredient, humus. Sandy soil will lose      more water through it and clay soil will have more water      run off of it. A garden managed this way will need much      more care because it doesn't have the structure to support      itself. It can't retain water in wet periods for the dry      periods.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps worst of all for this gardener, is the feel of a      dead soil under his bare feet. A clay soil feels like      pavement and a sandy soil feels like glass. I also take      great pleasure in letting nature feed and water my garden      all summer, leaving me with nothing to do but protect it      from animals, harvest, and eat the crops as they reach      perfection.    </p>    <h3>SNEAKY SLUG CONTROL</h3>    <p>      Slugs-those wonderful slimy      snails-without-shells-were a serious problem in my      garden for several years. They are good at breaking down      organic matter and they eat very little of the growing      vegetables in the garden but they really tend to turn off a      salad eater. Lettuce, one of my favorite crops, is also one      of theirs. They need wet places. Drying out is death to      them and it is always very moist inside lettuce and cabbage      plants. The large leaves collect the morning dew which      frequently runs down to the lower interior of the plant      making this a wet place through the hottest days.    </p>    <p>      I tried everything I could think of or had read about to      get rid of slugs. If you have had the problem, you are      familiar with the beer traps. Slugs are attracted to a dish      of beer and they will drown in it. What I finally figured      out was that by putting the dishes of beer in the garden I      was attracting slugs from afar. The more I collected in my      traps the more there were. Hint: if you are going to use      traps, place them on the edges of the garden so slugs will      be drawn away rather than into the garden.    </p>    <p>      I put down boards in the walkways. Slugs would collect in      this damp place during the day. I would go out with shoes      on, turn over the board and tramp on the slugs. Messy. But      I could turn back mulch just about anywhere and find clumps      of them. In frustration I would drop handfuls of ashes on      them to dry them to death.    </p>    <p>      Then I finally found a comprehensive solution. First I till      the whole garden in the spring which makes it a bit of a      desert for slugs. Essentially, any that survive the tilling      will leave. Next I mow the grass around the garden and keep      it mowed. Tall grass is almost always wet near the soil.      Short grass dries rapidly in the morning sun. Third, I      don't mulch the lettuce or cabbage. By controlling weeds      through cultivation around these crops, the slugs find the      environment inhospitable. There are still slugs around the      garden and some in the garden but this method has      eliminated them from salads and coleslaw.    </p>    <h3>Hydroponics: the Revolution that Wasn't?</h3>    <p>      Hydroponics is the growing of plants without sc in a      nutrient solution. Plants may be suspender; their roots in      water, with a collar, strings, or some other support. Air      needs to be bubbled through the water and nutrients      provided to the roots in solo ton in the water. Are      agricultural fields without hu earthworms, and other soil      organisms which nutrients are provided by water-soluble      chemicals hydroponic? I can't see much difference between a      hydroponic system using sand as the medium and a dead field      that is irrigated.    </p>    <p>      You could trace hydroponics back to the hanging gardens of      Babylon or to the early experiments by scientists trying to      figure out what chemicals plants need to grow. The word      "hydroponics" was coined in the 1920s when the process was      developed as a re alistic approach to growing plants. It      has been toil ed as the inevitable way the majority of food      will he grown in the future as population growth creates      the need for more food while taking more land out      agricultural production. Hydroponics ("Hydroponic, is both      the singular and plural of the word) potato plants went in      orbit a couple of years ago in a test to see how they would      perform in space.    </p>    <p>      At the Big Pineapple in Australia, after a train ride      through pineapple fields and a trip through macadamia      orchards in a string of nut-shaped truiley cars, the tour      concludes with a boat trip around a hydroponics greenhouse.      At Disney's Epcot you can see plants moving through the air      on conveyors with their dangling roots receiving nutrients      through mists of water being sprayed on them.    </p>    <p>      While someone as grounded in the soil as I am is not      particularly fond of the Disneyland approach to growing,      there are some undeniable facts that fawn gardening without      soil. Plants are fed most efficiently in this manner. They      will also grow faster and are likely to grow larger. This      comparison supposes that soil-grown plants are not living      under optimal growing conditions which, admittedly, is      likely. Most systems control all aspects of the plant's      grower, nutrients, temperature, light, and humidity.    </p>    <p>      Lastly, some will say that soil-less gardening easier,      though I think that is a matter of personal taste. I don't      find anything I do with my soil to work. For me, measuring      and mixing chemicals, lifting and lowering a bucket of      water each day, and cleaning the equipment would seem like      work    </p>    <p>      Nutrients are the key ingredient. Scientists discovered      most of the nutrients necessary for plant growth by      experimenting with growing them in water and adding      chemicals to see what would happen, Now anyone who wants to      grow plants hydroponically can buy properly balanced      chemical solutions from agricultural supply stores and      follow the directions on the label.    </p>    <p>      Is hydroponics the wave of the future? Many thought so      sixty-five years ago. The interaction of the chemicals with      various materials caused some problems. Some of the      materials used as a medium for holding the plants absorbed      nutrients while others released them. The same happened      with containers and piping. Plastic solved a lot of those      problems when it came along and hydroponics saw another      growth spurt. Just this brand of problem-solving has      resulted in the fact-either astonistr ing or thunderingly      unimpressive, I can't decide which-that 2 percent of all      the tomatoes sold in the U.S. are hydroponically grown.    </p>    <p>      Five years or so ago supermarkets in Maine sold lettuce      with the roots in a plastic baggie. It was fun to buy      locally grown lettuce in the winter though it was a bit      expensive. It was also tasty. We don't mind spending more      for a reason. In this case there were two reasons: we were      getting good quality and we were supporting a local grower.      Two years later it disappeared, but our bias against "dead"      agriculture was removed forever. MOTHER first conducted a      taste test of traditional vs. hydroponically grown      vegetables in 1976. and we have never found a significant      flavor difference between the two.    </p>    <p>      But, wait a minute, aren't I dyed-in-the-wool organic?      Aren't hydroponics chemical? Am I advocating a chemical      method of growing food? Yes to all three questions.    </p>    <p>      I grow organically because I like doing it that way. It is      more challenging and more fun for me to get great results      without using chemicals. The icing on the cake is that      there are some who say it can't be done. I love to do      things that "can't be done."    </p>    <p>      I advocate growing organically because chemicals allow some      people who shouldn't be allowed to manage soil at all to      deplete it of organic matter, to poison the soil, air, and      water with agricultural chemicals, and to sell food with      potential poison on them.    </p>    <p>      Hydroponics does not contribute to soil depletion nor does      it spread poisons around indiscriminately. Hydroponically      grown vegetables may have pesticide residues, but because      they are usually grown indoors, most of the insects can be      controlled with barriers. Finally, hydroponics ultimately      uses fewer chemicals and less water than conventional      agriculture does.    </p>    <p>      Nutrient solutions can be made from natural sources by      leaching good compost or manure and collecting the "tea."      If your definition of organic is without manufactured      chemicals," you can have organic hydroponics. In a      head-to-head test of commercial, artificial hydroponic      solutions, and naturally obtained "teas," MOTHER has found      that the commercial solutions caused the plants to grow      slightly faster, but the naturally-fed plants were      significantly less prone to wilt during the hottest part of      the day. We'll take the natural, thanks.    </p>
