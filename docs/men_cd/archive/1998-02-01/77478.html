            				<h2 id="subtitle">      The Eclipsed Season</h2>    <p>		 <strong><em>Both the Sun and      the Moon vanish from the sky this February</em> <em><br />      By Fred Schaaf</em></strong></p><p> If you're getting just plain      sick of winter, perhaps some fine February and March birds      and eclipses can help brighten things up a bit. By making      the heavens, birds, and nature in general an important part      of your life, you'll be following in the footsteps of a      number of the men whose lives we are supposed to      collectively celebrate each February on Presidents' Day.</p><p>      <strong>Snowbirds</strong>    </p>    		<p>February is often the snowiest month in many parts of the    U.S. The swallows may still be many weeks away from    returning; what birds can we look for to cheer us up? There    may be chickadees, titmice, nuthatches, and of course    brilliant cardinals and blue jays at our feeders. But there    are two other kinds of birds which may bolster us against    wintry weather partly by virtue of their own incredible    hardiness in the face of cold and snow. I'm referring to the    "snowbirds": juncoes and snow buntings.</p><p> The juncoes are much    more common across the U.S. The most widespread species of    them was, until a few decades ago, called the slate-colored    junco. Then a decision was made that slate-colored juncoes    and the Oregon junco should really be considered variants of    the same species, the dark-eyed junco. The slate-colored    junco seems rather drab in its plumage: gray head and back    (darker gray in males), white underneath. Thoreau described    them as "leaden skies above, snow below." But there is one    wonderfully distinguishing Surprise when a junco flies off:    the feathers on either edge of the tail flash white. Juncoes    also have pinkish beaks but this is generally a pale color    and not immediately noticed.</p><p> Juncoes spend the winter across    most of the U.S. north of Georgia. It's easy to attract    flocks of them, but they are almost always    ground-feeders-even their nests are hidden on or near    the ground-so leave food for them beneath your feeder.    In New Jersey where I live, they spend almost exactly six    months, typically arriving from the north in mid-October and    leaving for the north in mid-April. Along the Appalachians    and across New England, some juncoes are year-long residents.</p><p>    <em>Photo By Hans Reinhard/Bruce Coleman</em></p>        <p>      Most, however, summer in Canada's far north as the southern      part of Hudson Bay in the east but as far north as the      shores of the Arctic Ocean in western Canada and Alaska.      Many of our warblers and other songbirds that arrive in      spring are inherently tropical or sub-tropical birds and      they look it, with their bright colors. But we should be      equally impressed that the juncoes are natives of the      subArctic and Arctic who come visit us in the U.S. to enjoy      our "mild" weather in winter!</p><p> The juncoes are not nearly as      polar or winter-hardy as the other "snowbird," the snow      bunting. In winter, snow buntings are mottled gray and      rust-color on top-they have a rusty cap-and      white underneath with prominent white wing-patches. In      summer, in their far-north homes, they are almost entirely      white, save for some small striking patches of black left      on the wings and back. Most winters, you won't see snow      buntings in great numbers farther south than about New      England, Chicago, Nebraska, Montana, and the      Washington-British Columbia border. Some years, however,      they may throng south to the Carolinas, Tennessee, Kansas,      Utah, and Oregon. Whereas juncoes prefer to pick seeds out      of shallow snow, snow buntings are adept at feeding on the      seeds of tall grasses and weeds sticking up out of the      snow, even if they have to flutter up to get to the seeds.</p><p>      How far north do snow buntings go to nest in summer? They      are common throughout Alaska, the Northwest Territories,      and the islands in the Arctic Ocean. Snow buntings can      easily withstand temperatures of -40°F. One study      showed that their body temperature falls rapidly when the      air temperature drops to -58°F But in such conditions      they simply burrow under the snow to stay warm.</p>			<h3>A      Great an d a Minor Eclipse</h3>			        <p>      Eclipses tend to come in bunches at certain times in the      year. In 1998, the world gets two eclipses-one of the Sun,      one of the Moon-just a few weeks apart. Some version of      both events can be seen from most of the United States.</p><p> The      first eclipse is solar. Within a narrow band of Earth's      surface which crosses Colombia, Venezuela, and the southern      Caribbean, the eclipse is total. A total eclipse of the Sun      is probably the most awesome natural event which can be pre      dicted long in advance. The final darkness suddenly falls      and bright planets and stars peek out from a deep purple      sky. During the total part of a total eclipse you can      safely stare up and see the black silhouette of the Moon      surrounded with the gently glowing pearly petals and      streamers of the ghostly outer atmosphere of the sun, the      "corona." At the start or end of a total eclipse, a speck      of the Sun's surface may shine through a deep valley on the      edge of the Moon, sparkling like a star of peerless      brilliance on the still-visible circle of the solar      corona-the "diamond ring:"</p><p> A total solar eclipse only      occurs at a given spot on Earth-say, your      home-an average of about once every 360 years. So      it's very likely you'll have to travel if you ever want to      see one. The February 26 one occurs in the southern      Caribbean-including islands like Aruba, Guadeloupe, and      Antigua; forget Montserrat unless you want to risk      experiencing a deadly volcanic eruption! A cruise or island      vacation in the southern Caribbean in late winter: who      wouldn't want that? Unfortunately, by the time you read      this it may be very difficult to get a booking. You may      just have to aim for the eclipse of August 11,      1999-that one crosses a corner of England, passes      near Paris, and goes right over Munich, Germany. It will be      many years after that before another total solar eclipse is      visible from anywhere either very convenient or very      popular to most American tourists.</p><p> For some of us left at      home this February 26, there is at least the consolation of      a partial solar eclipse. At least a tiny piece of the Sun      is hidden if you live anywhere in the U.S. south or east of      a line that runs from San Diego to Chicago. The question,      of course, is: how can you observe this eclipse safely?</p><p>      NEVER look at a partial solar eclipse directly, either with      the naked eye, binoculars, or telescope. The retina of the      eye has no pain sensors and before you know it you can      permanently blind yourself. There are filters that are      safe, but I'd recommend only one for unsupervised      beginners: shade #14 welder's glass. You can buy a big      enough piece of this to look through from a welding supply      company for just a few dollars.    </p>        <p>The easiest and safest way for a beginner to see a    partial solar eclipse is by "projection." Place the Sun    behind you and adjust the tube or tubes of your telescope or    binoculars until they cast the smallest, roundest shadow    possible. Then hold or place a piece of cardboard in front of    the eyepiece(s), making sure never to look through the    eyepiece. You can even burn your hand at the proper focus    point of heat, so be careful! What you'll see on your screen    is an image of the Sun with a bite out of it. The bite is the    Moon moving in front of it! You can sharpen the image by    moving the screen a little closer or farther from the    eyepiece. A telescope may be sharp enough to enable you to    see some sunspots on the screen.</p><p> You can even project a tiny    image of the Sun with a piece of cardboard with a pinhole in    it. If you want more information about observing solar    eclipses and the local times when this one occurs, check out    the February issue of Sky e'r Telescope magazine. You'll also    learn there about the very minor eclipse which takes place on    the evening of March 12. All the lower forty-eight states get    to see this "penumbral" eclipse of the Moon. The slight    shadowing on the Moon's lower right edge will be best visible    around 11:20 P.M. EST, 10:20 P.M. CST, and so on.</p>		<h3>Presidents and Nature</h3>        <p>      You're not the only one who enjoys watching birds or      eclipses. Presidents' Day is good to think about some of      our great leaders who, in their day, were amateur birders,      astronomers, or meteorologists themselves. Both George      Washington and Thomas Jefferson took daily weather      readings, including temperature, for most of their      lives-Washington right up until the day he died. Jefferson      recorded a temperature of 76°F in Philadelphia on the      afternoon of July 4, 1776. Jefferson also had a tremendous      interest in astronomy. He was only following the general      consensus of astronomers of his day when in December 1807      he refused to believe that the more than 300 pounds of      meteorites that fell in Weston, Connecticut could have come      from outer space. Lincoln's Sparrow, surprisingly, is named      not for Abraham Lincoln, but for bird artist John James      Audubon's friend Thomas Lincoln. Laura Erickson also points      out in her wonderful book For the Birds-An Uncommon      Guide that Theodore Roosevelt may have been the last person      to see a passenger pigeon alive in the wild and that      Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a lifelong member of the      American Ornithologists' Union.    </p>    <h3>ALMANAC <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> ALMANAC for Feb-Mar      1998</h3>    <p>      <strong>FEBRUARY 1998</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>1</strong>            Saturn just to right of the Moon at dusk.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2</strong>            Groundhog Day; Candlemas (Feast of the Purification of      Mary).    </p>    <p>      <strong>3</strong>            FIRST QUARTER MOON, 5:53 P.M.
