            		<p>      <strong>MOTHERS INTERVIEW</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Vicki Robin speaks with Betsey Model on the principles      of frugality</em>    </p>        <p>      As we type this story, the high-pitched and strained voices      of newsmen and women on the radio are beginning to betray a      less than journalistic anxiety in the wake of a panic      selling session on Wall Street. The market has plummeted      five hundred points in a single day and the paper mansions      and yachts built in the bull market of the past year are      blowing in the wind.    </p>    <p>      After the financial boom and bust of the '80s, the      catch-phrase on many a Mercedes bumper-sticker was "The One      Who Dies With the Most Toys Wins." It's incongruous that,      just a few years later, one of the fastest selling how-to      books on the New York Times bestseller list was not about      how to get ahead, get more money, get a job, or get an      image. It was about how to get by on less ...less spending,      less negative environmental impact, and less dependence on      the government or corporate America for financial security.    </p>    <p>      In 1992, former Wall Street financial analyst Joe Dominguez      and his partner, Vicki Robin, published Your Money or Your      Life, a national bestseller that addressed the question "Is      this all there is?" Through a nine-step program, Dominguez      and Robin showed readers how to live well on less, get out      of debt and, most importantly, develop savings. Now      published in four languages and distributed around the      world, the book-and its authors-are often      credited with kicking off the "voluntary simplicity"      movement. Robin, with her late partner Joe Dominguez,      formed the Seattle-based nonprofit New Road Map Foundation,      traveled the country on speaking engagements, and made over      400 media appearances encouraging consumers to stop      consuming. Her philosophy is one many MOTHER readers have      embraced most of their lives. But many more write us each      month asking for concrete advice on how to make their lives      simpler and more fulfilling. Robin's work has been to take      these principles out of some idealistic realm of abstract      thinking and teach people step-by-step how to move away      from a consumer existence.    </p>    <p>      Attractive, articulate, and neatly dressed, Robin, 52,      looks and sounds more like a $50,000 executive recruiter      than the woman once dubbed the "prophet of      consumption-downsizers" by the New York Times. She's a      dynamic speaker and a persuasive voice on the subject of      consumerism's impact on our quality of life and the life of      our planet. A cum laude graduate of Brown University, Ms.      Robin is a member of the Task Force on Population and      Consumption on the President's Council on Sustainable      Development, a founding member and Trustee of Sustainable      Seattle, and author of a series of booklets including "All      Consuming Passion: Waking Up From the American Dream" and      "How Earth Friendly Are You? A Lifestyle Assessment      Questionnaire."    </p>    <p>      Betsy Model for <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>: What exactly is the New      Road Map Foundation?    </p>    <p>      <strong>VICKI ROBIN:</strong> It's an all-volunteer,      non-profit, educational and charitable foundation where we      teach people tools for shifting to low-consumption,      high-fulfillment lifestyles. None of the people who work at      New Road Map are paid. All of our proceeds from seminars or      books or educational programs are donated to non-profit      groups working toward a sustainable world. We're about      frugality and about how to learn to save without doing      without much of what truly makes you happy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Trends Research Institute, a source      used by businesses, government and educators to track      trends and habits, called "Voluntary Simplicity" one of the      ten fastest growing trends in America. In fact, they said      "never before in the Institute's seventeen years of trend      tracking has a societal trend grown so quickly, spread so      broadly, and been embraced so eagerly." Do you agree?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I'm hopeful! I think there's a new      segment of the American public asking themselves "is this      all there is?" and not liking the answer. As a nation, as      consumers, we spend too much-way too much-and      aren't any happier or richer in health or in our family      lives... but I think people are catching on. I think people      are looking for a better way, a way to feel better about      the hours they spend away from home working, about the time      they spend with their families and they are beginning to      realize that if they want security financially, it's going      to have to come directly from them, not from an outside      source or the government. I think the most exciting thing      is that people are realizing that spending less, saving      more, and redirecting their energies and personal resources      doesn't mean they're losing out. Frugality is not about      doing without. It's not about a loss of beauty or grace or      about not having those things in your life. It's about      living well on less and by living within your means. And      living within our means isn't just about money but about      our natural resources and our planet's resources.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> In spite of asking people to go to      their libraries and borrow it, more than 400,000 copies of      Your Money or Your Life have sold and now it's taking off      in Europe and elsewhere. The book is five years old ...how      do you explain its continuing popularity?    </p>    <h3>RECLAIMING YOUR LIFE:<br />A      NINE-STEP PLAN</h3>    <p>      Step 1: Making Peace with the Past<br />      <strong>A:</strong> <strong>How much have you earned in      your life?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Social Security Administration-Request for Statement      of Earnings. Copies of federal or state income tax returns.      Paycheck stubs; employers' records.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gives a clear picture of how powerful you are in bringing      money into your life. Eliminates vagueness in this arena.      Instills confidence, facilitates goal-setting. This is a      very basic, fundamental practice for any business-and you      are a business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>B: What have you got to show for it?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      List a current market value to everything you own. List      everything you owe. Deduct liabilities from assets to get      net worth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      You can never know what is enough if you don't know what      you have. You might find that you have a lot of material      possessions that are not bringing you fulfillment, and you      might want to convert them to cash. This is a very basic,      fundamental practice for any business-and you are a      business.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 2:</strong> <strong>Being in the      Present-Tracking Your life Energy</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> How much are you trading your life      energy for? Establish the actual costs in time and money      required to maintain your job, and compute your real hourly      wage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Deduct from your gross weekly income the costs of commuting      and job costuming; the extra cost of at-work meals; amounts      spent for decompressing, recreating, escaping, and      vacationing from work stress; job-related illness; and all      other expenses associated with maintaining yourself on the      job. Add to your work-week the hours spent in preparing      yourself for work, commuting, decom pressing, recreating,      escaping, vacationing, shopping to make you feel better      since your job feels lousy, and all other hours that are      linked to maintaining your job. Divide the new, reduced      weekly dollar figure by the new, increased weekly hour      figure; this is your real hourly wage. Individuals with      variable incomes can get creative-take monthly averages, a      typical week, whatever works for you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a very basic business practice. You are in the      business of selling the most precious resource in      existence: your life energy. You had better know what you      are selling it for. The number that results from this      step-your real hourly wage-will become a vital ingredient      in transforming your relationship with money.    </p>    <p>      <strong>B. Keep track of every cent that comes into or goes      out of your life.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Devise a record-keeping system that works for you (such as      a pocket-sized memo book). Record daily expenditures      accurately. Record all of your income.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is a very basic, fundamental practice for any      business. You are in the business of trading the most      precious resource in existence your life energy. This      record book shows in detail what you are trading it for.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 3:</strong> <strong>Where Is it All      Going?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Every month create a table of all income and all expenses      within categories generated by your own unique spending      pattern. Balance your monthly income and monthly outgo      totals. Convert "dollars" spent in each category to "hours      of life energy," using your real hourly wage as computed in      Step 2.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      This Monthly Tabulation will be an accurate portrait of how      you are actually living. This Monthly Tabulation will      provide a foundation for the rest of this program.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 4:</strong> <strong>Three Questions that Will      Transform Your Life</strong>    </p>    <p>      On your Monthly Tabulation, ask these three questions of      each of your category totals-expressed as hours of      life energy-and record your responses:    </p>    <p>      1. Did I receive fulfillment, satisfaction, and value in      proportion to life energy spent?    </p>    <p>      2. Is this expenditure of life energy in alignment with my      values and life purpose?    </p>    <p>      3. How might this expenditure change if I didn't have to      work for a living?    </p>    <p>      At the bottom of each category, make one of the following      marks:    </p>    <p>      Mark a minus (-) sign (or a down arrow) if you did not      receive fulfillment proportional to the hours of life      energy you spent in acquiring the goods and services in      that category, or if that expenditure was not in full      alignment with your values and purpose or if you could see      expenses in that category diminishing after Financial      Independence.    </p>    <p>      Mark a plus (+) sign (or an up arrow) if you be lieve that      upping this expenditure would in, - crease fulfillment,      would demonstrate greater personal alignment, or would      increase after Financial Independence. Mark a (0) if that      cate gory is just fine on all counts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      With total honesty.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is the core of the program. These questions will      clarify and integrate your earning, spending, values,      purpose, sense of fulfillment, and your integrity. This      will help you discover what is enough.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 5:</strong> <strong>Making Life Energy      Visible</strong>    </p>    <p>      Create a large Wall Chart plotting the total monthly income      and total monthly expenses from your Monthly Tabulation.      Put it where you will see it every day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Get a large sheet of graph paper, 18 by 22 inches to 24 by      36 inches with 10 squares to the centimeter or 10 squares      to the inch Choose a scale that allows plenty of room above      your highest projected monthly expenses or monthly income.      Use different-colored lines for monthly expenses and      monthly income.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      It will show you the trend in your financial situation and      will give you a sense of progress over time, and the      transformation of your relationship with money will be      obvious. You will see your expense line go down as your      fulfillment goes up-the result of "instinctive,"      automatic lowering of expenses in those categories you      labeled with a minus. This Wall Chart will become the      picture of your progress toward full Financial      Independence, and you will use it for the rest of the      program. It will provide inspiration, stimulus, support,      and gentle chiding.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 6:</strong> <strong>Valuing Your Life      Energy-Minimizing Spending</strong>    </p>    <p>      Learn and practice intelligent use of your life energy      (money), which will result in lowering your expenses and      increasing your savings. This will create greater      fulfillment, integrity, and alignment in your life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ask yourself the three questions in Step 4 every month.      Learn to define your true needs. Be conscious in your      spending. Master the techniques of wise purchasing Research      value quality, and durability.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      You are spending your most precious commodity-your      life energy. You have only a finite amount left. You are      consuming the planet's precious resources-there is      only a finite amount left. You cannot expect your      children-or your government-to "know the value of a      buck" if you don't demonstrate it. "Quality of life" often      goes down as "standard of living" goes up. There is a peak      to the Fulfillment Curve-spending more after you've      reached the peak will bring less fulfillment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 7:</strong> <strong>Valuing Your Life      Energy-Maximizing Income</strong>    </p>    <p>      Respect the life energy you are putting into your job.      Money is simply something you trade your life energy for.      Trade it with purpose and integrity for increased earnings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Ask yourself: Am I making a living, or dying? Examine your      purposes for paid employment. Break the link between work      and wages.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      You have only X number of hours left in your life.      Determine how you want to spend those remaining hours.      Breaking the robotic link between who you are and what you      do for a "living" will free you to make more fulfilling      choices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 8:</strong> <strong>Capital and the Crossover      Point</strong>    </p>    <p>      Each month apply the following equation to your total      accumulated capital, and post the monthly independence in      come as a separate line on your Wall Chart:    </p>    <p>      capital x current long-term interest rate                  Monthly investment    </p>    <p>                                 12 months                                                			income    </p>    <p>      <br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Find the long-term interest rate by looking at the interest      of the thirty-year treasury bonds in the treasury bond      table of the Wall Street Journal or a big-city newspaper.      After a number of months on the program, your total monthly      expense line will have established a smaller zigzag pattern      at a much lower level than when you started. With a light      pencil line, project the total monthly expense line into      the future. After a number of months on the program, your      monthly investment income line will have begun to move up      from the lower edge of the chart. (If you have actually      been investing this money as outlined in Step 9, the line      will be curving upward-the result of the magic of compound      interest.) With a light pencil line, project the monthly      investment income curve into the future. At some point in      the future it will cross over the total monthly expenses      line. That is the Crossover Point. You will gain      inspiration and momentum when you can see that you need to      work for pay for only a finite period of time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHY:</strong>    </p>    <p>      At the Crossover Point you will be financially independent.      The monthly income from your invested capital will be equal      to your actual monthly expenses. You will have enough. Your      options are now wide open.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 9: Managing Your Finances</strong>    </p>    <p>      The final step to financial independence: become      knowledgeable and sophisticated about long-term      income-producing investments. Invest your capital in such a      way as to provide an absolutely safe income, sufficient to      meet your basic needs for the rest of your life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Empower yourself to make your own investment decisions by      narrowing the focus to the safest, nonspeculative,      long-duration fixed-income securities, such as U.S.      treasury bonds and U.S. government agency bonds. Temper the      prevailing irrational fears about inflation with clear      thinking and increased awareness. Cut out the high      expenses, fees, and commissions of middlemen and popularly      marketed investment "products." Set up a financial plan      using three pillars: Capital: The income-producing core of      your Financial Independence. Cushion: Enough ready cash,      earning bank interest, to cover six months of expenses.      Cache: The surplus of funds resulting from your continued      practice of the nine steps. May be used to finance your      service work, reinvested to produce an endowment fund, used      to replace high cost items, used to compensate for      occasional inroads of inflation, given away, etc.    </p>    <p>      Adapted from Your Money or Your Life (Penguin Books, 1992)      by Joe Dominguez and Vicki Robin. Copyright © Vicki      Robin and Joe Dominguez, 1992.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I think partly it's because my late      partner, Joe Dominguez, and I proved to be living, walking      proof that living on less, much less, can be done      successfully. We each managed on less than $6,000 per year      (well below the federal poverty level) and we lived well. I      live in a nice home, in a nice neighborhood and, I think, I      dress nicely. I live within my means. I take care of what I      have. I use something until it wears out and then I replace      it with something used or something I've found for less      money.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SINCE 1840, AMERICANS alone have used up as large a      share of the earth's mineral resources as all previous      generations combined.</strong>    </p>    <p>      That's the message to the people reading Your Money or Your      Life or who are participating in group workshops or      workplace seminars. That and save, save, save. You're      responsible for you and for the security you want to feel.      You're responsible for consuming less energy and less      natural resources. You're responsible for spending more      time with your family or in community service or in      whatever makes more sense for you than spending it in line      buying something you probably don't need but which an      advertising executive somewhere has convinced you to buy.      Partly because the workplace plays such a big role in most      people's lives-as a means of income, as somewhere they      spend large amounts of time and energy, as a place that      consumes a lot of resources-the New Road Map      Foundation has begun teaching the frugality seminars to      those companies who want to spread the word and maybe want      to change their own spending habits. We've taught the      course at larger companies like Weyerhaeuser and at smaller      ones, including, interestingly enough, a recent one at a      firm specializing in corporate job outplacement.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> How do you feel about the term      "voluntary simplicity?"    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I think it's become a popular      phrase ...one that consumers have caught on to. I      personally like the term "downshifting:" I think that the      term "voluntary simplicity" is fine but there's a bigger      picture. . .voluntary simplicity is beautiful, but I see it      as an ethic, a great personal ethic. The larger picture is      when you bring into focus our impact on the earth and the      environment by our everyday consumption habits. When they      published Your Money or Your Life in Spain, they referred      to it as a book about this movement in North America      towards downshifting. I'm really comfortable with that      term. Some wonderful people doing great things and waking      the public up-people like Duane Elgin who wrote Voluntary      Simplicity and Cecile Andrews who authored The Circle of      Simplicity have brought the phrase "voluntary simplicity"      to the average consumer and that's terrific. I'm not overly      concerned with what people call it as long as they practice      it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> You mentioned earlier that the      statistics scare you. . .which statistics and why?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> Oh gosh, it's hard to know where to      begin! There's been a rise in per capita consumption in the      United States of 45 percent during the last 20 years. This      is at a time when nearly half of all Americans have less      than $10,000 saved for retirement. While almost 70 percent      said they could save money, only 20 percent thought they      would likely do so. The savings crisis that Joe had seen      coming for years is here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Tell us more.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> It's so obvious that people aren't      any happier when they're saving less and spending more than      when they're practicing the opposite ...people today are on      average 4.5 times richer than their great grandparents, yet      they report feeling less well-off. During the boom of the      1980s, there was an increase in consumer debt of 140      percent. In 1992, the year that we wrote Your Money or Your      Life, there were some 900,000 individuals filing for      bankruptcy, triple that of just ten years earlier.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> One of the primary cornerstones of      Your Money or Your Life is the need for consumers to save.      Why do you think that that's so hard for such a large      portion of the American public?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> We have come to believe, deeply,      that it is our right to consume. If we have the money, we      can buy whatever we want, whether or not we need it, use      it, or even enjoy it. After all, it's a free country. And      if we don't have the money ...heck, what are credit cards      for? Beyond the constitutional rights of free speech,      assembly, due process and so on, there is the right to have      anything you want, as long as your are willing to pay for      it ...or at least promise to pay for it on time. The value      of assets or savings that today's average 50-year-old has      set aside for retirement is $2,300. We're a generation that      in many respects was never taught how to save, only how to      spend. Many people think Social Security or a company      pension will take care of them. Or people that own a house      think that real estate will always appreciate or that their      kids will take care of them. Of course, these are myths. As      self-aware and self-responsible humans, we can leave these      old myths behind. The American character has faced tougher      work than this. When science showed us the danger of being      couch potatoes, of smoking, of eating too much fat, we      responded with lifestyle changes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> Do you think that people who have      been reading your book and watching the newspaper articles      and television shows on voluntary simplicity will suddenly      throw up their hands and want to move to the country?      Should we expect an invasion?    </p>    <p>      <strong>WE'RE A GENERATION that was never taught how to      save, only how to spend. We have come to believe, deeply,      that it is our right to consume.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I really don't know. Certainly      there are so many transformations going on in the workplace      with regard to things like telecommuting that there are      opportunities for both corporations and for corporate      employees to move to more rural areas. But that alone won't      suddenly provide a dramatic shift in consumer buying or in      downshifting. It's not unusual for people to "go to the      city" to earn their dol lars, then "go back to the land" to      enjoy a quieter lifestyle. But that quieter, more      self-sustaining lifestyle can be achieved anywhere,      including the bigger cities. Surprisingly, New York City is      an amazingly self-sustaining city. Apartment dwellers share      walls, thereby sharing and conserving heat and energy. Just      about everything is within walking distance grocery, day      care, bank, florist, whatever you might need-and there is      terrific public transportation. Of course, there's also a      huge benefit to the countryside, including a better      opportunity to grow gardens and practice livestock      management.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEN:</strong> If reports like the one from Trends      Research are accurate, saying that by the year 2005, at      least 15 percent of the developed world will be practicing      voluntary simplicity in some form (up from less than 2      percent today), what impact will that have on Mother Earth      News readers, many of whom have been practicing "voluntary      simplicity" for more than 20 years?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ROBIN:</strong> I think one of the single biggest      impacts will be an affirmation of what your readers have      been doing: practicing the principles of frugality. In this      country, people haven't been rewarded for thrift, they're      been ridiculed! They're called tightwads or cheapskates. If      you drive an older car like I do, you're seen as quirky or      "quaint." I'm not quaint, I'm frugal.    </p>    <p>      America is full of people who've been living a downsized      lifestyle for years, they're just not written up in      newspapers or asked for interviews. I'm only a voice for      those people. I believe it's time for those pioneers to be      seen as leaders and to recognize themselves as [such].    </p>    <p>      It's no longer a negative thing but a positive lesson to      answer a compliment on how you're dressed with "Thank you,      I got it at the thrift store." I believe that soon, an      increasing number of consumers will come for advice to      those who have already learned the basics of downsizing, of      saving, and of getting by just as well on less.    </p>    <p>      And it's about time.    </p>    <p>      If you would like to receive more information on the New      Road Map Foundation, you may write to them at PO.
