                <p>      <strong>ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Is President Clinton's Million Solar Rooftops"      initiative just a pipe dream or the equivalent of JFK's      "Call to Space"?-By Jhon Schaeffer</em>    </p>        <p>      They say the darkest hour is just before dawn. Ever since      solar electric technologies were developed in the 1950s, as      a means of powering up the space program, the industry has      been alternately hailed as the only viable solution for      energy independence, and lamented as the unworkable pipe      dream of a handful of environmental idealists. With the      disappointing performance and subsequent disappearance of      80s era tax rebates for solarization, and an increase in      the availability of cheap fossil fuels from foreign      markets, the future of solar electric has made those of us      who five to perpetuate it at once hopeful and daunted. The      imminent deregulation of utility providers, aggressive new      government incentives, and President Clinton's ambitious      initiative to bring one million solar electric energy      systems to American rooftops by 2010 has dramatically      altered the global future of renewable energy, however.    </p>    <p>      While government and utility industry nay-sayers have been      moaning about the impracticality of producing, delivering,      and metering solar electric energy, it has been left to      relatively small companies to perfect the technology that      makes home-based solar electric generation not only      practical, but cost-competitive with utility generated      electricity. As utility deregulation becomes a reality,      beginning early in 1998, consumers will-for the first      time in history-be able to put their utility dollars      where their convictions are.    </p>    <p>      On January 1, 1998, California led the way down the road to      energy independence by fully embracing utility deregulation      years before the rest of the nation. This is not surprising      considering the exorbitant rates California residents have      been shelling out for their power. Despite the promises of      cheap electricity mouthed by utility company executives      attempting to justify their nuclear boondoggles, California      rates have historically been among the highest in the      country. Essentially, deregulation means that, once Big      Power has been dissected into a number of Little Power      Lines, consumers should be able to sort through the      rhetoric and choose not only the price per kilowatt, but      the source of the electrons zooming into their stereo      systems.    </p>        <p>      For those whose only consideration is the bottom line,      there will undoubtedly be cheap coal-fired and      nuclear-generated power, priced to keep consumers on the      fossil fuel grid. Fortunately for the planet, there are      dozens of renewable energy based players gearing up to      deliver the same reliable power, but generated by solar,      wind, biomass, geothermal and small scale hydro      technologies. What constitutes truly renewable,      sustainable, or "green" electricity is still a subject of      avid debate, with partisans lining up behind their personal      pick. The good news is that consumers will be able do the      same thing: investigate the pros and cons of various      electricity-generation methods, make an informed decision,      and switch to the source of their choice. On the one hand,      you won't have to let the governing body of your local      power company choose for you anymore. On the other hand,      the responsibility for choosing wisely will rest squarely      on the individual consumer.    </p>    <p>      With all our optimism, even deregulation is just a glimmer      of the coming dawn of our new solar era. While deregulation      promises lower rates, it virtually guarantees that power      consumers will be bombarded with competing claims and      confusion. Everyone remembers how telephone service started      sliding down the slippery slope after deregulation;      business analysts and consumers alike agree that the      quality of phone service today leaves much to be desired      compared to the pre-regulation era. Will the same thing      happen to utility delivery after deregulation? It might.      All the more reason to beat the fossil fuel industry by      taking advantage of the incredible new incentives for      generating your power at home.    </p>    <p>      It's hard to believe, but the U.S. government actually      learned something from the ill-fated rebate programs it      staged in the 80s Brave new incentives are now offered      directly to manufacturers, giving consumers the benefit of      lower prices without reams of paperwork, initial cash      outlay, or waiting for a rebate check. Similar to programs      deployed effectively in Japan and Germany, the Federal      "Team Up" incentives subsidize the maker's cost of      producing utility-connected residential photovoltaic      systems, rather than rebating the user's purchase price.      Similar state sponsored subsidy programs currently in the      works will allow even more savings, varying by state. In      bottom line terms, the result is an incredible, hassle-free      40% to 70% reduction of the consumer cost of installing a      solar-electric system.    </p>    <p>      As an example, the typical household uses about 700 kwh of      utility-generated electricity monthly. Setting aside the      issue of reducing power consumption through conservation      and energy-saving technology the consumer would need to      install a five kilowatt photovoltaic system to meet      existing needs. At pre-incentive prices, we're talking      about a cost of $10 per watt or more, or about $50,000.      After Federal subsidies (about 40%) and projected state      subsidies (about 30%), the post-incentive cost for the same      system could drop as low as $3 per watt, or $15,000.      According to Vincent Schwent of the California Energy      Commission "Solar systems installed at $3 per watt are      competitive with current utility company prices." We don't      need Vince to tell us that $15,000 sounds a whole lot      better than $50,000.    </p>    <p>      The really exciting part of this whole program is that the      bulk of the subsidies are being used for the manufacture of      utility-connected solar electric systems, also known as      "utility intertie" systems. This is the technology that      makes home-generated solar the cleanest, most viable power      source on the market. The concept is simple but beautiful.      During the day, power from your rooftop PV array is routed      into the utility breaker box for home use. What? You mean      you use most of your power at night when you're actually      home? No problem. All day long, when your empty house's      power needs are minimal, excess home-generated power is      sold back to the utility company and your meter runs      backward. At night, when your usage peaks, the utility      sells power back to you. California, and 14 other states as      of this writing, already have net metering laws on the      books to ensure that the power traded back and forth      between your rooftop and the local utility company is sold      at exactly the same price. In some locations, particularly      the sunny Southwest, homeowners may even get a check from      their power company at the end of the month, instead of a      bill.    </p>    <p>      So what's the catch? Initial incentive programs are limited      in scope due to a finite amount of government dollars      available. They will be allocated on a first-come,      first-served basis, and will be monitored by numerous      agencies over the life of the system. It has been estimated      that if only 10% of the nationwide population chooses      electricity produced by renewable energy sources by buying      from clean and green power companies spawned by      deregulation, there will be a net increase of 30% in      available renewable energy sources. That figure doesn't      even include the increased demand created by consumers who      install their own heavily subsidized utility intertie      systems. The basic laws of supply and demand dictate that      the cost of manufacturing solar systems will decrease as      the volume of sales increase.    </p>    <p>      Real Goods, in conjunction with Astropower, the second      largest manufacturer of PV systems in the country, and      Trace Engineering, the leading power conditioning      manufacturer, will be providing up to 25 of these heavily      discounted solar electric power systems in the San      Francisco Bay Area in the first quarter of 1998. Although      we recognize that 25 systems is a drop in the energy      bucket, the value of this pilot program is that it      demonstrates that utility intertie systems will satisfy the      needs of the average energy consumer, without draconian      austerity measures to reduce consumption. After all, our      voracious power appetite, as well as a national      unwillingness to make substantial changes in consumption      patterns, has been the biggest drawback of stand-alone      solar systems for years. Collectively, we aren't going to      give up our electric toothbrushes without a fight. The new      utility intertie systems allow a consistent delivery of      enough electricity to satisfy existing usage habits, by      making possible a seamless transition front      rooftop-generated electricity to utility-generated      electricity. By combining a utility intertie solar electric      system, made costeffective by government subsidies, with      your choice of a green utility provider, made possible by      utility deregulation, you could conceivably never use a      single electron generated by fossil fuels.    </p>    <p>      The intention of the Team Up subsidy program is to provide      a launching pad for clean sources of power; the incentives      will taper off over five years, at which point these      technologies should be able to stand alone and compete in      the open market. The California state incentives are not      limited strictly to solar electric generation, by the way.      Utility ratepayers in the state will he contributing $540      million over the neat three years to provide incentives for      existing, new, and emerging green technologies. While      largely earmarked for existing renewable technologies like      utility scaled wind farms and hydro-electric, there are      numerous proposals for more exotic technologies on the      horizon.    </p>    <p>      Nor No discussion of a solar future is complete without a      cursory glance at Clinton's Million Rooftops Initiative.      The idea is to install 20,000 solar-electric systems can      Federal buildings by 2010. How does this help the average      consumer? Again, the increased manufacturing demand can't      help but bring prices down. Further, the Initiative has the      potential to create as many as 70,000 new high-tech jobs.      Although details remain to be worked out, we could see      federal grants to further reduce system costs to the      consumer, as well as low interest loans to solar-electric      pioneers.    </p>    <p>      Is it possible that the dawn of a new solar era will put      fossil fuels to rest at last? Yes it is. A heightened      mainstream awareness of the perils of resource depletion      and global warming is finally waking up the powers that be,      and energy independence is at last becoming a technological      reality. Developing nations, many of which are eager to      follow the U.S. pattern of unbridled power consumption and      the lifestyle it permits, are taking a closer look at      renewable energy systems. With an unprecedented level of      government support for renewable energy manufacturers as      demonstrated by the new subsidy programs and imminent      deregulation our nation is in the unique position to prove      that solar energy, and energy efficient technologies in      general, are the cornerstone of our sustainability as a      species. With the ball firmly in the consumer's court, the      last remaining question is whether or not we'll run with it      or just let it lie.    </p>    <p>      In the coming months, MOTHER plans to report on exciting      developments in the renewable energy industry that will      revolutionize the way power is provided and consumed in      America and worldwide.
