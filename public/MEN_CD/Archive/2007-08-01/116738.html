        <p>I’ve been gardening organically for many years in our Zone 6b region. I note that people are always asking and writing about getting rid of slugs. The general response is beer, copper, diatomaceous earth, bait and traps.</p><p>I’ve been practicing a method with eggshells and have found it to be 100 percent effective. My chickens provide me with the best eggs ever and after using the eggs, I rinse out the shells, let them dry and store them in a coffee can. After the can is full, I put them in an old food processor and grind them up. I sprinkle them around my flowers, veggies, etc. Slugs will not crawl across them. Also, the eggshells provide the mineral benefit of calcium for my garden!</p><p>I realize that some people compost or crush eggshells by hand, but with the food processor, they’re quite manageable and don’t nick and cut your hands. Also, it makes it easier to distribute the shells around plants.</p><hr />
