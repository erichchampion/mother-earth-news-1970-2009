                <p>      With a little ingenuity, you can put pedals to work in your      wood shop:    </p>      			  <p>      In our last issue (see No. 68, page 134), we described how      to generate DC electricity by connecting the basic cycle      power chassis, as featured in MOTHER NO. 67, to an      automobile alternator. (See page 116 to order back issues.)      This time around, we're going to show you how to build a      jim-dandy combination disk-sander/reciprocating-saw that      fits the pedaled powerplant like a glove.    </p>        <h3>SCROUNGED FROM SCRAP</h3>				    <p>      The backbone of our "treadle" tool is a worn-out upright      lawnmower engine, the likes of which are available in just      about any junkyard. If the unit you locate has belt drive,      fine ... if not, you'll have to remove the chain sprocket      and simply install a pulley that's compatible with the      motor shaft.    </p>    <p>      Then take off your engine's cylinder head, carburetor,      muffler, flywheel housing, and any other components that      aren't part of the "working" block. Next, drill a 1/2"      centered hole in the top of the piston and tap it to accept      1/4" pipe .. . before threading a 1/4" to 5/16" ball      compression fitting into the tapped hole and snugging it      down firmly.    </p>    <p>      Once that's done, take a 3/8" bolt and grind the threads      from the last 3/8" of it to form a taper, then grip the      fastener-end upin a vise, and hacksaw a vertical      split down the center of the just-formed, coneshaped      nub. Finally, cut the two "half rounds" from the rest of      the bolt . . . these will function as the tapered split      pins that will hold your saber saw blade in place.    </p>    <p>      Secure the reciprocating cutter by setting its mounting      bayonet into the socket of the compression fitting and      slipping the split cones-tapers down-into the semicircular      openings on either side of the metal "tongue". You can then      slide the nut over the blade and lock it tightly onto the      fitting.    </p>    <p>      To make a flush cutting table, take a piece of 3/4" X 12" X      15" plywood and, with a 2-1/2" We raw, drill a centered      opening 5 inches from one long edge. of the board. Now,      using the discarded cylinder head-and its mounting      bores-as a template, mark and drill four 5/16" holes      into the platform, at points evenly surrounding the      aperture, and countersink them 5/16 inch with a 5/8" bit.      Next, take the 1/8" X 6" metal disk and drill a 1/2"      opening at its central point . . . then align this hole      over the 2-1/2" port in the wooden table, and trace the      plate's circumference with a pencil. Finally, using the      justdrawn line as a border, rout out all the wood within      the circle to a depth of 1/8 inch, and use the original      head bolts to fasten the plank to the top of the engine      block. (To assure that the compression fitting won't strike      the metal plate at the top of its upward stroke, place the      piston in exactly that position, and then slip washers or      nuts under the plywood platform to raise it slightly.) Now      fasten the cover disk into its recess in the table with a      pair of No. 6 X 1/2" flathead wood screws . . . after first      countersinking the holes in the plate to keep the screw      heads flush with the upper surface.    </p>       <h3>IT'S A SANDER, TOO!</h3>			  <p>      The other half of our tool is a disk sander, and you can      easily attach this implement on the flywheel of your      recycled "one lunger". To do so, lay the rotating      counterweight flat on your work surface, then take the 3/4"      X 8" circular plywood blank, center it over the flywheel,      and drill three evenly spaced 1/4" holes through both      components. Now countersink the bores slightly with a 1/2"      bit, and cut a 1 "-diameter hole through the center of the      wooden circle.    </p>		    <p>      Next, secure the disk to the flywheel with three 1/4" X      1-1/2" bolts, and reinstall the counterweight on the      crankshaft. The sandpaper can then be glued to a metal      plate, which is-in turn-fastened to the plywood by means of      three countersunk No. 6 X 1/2" flathead wood screws placed      near the outer border of the metal circle. (You might also      take this opportunity to wrap some duct tape around the      flywheel to cover any sharp edges.)    </p>    <p>      At this point, mount the engine block on its 3/4" X 10" X      20" wooden base. Of course, since it's best if both the      drive pulley and the sander extend beyond the platform      slightlyso the stand won't inter fere with the belt or with      your ability to smooth an oddly shaped piece of workyou      might want to trim down the foundation's width accordingly.      In any case, position the mechanism on the board, drill      four 5/16" mounting holes in line with those already in the      block's base, and install four 5/16" X 2" bolts to hold the      engine in place.    </p>    <p>      With this accomplished, you can knock together a little      sanding platform. Take your 3/4" X 3-1/4" X 13" board and      remove a 1 " X 8-1/2" notch from the center of one of its      sides. Then cut out a 3/16" X 3/4" X 3-1/4" groove-centered      2 inches from each endfrom one "face" of the board . . .      place one of your 3/4" X 3-1/4" X 5-3/4" support pieces      against one end of the sanding platform . . . and, with the      miniature table held perpendicularly against the sanding      wheel, scribe a line to indicate the angle to which you'll      need to cut the support. Duplicate this angle at a spot      4-1/2 inches below the initial line, then mark a      perpendicular from a point 1-1/4" behind the leading edge      of the support to its base. Make your cuts on these lines,      then trace the pattern on the second piece of wood and make      similar cuts.    </p>    <p>      To secure the assembly to the mounting platform, simply      fasten the sanding ledge to the supports with four No. 6 X      1 " flathead wood screws (countersunk to insure a smooth      surface ) . . . then lock the legs to the base, using four      No. 6 X 1-1/2" wood screws placed so that one enters each      support from the front, and one passes into each from the      base.    </p>    <p>      You can then complete the combination sander/cutter by      tacking a couple of 3/4" X 1-1/2" X 20" wooden feet below      each flank of the mounting platform. Once that's done,      you'll be ready to bolt or clamp the tool to a convenient      work surface, loop a belt between it and the cycle power      chassis, and have at an appropriate piece of wood (with the      help of a willing-and physically fit-friend, of      course). And, if the idea of pedaling up your power doesn't      strike your fancy, you can still use this two-in-one device      by simply attaching an electric motor to the platform . . .      and letting the power company do the work.    </p>
