                <p>      <strong>In nature, things are not always as they      seem.</strong></p>      <h5 id="byline">By Terry Kraustwurst    </h5>         <p>      The firefly, a male Photinus pyralis, winks his best      come-on wink as he flies through the summer night: Turning      on his light for precisely half a second while swooping      upward, he scribes a tiny illuminated "j" in the blackness.      Light off, he cruises seven seconds, then-swoop,      blink, another "j." Over and over, he trips his light      fantastic in seven-second cadence. On the grass below, an      appreciative female answers each "j" three seconds later      with a half-second glow, a response that identifies her as      a P. pyralis too, and a willing one at that. Encouraged, he      draws near and lands next to his newfound mate. The female      turns to him, grasps him in her forelegs-and,      crushing his body between powerful jaws, devours her      would-be lover's juicy innards.    </p>    <p>      Such are the dining habits of female Photuris fireflies, a      whole different genus. Having cracked the code of the      others' love talk, they lure in tasty Photinus      males-and meals-by mimicking the come-hither      flashes of Photinus females.    </p>    <p>      Sneaky? Yes, but hardly unique in nature. Mimicry-the      practice of imitating something you're not to gain some      kind of advantage-is widespread. Bugs do it, birds do      it, reptiles and amphibians and even mammals do it. It's a      predator-eats-prey world out there, and a little evolved      trickery can mean survival.    </p>		<h3>HIDERS AND HOLLERERS</h3>           <p>      The simplest form of mimicry is Camouflage. The fundamental      idea with camo, though, is not to imitate some other      creature, but some other thing. The benefit in a locust      treehopper resembling a locust thorn, a toad the pebbles on      which it hops, a snake the leaves in which it slithers, is      plain. A predator is less likely to bother you when you      seem inanimate and inedible.    </p>    <p>      Not all pretenders in nature are duck-and-hide types,      however. Others have evolved quite the opposite strategy      and wear bold patterns and bright colors.    </p>    <p>      In some cases the patterns serve to create a momentary      diversion. Scientists suspect that the lines around the      edges of butterfly wings, for example, look like      caterpillars to birds. Pecking for a meal of luscious      larva, the bird winds up with a beak full of dry wing      scales while the butterfly flutters away-tattered,      perhaps, but alive.    </p>    <p>      The round "eye spots" on the wings of many moths and      butterflies produce a Similar effect. Most insectivores go      for the head -the nerve center-to subdue their      prey. Aiming for the "eyes," a predator merely punches a      hole in a wing and gives its quarry time to flee.    </p>    <p>      Eye spots can play another deceptive role. At rest, a      large-winged moth or butterfly may seem a tempting target.      But when a predator comes too near, the insect has a      surprise in store. Opening its wings, it flashes its large      eye spots- "Boo!" Startled by the sudden appearance      of an animal's face, the predator leaves in a hurry.    </p>    <p>      Other creatures also sport distinctive designs and colors      intended to frighten-but it's no act. Their colors      are a fair warning, loud and clear: "Here I am, and I'm      bad. Steer clear if you know what's good for you."    </p>    <p>      Many animals and insects that taste awful, sting or can      otherwise turn a good day sour have adapted this      warning-label strategy, known as aposematic coloration.      It's effective, too-just check your own reaction next      time you encounter a small, furry four-legger with white      stripes clown its black back and tail. You're outta there.    </p>    <h3>      WHO'S FOOLING WHOM?    </h3>            <p>      Warning colors work by teaching predators hard lessons.      When you take a bite of a yellow-and-black-striped buzzing      thing and-Ouch!-get stung, you tend there-after      to avoid putting yellow-and-black-striped buzzing things in      your mouth.    </p>    <p>      This explains, at least partially, two phenomena: (1) why      many of the bees and wasps you see rear similar yellow and      black stripes, and (2) why there's a good chance at least      some of the "bees" and "wasps" flying around couldn't hurt      a fly-and may, in fact, be flies.    </p>    <p>      A variety of insects, including some beetles and moths,      mimic hoes and wasps. The most common impostors are the      syrphid flies: nectar-loving hover flies, drone flies and      more. Most syrphids are fat, fuzzy and buzzy like bees;      some are slim and hardbodied like wasps.    </p>    <p>      The supposition, of course, is that the unarmed and      perfectly edible insects have, over the eons, developed the      same striped uniform as the bees and wasps for defen sive      purposes. Predators that have learned a painful lesson from      the real stinging thing will avoid the impostors, too.    </p>    <p>      In scientific circles this idea-an edible species      benefiting by imitating a noxious one-is known as      Batesian mimicry. It's named after Henry Bates, a mid-1800s      naturalist who roamed Brazilian forests collecting      butterflies. Bates noticed that in many cases two      similar-looking but different species shared distinct      colors and patterns. He theorized that one species tasted      had and kept predators away by advertising its      <em>patooey</em> presence. The impostor species gained the      same advantage even though it didn't taste bad.    </p>    <p>      You may have learned all about this in biology class.      According to recent research, though, you may not have      learned it exactly right. Mimicry, it turns out, can he as      tricky as the pretenders themselves.    </p>    <p>      Take the oft-cited classic case of Batesian mimicry      involving the dead-ringer resemblance between monarch and      viceroy butterflies. For decades scientists thought that      all adult monarchs carried within them the hitter      aftertaste of their larval-stage milkweed diets, and thus      were Unpalatable to birds and other predators. Viceroys      were thought to be the edible mimics who benefited from the      monarchs' distasteful reputation.    </p>    <p>      But when a graduate student at the University of Florida      tested the notion by offering the bodies of both types to      hungry blackbirds, he found-much to the scientific      community's surprise-that both types taste had to      birds. This kind of mimicry, in which both look-alike      species are noxious, is known as Mullerian mimicry. There's      no fraud involved, but both species benefit because      predators nibbling at either learn to avoid the other, too.    </p>           <p>      Unfortunately, it turns out the monarchs and viceroys can't      be netted into that neat category, either. Further studies      suggest that some monarchs and some viceroys are palatable,      while others are not. So who's mimicking whom, and why?      Listen carefully, and you may hear the faint sound of      puzzled biologists scratching their heads.    </p>    <p>      Likewise for the aforementioned syrphid flies, long      considered obvious and classic mimics of wasps and bees.      Naturally any bird that bites a bee is going to learn in a      hurry to avoid all bee-like insects.    </p>    <p>      Well, yes and no. Scientists now know that many birds with      eyesight sufficiently keen to discern striped      patterns-phoebes, swallows and martins among      them-gobble up bees and wasps with apparent relish.      Not surprisingly, they're quick to make meals of syrphid      fly look-alikes, too. So what would he the advantage of      mimicking?    </p>    <p>      Further Studies have provided at least a partial answer.      Some birds, it seems, are indeed susceptible to stings and      learn the hard way to react with "yipes" to stripes. Crows      and starlings are among birds that avoid both the real      thing and syrphids. Perhaps more significantly, toads and      frogs also keep a tight lip-and a coiled      tongue-when it comes to the insects. So the syrphids'      mimicry does indeed serve a purpose. Its not exactly      surefire insurance against predation, as was once thought,      but it does up the odds in the flies' favor.    </p>    <p>      Mimicry, it seems, teaches humans a dual lesson: In nature,      you can never be sure of what you see ... or of what you      think you know.    </p>
