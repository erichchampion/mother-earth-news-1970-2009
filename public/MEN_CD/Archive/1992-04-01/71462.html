        			<p><strong>     COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>         <h5 id="byline">      By John J. Mettler Jr.D.V.M    </h5>     <p>      A few years ago I realized a lifelong dream in Switzerland - I      watched the cows trek from the valley stables to the      mountain pastures. The big brown cows wore flowers around      their necks and on their heads. They strode rapidly along      the autobahns and through the village streets, cowbells      chiming. The lead cow, wearing the largest flower      arrangement and most decorative strapped bell, needed no      one to guide her. She knew she was heading for green grass.    </p>    <p>      Seeing cows go to pasture always lifts my spirits after a      long winter. I don't know whether it's due to my childhood      experience or my Swiss ancestry. During my early years of      practice, we were sometimes plagued in March with sick      cattle, which would not respond until we could get them out      on grass. I used to count the evenings when the beautiful      sound of spring peepers would be heard. After hearing the      frogs three or four times, I knew there would be enough      grass on the south side of some hill, where a sick cow      could be turned.    </p>    <p>      Today we have better knowledge of harvesting roughage and      feeding/caring for cattle. We don't experience problems      with acetonemia, displaced abomasum, and slow recovery of      sick animals which plagued us 40 years ago. I now read of      dairy farmers who return to pasture management from the      extreme of zero pasture. But the magic of green grass is      not always the answer - sometimes it causes problems.      From the questions that MOTHER receives, it is clear that      not all of our readers are able to avoid late winter health      problems with their livestock. Let's address a few      questions:    </p>        <p>      <strong>Q. Early last spring, we turned our family Jersey      cow and our small beef herd of Hereford out onto winter      wheat before the grass pasture was ready. Two days later      the milk cow went down and into a coma, as if she had milk      fever. I called our veterinarian, who saved her life with      intravenous calcium and magnesium treatment. She said the      cow did not have milk fever, but a similar disease called      "grass tetany," which is caused by too little magnesium.      She also said that the beef cattle could get the disease.      At her suggestion, we pulled them off the wheat and turned      them to the grass pasture, supplemented with some hay. The      veterinarian also told me it was possible to prevent grass      tetany by fertilizing with magnesium, but one could never      be entirely sure. We'd like to be able to pasture wheat      again this year. Is there a safe way to do it?</strong>    </p>    <p>      A. There are so many factors known and unknown about grass      tetany that one can never be sure about prevention or      treatment. It affects cattle and sheep, usually those in      heavy lactation. It is known even in steers, and can be      fatal if not detected in time. Most importantly, it is seen      in cattle raised on highly fertilized pasture, particularly      where a lot of nitrogen is used. Wheat pasture is most apt      to cause it, but I have seen it on wild unfertilized      pasture during cold, wet springs. Stress - such as      too many hours without feed - is another contributing      factor. Cows prone to milk fever, such as your Jersey, are      also more prone.    </p>    <p>      <strong>It is surprising how both<br /> cattle and sheep will<br />      leave nice green pasture<br /> to chew on dry hay.</strong>    </p>    <p>      To prevent grass tetany, spray pasture with a 2% magnesium      sulphate solution (epsom salts, 2 pounds to 12 1/2 gallons      of water) just before turning animals out. Liming with high      magnesium lime during the fall is another solution.      Remember that young, fast-growing green plants are low on      magnesium.    </p>    <p>      You might be able to prevent grass tetany on wheat this      spring by turning only non-milking animals out to chew it      down first. Or turn the milking animals out for only a few      hours at a time, making sure their bellies are full of dry      hay first. With a small herd, try throwing piles of dry hay      around the pasture for the first week. It is surprising how      both cattle and sheep will leave nice green pasture to chew      on dry hay. As I think back on cases of grass tetany I've      seen, most occurred during wet, cold springs when cattle      were suddenly put on pasture both day and night from barn      feeding.    </p>    <p>      Looking ahead, sow winter rye instead of wheat next fall.      Rye makes good pasture in spring too, and the incidence of      grass tetany is less than on wheat. It is important to know      that grass tetany can occur in cattle and sheep even on      good pasture, particularly those in full milk production      during cold, wet springs. Watch animals closely for such      early symptoms as staggering or weakness before they go      down. If they do go down, get veterinary help immediately.      Ordinary milk-fever treatment won't help, and mixtures      containing potassium and/or phosphorous can kill.    </p>    		<p>      <strong>Q. Last fall we were given Cocoa, a beautiful      Shetland pony mare to keep for the winter. At the time, the      owner gave us instructions on care and feeding. Although he      intended to pick Cocoa up in the spring, a letter came in      January saying he would not return. The pony was ours to      keep. A postscript on the letter said "Don't turn Cocoa out      to pasture until the cows have chewed it down a bit." What      is he referring to?</strong>    </p>    <p>      A. Most ponies and many heavy draft-type horses, will      founder (develop acute laminitis) with the sudden change to      lush green pasture. The condition also occurs if they are      over-fed grain or have unlimited access to fermented feeds,      such as silage.    </p>    <p>      Founder is a condition in which the space between the      sensitive and the insensitive part of the hoof becomes      engorged with blood. The reason why is not completely      understood. The affected animal will appear to be "glued to      the ground" or severely lame, carrying its weight around on      its rear legs. At first glance, one might think the rear      feet are affected, but it's usually the front feet. The      hooves will feel hot, and one can detect a definite pulse      on the rear outside of the pastern bone. If not properly      cared for, permanent lameness will develop. Such animal      grow long narrow hooves, curved up in front like sled      runners.    </p>    <p>      Preventing "grass founder," or any form of founder, is      critical. Don't turn ponies, draft horses, or even light      horses with draft-type characteristics from barn feed to      unrestricted lush grass pasture. Avoid sudden changes in      feeding, and reduce grain intake on horse heavily worked      and laid up for a day without exercise. Don't give a hot      horse grain, and only give your horse small amounts of      water at a time until it is cooled out.    </p>    <p>      For first aid, think cold. Either stand the horse in cold      water or wrap its feet with burlap bags soaked in cold      water. Be sure to get veterinary help immediately. Some      acute cases of founder will be lost regardless of      treatment, so make prevention top priority. Until a few      years ago, many horse with chronic laminitis were permanent      cripples. Today skilled farmers and veterinarians, using      painkillers, hoof surgery, and epoxy fillers all help      greatly, and bring some horses back to complete      functioning.    </p>				   <p>      <strong>Q. Last spring our family cow stopped eating her      grain, just a few weeks after we turned her out to pasture.      I thought this was because she was so full of grass. She      came in one evening with her udder nearly empty, and only a      few squirts of thick milk came out of each quarter. One      neighbor said she had mastitis and suggested I treat her      with mastitis syringes from the feed store. I did this, but      her udder stayed soft and slack. She didn't give enough      milk, so I dried her off. A few weeks later she aborted a      five-month calf. We fattened her and butchered her last      fall, and bought a nice little Jersey for milk.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Another neighbor, who used to dairy farm years ago,      told me the first cow didn't have mastitis since her udder      was not hard and swollen. He said it was "buttercup      poisoning," common in areas with lots of blooming      buttercups. Our new Jersey cow is milking fine, and has      become a family pet. Soon we will run out of hay, and will      need to use the pasture where the buttercups grow. Any      suggestions?</strong>    </p>    <p>      A. It sounds as though your first cow had a case of      leptospiroses infection. "Lepto" is about the only      generalized disease that a lone cow will come down with      despite direct/indirect contact with other cattle. The      causative agent is not buttercups, but a bacteria carried      by any number of wild and domestic animal species. The      organism is present in the urine of recovered individuals,      and can live outside their bodies in still water above      65°F.    </p>    <p>      Leptospira organisms can reach a small pond or puddle from      the urine of a carrier animal. If your animal drinks the      water, it becomes susceptible. Although the organism will      most likely die when your animal ingests it, it is      infective if sprayed into your animal's nostril or eye.    </p>    <p>      Symptoms include fever, diminished appetite, and reduced      milk production. After a few days of the disease, what      little milk the cow does have will be thick. Unlike      mastitis, there will be no swelling or hardness of the      udder. Appetite gradually returns, but milk production      usually stays very low. During the fever stage of the      disease, the fetus in a pregnant cow will die. However, it      is not likely to be aborted until weeks or even months go      by.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Anyone who owns livestock should<br /> have a thermometer      and a<br /> speaking relationship with a<br /> local      veterinarian</strong>    </p>    <p>      Prevention of lepto is accomplished by immunizing with a      bacterin for the particular lepto in your area. Your local      veterinarian will know which bacterin is best to      administer, as well as the best time of year to do so. In      areas where lepto is a big problem, one dose of bacterin is      usually given prior to pasture season, and another in late      summer. A third dosage is sometimes given in fall (prior to      stabling), depending on housing and herd size.    </p>    <p>      Anyone who owns livestock should have a thermometer and a      speaking relationship with a local veterinarian familiar      with livestock. By having a thermometer, you could have      checked your cows temperature when she first refused to eat      the grain. After determining fever, you could have called      your vet and started early antibiotic treatment. This would      have saved the cow, her milk production, and probably the      calf she was carrying.    </p>
