                    <h5 id="byline">by ROBERTA HAMMER</h5>    <p>      A Missouri cold spell has reminded us that winter is close,      and most of that stuff we had to get done "before winter"      is not done! The water pump is not enclosed in insulation,      the goat shed and the chicken room have not had their      drafts checked, the new garden spot for next spring has not      been tilled, and the 5 acre pasture did not get seeded to      alfalfa. We DID get the outhouse moved (something we had      been putting off, for obvious reasons) to a new location.    </p>    <p>      The outhouse-moving was a fantastic scene. We had no heavy      chain, so we used swing chains . . . and they broke every      few feet. Besides that, the old tractor has a bad clutch      and Keith had to sit with the pedal pushed in for five or      ten minutes every time before he could put it in gear. Try      to straighten up an outhouse under those conditions, over a      hole you've dug in the ground . . . then write and tell us      how you did it.    </p>    <p>      We had a long drought in the midwest this summer and,      although our garden was better than most around here, our      visions of vegetable bounty didn't materialize. We had      plenty to feed us and some to give away, but not a lot to      put up for winter, and none to sell. I think only      experience can dictate how much to plant and how much to      can and freeze. I've seen several charts on the subject . .      . all different. Anyway, most families eat different      amounts of different things, so who can tell?    </p>    <p>      I was pretty proud of my 40 jars of tomatoes and 20 of      tomato juice, but I'm afraid it's just a drop in the bucket      compared to my friend (the organic farmer's wife) who did      196 jars of tomatoes, juice and ketchup. Well, she was      raised on a farm and has been canning her own for four      years, so I'm trying not to feel too badly about it. I also      did a WHOPPING 14 pints of peaches. And, are you ready? 15      pints of green beans! I plan to can some pears off our one      and only productive fruit tree. And next year . . . . . . .      . . . .    </p>    <p>      We're still gardening and have turnips, beets, lettuce,      spinach, radishes, mustard and winter onions to eat with      the green beans and corn we're still harvesting. We've      really had to compete with critters for that sweet corn!      Grasshoppers ate off the silks, causing some ears not to      develop kernels; corn worms ate the ends of the ears; and      racoons chomped away on the fattest and best of the      remainder. No corn to freeze. I want to get started on a      cold frame next week. I hope to have fresh lettuce and      spinach for a long time.    </p>    <p>      We're planning a HUGE garden next year. We want to do much      better at putting away food, and we want enough to sell.      We've found the patients of an allergy doctor to be a good      market for organic produce. Most of them have to have pure      food and are used to paying air freight prices for produce      from California. They are desperate for nutritious,      non-poisoned food and will pay a reasonable price for it.    </p>    <p>      Early Christmas presents from Keith's parents are 10 fruit      and nut trees and 150 feet of honeysuckle hedge. We're      trying to decide where to put them so we can get the soil      prepared before October, when they'll probably be shipped.      The old orchard site is definitely not the spot since it is      full of soggy, low places.    </p>    <p>      Besides the ordered fruit trees, we are saving pits and      seeds to plant in the garden next spring so we can      experiment with grafting. I hope we will find enough fruit      tree owners willing to donate buds!    </p>    <p>      We wanted the hedge because we are right on a black-top      road and-as the local people go by-they like to      slow down and get a good long look at us! We really don't      look freaky or anything. Just busy and happy.    </p>    <p>      There is a pretty good chapter on orchards in Kains'      <em>FIVE ACRES AND INDEPENDENCE.</em> Also the September      issue of Organic Gardening Magazine had a good orchard      article.    </p>    <p>      Our greatest personal disaster of 1970 was Ann starting      first grade. The school bus picks her up at 6:55 and she is      home at 4:30. What a long day for a nearly seven year old.      Perfect training for a lifetime of despised work. Making      her go every morning is one of the hardest things I've ever      done. I wish I knew what to do about it.    </p>    <p>      We finally butchered and ate one chicken. He looked like a      big fat rooster, but he was bluffing . . . he was skinny.      We lived through the cleaning and plucking, but I didn't      eat much. We're going to wait until they're bigger and      easier to dress before we kill any more.    </p>    <p>      I hope there will be a natural food store opening in Kansas      City soon. Honey, cold-pressed oil, and rice are our most      expensive staples. I'd like to be able to get them for      less-than-healthfood prices. Maybe even barter with      produce.    </p>    <p>      We, buy our stone-ground whole wheat flour from the organic      farming couple we know. He, just 31, has been on his farm      for 10 years. What luck to meet them! Alice taught me to      bake no-knead bread which is delicious and so easy that I      make all our bread now. Here's the recipe for anyone who      has access to midwestern, soft-type wheat:    </p>   <h3> ALICE OKORN'S NO KNEAD BREAD</h3>    <p>      Mix together 5 cups warm water, 4 teasp. salt and 3/4 cup      honey.    </p>    <p>      Sprinkle 3 Tbs. El Molino bread yeast (or 4 Tbs. of      Fleischmanns or Red Star) on the water-honey mixture and      let it pop to the surface. Stir. Then add:    </p>    <p>      3/4 cup oil and 8 cups stone-ground whole wheat flour. Mix      together with a big spoon then beat until smooth with      electric mixer. By the way, do not sift the flour in this      recipe; spoon it lightly into measuring cup.    </p>    <p>      Mix in 6 more cups flour, then . . .    </p>    <p>      Mix in 2 more cups flour. At this point you may need more      or less flour. The dough should be sticky, but manageable.      Cover the bowl with towel. Let rise until double in bulk.    </p>    <p>      Punch down and stir VIGOROUSLY, Divide the dough into four      BUTTERED loaf pans (Pyrex works best). With buttered hands,      shape each into a smooth loaf. Let rise until double in      bulk. DON'T jar or bump.    </p>    <p>      Bake at 350 degrees for 45 minutes. Cool on wire racks.      Remove from pans as soon as bread pulls away from sides.    </p>    <p>      I don't know how this recipe would work with Deaf Smith      County, Texas flour. I've never tried it but I have a      feeling it might be too hard to soften and develop gluten      without kneading.    </p>    <p>      Once in a while I miss slamming bread dough around . . . so      I knead ad some biscuit dough! It will be a year or two      before we get "together" enough to plan our own wheat crop.      The vegetable gardens and orchard come first. Then alfalfa      and grain for our animals. Then maybe wheat . . . or      perhaps we'll work out a barter system with our other      homesteading and farming friends so that we don't have to      be so diversified. There are more and more of us all the      time.    </p>
