                    <div class="sidebar">      <p>        Ken Kern, author of THE OWNER-BUILT HOME and THE        OWNER-BUILT HOMESTEAD, is an amazing fellow and everyone        interested in decentralist, back-to-the-land, rational        living should know of his work. Back in 1948 he began        collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural        construction materials and techniques. He combed the        world for ideas, tried them and started writing about his        experiments.      </p>      <p>        Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's        articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN        REVOLUTION. Ken has also issued a three year series of        pieces (called TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun        pit design of his has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.      </p>      <p>        This installment of Ken's work is taken from OWNER-BUILT        HOME. I'll be featuring never before published material        from OWNERBUILT HOMESTEAD in my No. 7 issue. Again, I        have to apologize for jumping back and forth as I reprint        Ken's excellent material, but that's the way I have to do        it and Ken's writing makes it all worthwhile.      </p>      <p>        -MOTHER      </p>    </div>    <h3>      INTRODUCTION    </h3>    <p>      I am intending this to be a how-to-think-it as well as a      how-to-do-it book. As a designer-builder of contemporary      homes-a self-appointed specialist in the low-cost      field-I have long had the compulsion to express my      feelings and thoughts in regard to the home-building      industry, and to do something constructive for the people      who are now suffering under it. I have yet to find one      critic who comprehends entirely why our houses are so      poorly constructed, why they look so abominable, why they      cost so much for building and upkeep, and why they are so      uncomfortable. Some critics blame the building contractors      personally; others feel that the fault lies with urban      codes and building restrictions. Some believe that      expensive housing is due to the high interest rates charged      by the bankers; others blame the trade unions for hampering      efficient construction. Every writer on the subject seems      to fondle some pet corrective measure. And every year some      noted architect develops a sure-fire technical solution to      the housing problem. Even more often the building material      manufacturers come up with a new wonder; an improved      wallboard or window or what-not which can be installed with      a ten-minute saving in labor!    </p>    <p>      Everyone in the building industry appears to be busily      engaged making "improvements" in his personal area of      concern. But quality makes a steady decline. The end      product is as inadequate and unsatisfactory and costly a      house as ever. The architect spends more and more time at      his drafting board, exhausting possibilities of new      construction techniques and more economical arrangements;      the contractor conscripts even more and specialized      equipment for building efficiency; the banker resorts to      undreamt-of-schemes to make it possible for everyone to buy      his new home-even if he lacks money to make the down      payment; building material manufacturers work overtime in      their laboratories making "more and better things for      better living." With all this hustle one might well expect      some major improvements in new home construction. Whatever      improvements occur are insignificant in comparison to the      improvements that should be made. The causes of the world's      housing problem still remain.    </p>    <p>      Tracing these causes to their sources has helped me to view      the problem in perspective-comprehensively. This      procedure has also suggested some workable alternatives as      solutions to personal housing needs. Here they are in the      form of seven axioms for the Owner-Built Home.    </p>    <p>      1. <strong>BUILD ACCORDING TO YOUR OWN BEST      JUDGMENT.</strong> At the apex of the poor building      hierarchy-and perhaps the greatest single impediment      to good housing-is convention. Building convention      takes two forms; first, there is convention which is      socially instilled (commonly called <em>style</em> ), which      can be altered through education. The second type is more      vicious, and politically enforced. Building codes, zoning      restrictions, and ordinances all fall into this clas s. In      urban jurisdictions, politically controlled convention      calls the shots for practically every segment of the      building industry. Ordinance approval or disapproval makes      the difference between having a house or having none at      all. Or it may make a difference of $1,000 (average)-wasted      because of stupid, antiquated building laws.    </p>    <p>      So if we are to be at liberty to build our own home at less      cost, we must necessarily be free from all building code      jurisdiction. This means we must locate outside of urban      control-in the country or small township districts.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. IN BUILDING YOUR HOME, PAY AS YOU GO.</strong> A      building loan is another type of legalized robbery, added      to that of the building codes. More than any other agency,      banks have been successful in reducing would-be-democratic      man to a state of perpetual serfdom. The bankers have      supported and helped to determine social and political      convention, and have amassed phenomenal fortunes through      unearned increment. As "friends" of the home-owner they      have made it possible for him to take immediate possession      of his new home-and pay for it monthly for 20 to 30      years. Most people who fall into this trap fail to realize      that the accumulating interest on their 30-year mortgage      comes to more than double the market value of their home!      If one expects any success at all in keeping the costs of      his new home down to a reasonable price, he must keep      entirely free from interest rates.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. ASSUME RESPONSIBILITY FOR YOUR BUILDING      CONSTRUCTION.</strong> The general contractor has become      such a key functionary in practically every building      operation that one soon loses sight of the fact that he is      a relative newcomer to the housing scene. Not many years      ago the contractor's job was performed by a supervising      carpenter-a so-called master builder who had control      of the whole project. Once people realize how little is      involved in implementing a set of house plans, they will      better appreciate the fact that the contractor is the most      expendable element on any job.    </p>    <p>      Excessive profits are made by the general contractor for      coordinating the work stages and assuming the      responsibility for a satisfactory completion at a specified      cost. For this service he receives 10% of the total cost of      your house. Besides, he receives an even greater percentage      on all materials which go into the structure. The      contractor is an expensive and non-essential luxury for the      low-income home builder.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. USE NATIVE MATERIALS WHENEVER POSSIBLE.</strong>      Much of an architect's time is spent in keeping abreast of      the new "improved" building materials which manufacturers      make each month. Many of the products are really      worthwhile; but more often than not they are entirely      beyond the reach of the average home builder. Basic      materials, like common cement and structural 2 x 4's, have      not appreciably advanced in price over the past dozen      years. But some of the newer surfacing materials and      interior fixtures have sky-rocketed in price during this      same period.    </p>    <p>      By not using these high-cost materials, one of course nips      the problem in the bud. Instead, emphasis should be placed      on readily available natural resources-materials that      come directly from the site or from a convenient hauling      distance. Rock and earth and concrete and timber and all      such materials have excellent structural and heat      regulating qualities when properly used.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. SUPPLY YOUR OWN LABOR.</strong> Building Trades      Unions have received-and not unjustly so-a      notorious reputation as wasters of speed and efficiency in      building work. We all know that painters are restricted to      the 4-inch brush and that carpenters are limited to the      14-oz. hammer (upon threat of penalty from union      officials). Apparently more width and weight might      conceivably speed up a project to the point where some      union man would prove expendable.    </p>    <p>      The disinterest that the average journeyman has in his      work, despite his high union pay rate, is appalling. The      lack of joy-in-work or acceptance of responsibility among      average workmen can be accounted for partly by the      de-humanizing effect of the whole wage system. So long as      the "master-and-slave" type of employer-employee      relationship continues to exist in our society, one can      expect only the worst performance from his hired "help". So      until the dawn of the New Era approaches, one would do well      from an economic, as well as from a self-satisfying      standpoint, to supply his own labor for his own home      insofar as he can.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6. DESIGN AND PLAN YOUR OWN HOME.</strong> Another      ten-percenter with whom we can well afford to dispense in      building a low-cost home is the      architect-designer-craftsman-supervisor. Experience in this      branch of home building has led me to the conclusion that      <em>anyone</em> can and everyone <em>should</em> design his      own home. There is only one possible drawback here; the      owner-builder must know what he wants in a home and must be      familiar with the building site and regional climatic      conditions. Without close acquaintance with the site and a      clear understanding of family living needs, the project is      doomed to failure no matter who designs the house. An      architect-even a good architect-cannot      interpret a client's building needs better than the client      himself. Anyway, most contemporary architects design houses      for themselves, not their clients. They work at satisfying      some esthetic whim, and fail really to understand the      character of the site and the personal requirements of the      client.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. USE MINIMUM BUT QUALITY GRADE HAND      TOOLS.</strong> If the house design is kept simple, and the      work program well organized, an expensive outlay in      specialized construction equipment can be saved. The      building industry has been mechanized to absurd dimensions.      And even with more and better power tools, labor costs      rise. Or at times where labor savings occur, the difference      is taken up in the depreciation and maintenance of the      equipment which saved the time in the first place. Whatever      way you look at it, a certain amount of work must go into      building a home. If a prospective home owner is unprepared      to accept the challenge of building his own home-and      falls into the power tool trap-then he must be      prepared to spend greater sums for a product which could      very well prove inferior.    </p>    <p>      Now that I have presented the <em>ideal</em> program for      the owner-built home, I should retrace my steps and face      the sheer realities of the situation. Obviously, not all      people can locate their home site out of building code      jurisdiction. Nor can many people expect to finance their      home from their weekly pay check. Very few people have the      native ability to design an inexpensive and attractive      home-one that truly fits their needs and site      conditions. Even more rare is the person who can carry      through all phases of building construction, or who even      has the necessary free time to devote to a house building      effort. And how many people do you know who could take the      raw material resources and process them into building      materials for wall, roof, and floor? One has only to      observe current owner-built home flops to appreciate the      fact that we are dealing with a disturbingly complex      problem-a problem that demands a comprehensive      solution.    </p>    <p>      It is unquestionably our drive toward specialization      (stemming from a basic failure on the part of our whole      educational system) which is primarily responsible for      modern man's inability to provide directly for his own      shelter needs. Despite this drift, I sincerely believe that      the owner-built home can be an economic as well as esthetic      success. It <em>has</em> been so for centuries, for      thousands of families-if not millions-and      continues to be so today. Furthermore, the process of      building one's home can become one of the most meaningful      and satisfying experiences in one's life-as indeed it      should. Owing to the physical limitations of the      owner-builder, and those impositions fostered by society in      the form of restrictions and general mis-education, one can      expect only to <em>approach</em> the completely      self-tailored home. On one or more scores compromises are      in order, but to the extent that the owner retains full      control over his design and his work, he is successfully      participating in creative building.    </p>    <p>      My limited experience in the building design and      construction field in this country has taught me one very      important lesson; satisfactory progress with the low-cash      cost, owner-built home can come only after an entirely new      approach to materials, structure, finished appearance and      the occupants' basic pattern of living. I view our existing      ego-inflated, overmaterialistic and downright absurd      housing forms as gross impediments to the sort of rational      and economic building that is actually possible and      desirable. But to find <em>intelligence</em> in housing      today one must go to the countries which, out of sheer      necessity, are beginning to approach the housing problem at      its roots.    </p>    <p>      In Asia, for instance, 150 million families live in      overcrowded and unsanitary quarters. Some countries, like      India, are attacking this situation with energy and      imagination. A series of Aided Self-Help programs are      included in the Indian government's three-year Community      Development plan. At the International Exhibition on Low      Cost Housing held at New Delhi a few years ago, a complete      model village was on display. Over 30,000 people visited      this village each day; it proved to be the most successful      low cash-cost demonstration center in the world. None of      the dwellings in this village cost over $1,000. Besides the      wide variety of domestic buildings, the village contained a      school, health clinic, co-op store, carpentry shop and      smithy. The village was laid out with proper regard to      water supply, drainage, lighting and street planning. This      demonstration center also illustrated the wide variety of      low cash-cost materials available; reeds, aluminum, gypsum,      hessian, rammed earth, and concrete-employed in new      and more imaginative ways.    </p>    <p>      The new structural ideas, uses of materials, and methods of      design that result from an effort such as the New Delhi      Exhibition mark a tremendous architectural      advance-but the <em>human</em> advance behind the      scenes is even <em>greater.</em> The best thinkers in their      field have been on the job. Men like Kurt Billig, director      of the Central Building Research Institute (Roorkee), A. L.      Glen, (Pretoria), and G. F. Middleton, Commonwealth      Experimental Building Station (North Ryde, New South Wales,      Australia) could command the highest fees from those most      able to pay. Instead, they contribute their vast store of      building knowledge and imagination to the greatest housing      needs of our age. Architect Joseph Allen Stein, head of the      Dept. of Architecture at Bengal (India) Engineering      College, summed up my sentiments in effect when he made the      following statement at the New Delhi exhibition:    </p>    <p>      Centuries of privation, of social and economic inequality,      have conditioned vast numbers of human beings to endure      surroundings that can only be called sub-human. Today,      architects, engineers and planners are called upon to show      that a pleasant, healthful, human environment need no      longer be the monopoly of a fortunate few.    </p>    <p>      It is a rarity of the first order when a dean of an      architectural college takes it upon himself to build houses      out of woven split bamboo between two layers of treated      clay! These readily available materials were artfully used      by Professor Stein in his creation of two demonstration      low-cost homes. In his own words, the design    </p>    <p>      was worked out so that under proper conditions of community      organization, such buildings can be built by village      families with their contributed labor, without dependence      on extra-village materials- <em>on the basis of a      program of guided self-help.</em> The skill required for      this type of construction is readily acquired; a      two-months' apprenticeship is usually considered time for      man to become a skilled bamboo worker.    </p>    <p>      If properly used, bamboo and clay construction can be      expected to last as long as many manufactured materials      that are considered to make permanent industrial housing.      Standard materials for urban construction, such as      corrugated iron sheets, poorly burnt, inferior bricks, or      unseasoned wood can hardly be expected to last 25 years      under average urban conditions. Yet even in the extremely      hot humid climate of West Bengal and Assam, there are many      clay and bamboo structures of 40 years of age. When      replacement or repair is required due either to accident or      deterioration of age, the materials are readily at hand,      and the householder himself can do the work. The roof is of      such a design that repairs can be made to any portion      without affecting, or having to break up, the remaining      part.    </p>    <p>      (The rural house) . . . is constructed of only three      materials; it utilizes wood for the roof framing; the      remainder of the construction is of earth (clay) and      bamboo. In villages where wood is not readily and cheaply      at hand, bamboo can be substituted. The sole purchase from      outside the village is creosote, or other preservative      materials; desirable to prolong the life of the structure.    </p>        <p>      Some of the world's "underprivileged" countries maintain a      caliber of low-cost housing research which surpasses that      of the far more wealthy countries such as our own. More      significant research material is coming out of the South      African Research Institute, for instance, than from all the      HHFA, FHA, FPHA agencies combined. A recent housing      development in South Africa (illustrated above) made use of      such construction features as "no-fines" concrete (crushed      stone and cement) for surface beds, and single thick brick      internal walls-plastered on both sides. Detailed      investigations were made on every item of expense that went      into the experimental house.    </p>    <p>      In this hemisphere the most important low cost, owner-built      housing research is being done at the Inter-American      Housing and Planning Center (Bogota, Columbia). Two years      ago this agency built a demonstration soil-cement house at      a cash cost of $375. Designed for the cool climate      prevalent on the Andean plains, the house has a living      room, kitchen, two bedrooms, covered porch, storage room,      shower, and laundry area, apart from an outside latrine.      Roof members were constructed with eucalyptus tree limbs.      Common clay tile was used for the roof, placed with a mud      mixture on a frame of split bamboo. The floor was      constructed of tamped earth, covered with a layer of weak      cement and soil-cement floor tiles.    </p>    <p>      My personal approach to housing utilizes technical features      similar to those of the low-cost housing research mentioned      above. In following chapters on the subject, however, I      introduce an <em>evolutional</em> frame of reference. The      sort of house that I propose involves a process of growth      and development for its realization-not only from the      first conception of design and plan to the final nail that      is driven, but also an internal growth and maturation on      the part of the owner-builder. And the end-product is as      different from the reactionary contractor-built,      bank-sponsored, tract house as it is from the revolutionary      architect-designed, owner-financed suburban home.    </p>    <p>      What distinguishes my proposed evolutionary form of      owner-built home is its <em>fitness for purpose and      pleasantness in use.</em> Volume I of my thesis, under the      heading SITE AND CLIMATE, concerns the ways and means by      which one can relate the house to regional and landscape      conditions-heat and cold. Volume II includes chapters      which evaluate the potential MATERIALS AND SKILLS that go      into the owner-built home. Volume III deals with FORM AND      FUNCTION-the actual room planning aspects of the      owner-built home. Finally, Volume IV has to do with DESIGN      AND STRUCTURE. In this series I discuss at length the      various components of the house itself-from      foundation to roof covering.    </p>    <p>      In my judgment, a positive philosophical outlook and way of      life must necessarily precede the achievement of a quality      owner-built home. This is to say that a truly satisfying      home must <em>develop</em> from other and more subtle      patterns. The mere technical problems of building a home      are insignificant when compared to an understanding and      interpretation of one's innermost feelings and thoughts      concerning his shelter needs. But if these feelings and      thoughts are not consistently related and released in daily      activity, or if they become life-negative in orientation,      then one might just as well discount the prospect of      creating a satisfying home.    </p>    <p>      Thoreau said:    </p>    <p>      What of architectural beauty I now see, I know has      gradually grown from within outward, out of the necessities      and character of the indweller, <em>who is the only      builder-</em> out of some unconscious truthfulness,      and nobleness, without ever a thought for the appearance,      and whatever additional beauty of this kind is destined to      be produced will be preceded by a like unconscious beauty      of life.    </p>    <h3>      BUILDING SITE    </h3>        <p>      The above sketch illustrates some of the more important      site conditions which can and should play a dominant role      in influencing the design of the well-planned, owner-built      home. Influences of site on building design are little      understood and little appreciated aspects of conventional      building construction. Nevertheless, they are aspects which      affect every person who uses the building. The realized      design, in turn, affects the site, and these two features      condition one's life and plans for years to come.    </p>    <p>      It seems entirely logical to me that every individually      designed home should have more than the usual degree of      site planning. Besides being expressive of its owner's      life, a home should be at one with its site and regional      ethos. A man building his own home can afford to spend the      time necessary to acquaint himself with the      physionomic-climate site environment. The speculative or      commercial builder usually fails to take enough time from      his actual house-building program to know the character of      the land upon which he is building. Results of this neglect      are always unfortunate.    </p>        <p>      When the individual prospective home builder becomes      acquainted with even a few of the specific site conditions      found on his plot, he will come to appreciate the fact that      sites tend to vary as much as people. No two sites are the      same; no two regions are the same; no two climates are the      same. Hence every building design problem must be solved      individually. I should add, of course, that no two persons      are the same, nor do they have the same needs. We are      dealing with three independent, though inter-related,      components; people, site and building. Both visually and      actually, the building exists only in relationship to the      site and surrounding landscape. And in the same manner, the      site exists in relation to people-through the      introduction of the house.    </p>    <p>      It is important to consider the house and site as one      indivisible whole. The house-planning and site-planning      process must go on together, with equal consideration to      the design of every square foot of indoor-outdoor space.      Lawns and workshops and gardens contain essences of their      own; and it is as important to the total design concept      that these be adequately expressed as it is that the      essence of "living room" be expressed. It is something of a      help to think of the house and site as a coordinating      grouping of related indoor and outdoor rooms. In      contemporary design work we are apt to concern ourselves      with the psychophysiological requirements of interior      space, and exclude a consideration for the equally strong      need which people have for a satisfying relationship to the      outdoors. The control or lack of control of climate can be      as important a design feature as the determination of the      refinement of interior surface materials. One's      relationship to view or to plants can be an extremely      significant design feature, as I will try to illustrate.    </p>    <p>      The so-called "Contraspatial" house grew out of thi's      integrity-of-the-site concept. Another type, the      "Bi-nuclear" house, has also been gaining popularity in      recent years. But for every serious attempt to achieve      integration of house to site, you will find a thousand      houses peppering the landscape which clearly demonstrate      the builder's total disregard for even the most basic      consideration of sun, wind and view. In between these      extremes you will find scores of half-baked efforts which      try hard to achieve some semblance of site-relationship. I      am more critical of these latter abortive efforts than of      the former. The contractor-built tract home is at least an      <em>honest</em> failure, since it doesn't even try for      integration.    </p>    <p>      A few examples of the half-baked or "modern" efforts may      suffice as forewarnings to the owner-builder in his      approach to site planning.    </p>    <p>      The urge for a dramatic architectural effect usually impels      the modern designer to place the structure on the most      prominent position of the site. Or, for ease of      construction and access, the house is located on the most      level portion of the site, irrespective of associated,      outdoor functions. Actually, it is the <em>outdoor</em>      functions which require level gound; the house itself can      be located on precipitous topography, often to great      advantage. It is usually a mistake to build upon the most      beautiful, most level section of the site. Once this area      is covered with massive structure, its original charm is      destroyed.    </p>    <p>      The "machine-for-living" approach to house-design and      site-planning is about as false to man's true living needs      as the art-for-art's sake approach is to his practical      needs. In the former case, all important rooms in the house      are oriented due south-irrespective of outlook or interior      planning. The idea, of course, is to achieve maximum      heat-gain in winter, and minimum heat-gain in summer. All      the rooms end up with the same lighting conditions, as all      the rooms have the same amount of south-oriented glass.    </p>    <p>      Glass is one material very much misused by modern      designers. They respond to the bring-the-outdoors-in notion      with floor-to-ceiling sheets of crystal. Paradoxically, the      opposite effect is usually created; namely, claustrophobia,      which results in the urge to break the glass and get out!      Obviously, the glass restricts an easy ingress and egress,      though it succeeds in <em>suggesting</em> such movement.    </p>    <p>      The "picture window" is, of course, the epitome of the      mistaken bringing-the-outdoors-in notion, now held by      ding-bat contractors everywhere. Picture windows are to      homes what show-windows are to stores. They extend the      market-place mentality with its display of things. In      essence, the picture window provides a vicarious      experience; more people can sit in their armchairs and      <em>look</em> at, not live with, nature.    </p>    <p>      My final example of the ways in which modern dwellings fail      in integrating house to site has to do with view. When one      is fortunate enough to have a site with a dramatic      outlook-especially to the south or east-the      natural inclination is to orient all the major rooms toward      that direction, and to use glass in as much of the      view-wall as structurally feasible. A house so      constructed speaks to me of arrogance and greedy      self-importance. At best the end result is unpleasant and      distracting,    </p>    <p>      On the matter of view, we can learn much from Japanese      builders. (Readers of this book will find frequent      reference to Oriental architectural features. I have long      felt that the traditional Eastern forms have more to offer      the modern-day owner-builder than most of our up-to-date      source materials.) A general practice among the Japanese is      to place the house so that the same view is never seen from      more than one vantage point-except in instances where      the second view presents a contrasting element not seen by      the first. In my own design work, I try to achieve a      sequence of outlooks-from entry into the front yard      and entry into the house, to a final view stepping onto the      outdoor terrace. The owner-builder should investigate the      prospects for varieties of outlook, and perhaps employ some      of the many devices for enhancing it. One good idea is to      develop a contrasting element between the long view (such      as a distant mountain range) and short view, the      garden-patio. Again, it is unpleasant to view something      perpendicularly through glass. The Japanese stay clear of      picture-like impressions by off-setting the center-of-view      interest, and by creating hidden, around-the-corner vistas.    </p>    <p>      In his book, <em>Japanese House and Garden,</em> Dr. Jiro      Harada gives the final word on view when he tells what      Rikyu, a famed Japanese tea-master, did more than 360 years      ago to give his garden deep spiritual significance:    </p>    <p>      When his new tea-room and garden were completed at Sakai he      invited a few of his friends to a tea ceremony for the      house warming. Knowing the greatness of Rikyu, the guests      naturally expected to find some ingenious design for his      garden which would make the best use of the sea, the house      being on the slope of a hill. But when they arrived they      were amazed to find that a number of large evergreen trees      had been planted on the side of the garden, evidently to      obstruct the view of the sea. They were at a loss to      understand the meaning of this. Later when the time came      for the guests to enter the tea-room, they proceeded one by      one over the stepping-stones in the garden to the stone      water-basin to rinse their mouths and wash their hands, a      gesture of symbolic cleansings, physically and mentally,      before entering the tea-room. Then it was found that when a      guest stooped to scoop out a dipperful of water from the      water-basin, only in that humble posture was he suddenly      able to get a glimpse of the shimmering sea in the distance      by way of an opening through the trees, thus making him      realize the relationship between the dipperful of water in      his hand and the great ocean beyond, and also enabling him      to recognize his own position in the universe; he was thus      brought into a correct relationship with the infinite.    </p>    <p>      My chart No. 1 cannot indicate what is perhaps one of the      most important aspects of site planning; the site's      physiognomy; that is, the essense, spirit, or original      individuality of the site. If the owner-builder is fully      aware of his particular site-as it relates to the      ethos of the regional landscape and character of the      existing neighborhood-he will not go far wrong in his      site-planning practices. Much can be said about the human      feeling towards the setting, especially in regards to one's      immediate plot of ground-the microcosmos and      micro-climate of a half-acre lot, say. I have certainly      seen the effect that care and loving attention can have on      a setting. Really high-quality site developments result      where seemingly the only investment is imagination tempered      by a full realization of the profound assets which lie      within each site. Ambient forces were allowed to exert      their full energy, unhampered-but on the contrary,      developed-by personal re-directions.    </p>        <p>      The best approach to site development lies somewhere      between the "masterful" and "subservient" levels. One      should neither wreck the site nor fail to develop its      character. Richard Neutra speaks of the consequences of      disregard for the site's individuality:    </p>    <p>      . . . try to understand the character and peculiarities of      your site. Heighten and intensify what it may offer, never      work against its inner grain and fiber. You will pay dearly      for any such offense, though you may never clearly note      what wasting leak your happiness has sprung.    </p>    <p>      Once this "feeling-for-the-site" apsect has been achieved,      one should begin the house plan by first drawing a site      plan. (A house plan can only be drawn on a site plan; both      site and building must be regarded in the same light.)      Three general areas of space are outlined; the public area,      the private area, and the service area. Under each heading,      list all the space requirements proper to it; a      patio-garden living room, a game-play area for children; an      outdoor work area (crafts, hobby projects, auto repair);      outdoor storage facilities for garden tools, firewood,      lumber, compost; a trash-area; plant structures (lathhouse,      greenhouse, garden work-center); a vegetable garden,      fountain or swimming pool, perhaps some animals . . .    </p>    <p>      As your desires and needs are listed, the space allotments      for their satisfaction plotted on the site map, the plan      will blossom and begin to take form. Like a successful      jig-saw puzzle, each component will fall into its obvious,      unmistakable position. You will know that this particular      function must take place at this particular place on the      plan, and that this amount of space must be allocated for      this other particular need. Soon the whole scheme will      become immediately perceivable. It will be right, and you      will be sure of its rightness. And you will know when the      time has arrived for the first stage of plant arrangement      and building design.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance)<br />      <em>Mystery and Realities of the Site:</em> Richard Neutra,      1951<br />      <em>Looking Through the Picture Window:</em> Bernard      Rudofsky<br />      <em>The House:</em> Robert Woods Kennedy<br />      <em>Japanese House and Garden:</em> Jiro Harada<br />      <em>Japanese House:</em> Yoshida<br />      <em>Natural Principles of Land Use:</em> E.

Colvin    </p>    <h3>      PLANTING DESIGN    </h3>    <p>      A new approach to planting design is now in its formative      stages. Advocates of this new design-concept maintain that      the interior space should be harmoniously extended and      connected with the space outside. It is demonstrated that      the very same principles of building-design apply to the      outside planting-design. Every plant, no matter what form      it may take is a <em>construction in space</em> and an      <em>enclosure in space.</em>    </p>    <p>      As enclosures of space, plant forms expand from the walls,      floors and ceilings of rooms to the hedge-wall, lawn-floor      and tree-ceiling outdoors. Again, outdoor shelter-forms,      such as arbors, pergolas and pavilions, find      shelter-counterparts within the house. And as constructions      of space, the sculptural effects of rocks, flowers, garden      pools, and specimen plants can be likened to furnishings      and utensils of the building interior.    </p>    <p>      This integral concept of building and planting was actually      practiced by the 18th century Chinese. Called <strong>Feng      shui</strong> , the basic principle was derived from the      teachings of Lao Tze, the 6th century Chinese philosopher      who taught a return to nature. Nature and man were      harmonized in the Chinese garden. The garden was symbolic      of nature, while the house was reserved for man. That is,      where the house served man's practical and serious needs,      the garden was a place for the playful, romantic and      carefree side of man. In the house man is in the society of      his fellow beings, but in a garden he is in the society of      natural forms.    </p>    <p>      It has been said that inside the house the Chinese      gentleman is a Confucian-adhering strictly to the      conventions and moral codes set down by Confucius. But in      the garden he is a Taoist-following the      primitivistic, libertarian precepts of Lao Tze. It is      interesting to note that while the Chinese house is orderly      and formal in style, thus limiting the spirit, the garden      forms are irregular and sinuous, and so give the spirit      release. According to Wing-Tait Chan, the Chinese garden is      a "place where man laughs, sings, picks flowers, chases      butterflies and pets birds, makes love with maidens, and      plays with children. Here he spontaneously reveals his      nature, the base as well as the noble. Here also he buries      his sorrows and difficulties and cherishes his ideals and      hopes. It is in the garden that men discover themselves.      Indeed one discovers not only his real self but also his      ideal self-he returns to his youth. Inevitably the      garden is made the scene of man's merriment, escapades,      romantic abandonment, spiritual awakening or the perfection      of his finer self."    </p>    <p>      In Western gardens we seek more of the comforts or      conveniences which people have come to consider essential      to their well being. Another factor is garden beauty; we      arouse interest through variety of planting, excitement      through planting sequence, stimulation through planting      color. In any case, it is the <em>activity of people</em>      which determines the form and character of garden planting.    </p>    <p>      Modern landscape designers employ hundreds of devices in a      so-called "bag of tricks" to satisfy modern-day      beauty-and-comfort requirements. For instance, a shrub can      be planted to create a dozen different effects, depending      upon its placement and relation to human scale; if the      plant is above eye level it can function as protective      enclosur. if it is kept to chest-height, the effect is more      of spatial division; if the planting is waist-high, it      functions as a traffic control element; knee-height gives a      directional aspect to the planting. It is the      <em>human</em> scale-in the event, the person's      height-which relates and measures the garden      elements, fences and trees as well as shrubs. And the human      line vision determines whether these landscape elements      will provide privacy, separation or direction.    </p>    <p>      Eckbo is surely the most noted representative of the modern      landscape movement. His book, <em>Landscape and      Living,</em> is a clear statement and concise presentation      of modern landscape objectives and practice: Eckbo-gardens      are beautiful designs of plant-structure relationships, and      contain all the amenities so eagerly sought by up-to-date      home owners. In all of his gardens you will find the plant      and structural elements well selected. Also, the      groupings-forms and masses of plant      elements-are well arranged. Furthermore, the whole      scheme is very practical from maintenance point of      view.<br />    </p>    <p>      But minimum maintenance with maximum charm and "out-door      living" is not, in my book of planting-design, quite      enough. Modern landscape designers miss the boat entirely      as far as designing for spiritual "uplift" is concerned.      Where can one find a garden (this side of the Orient) which      gives man essential revitalizing contact with the plan      growth and fecundity of the earth? The Chinese captured      this essence in their garden plans, and themselves gained      strength and inspiration in the garden space. And I find      very few modern garden-designers with any concept of      <em>Spieltrieb-</em> the playful instincts expressed      in plant forms and garden structure. The idea that a garden      can be a home of gaiety, of imagination, of      fantasy-as well as a place for meditation and      repose-seems alien to modern thought on the subject.    </p>    <p>      I have great respect for one architect, however, who has      successfully expressed the Spieltrieb concept in a garden      plan for a modern Italian muralist. Bernard Rodofsky speaks      of his design in these terms:    </p>    <p>      A free-standing wall, plain and simple, with no special      task assigned, today is unheard of. In a garden, such a      wall assumes the character of sculpture. Moreover, if it is      of the utmost precision and of a brilliant whiteness, it      clashes-as it should-with the natural forms of      the vegetation, and engenders a gratuitous and continuously      changing spectacle of shadows and reflections. And aside      from serving as the protection screen for the surrounding      plants, the wall creates a sense of order. Three abstract      murals compete with the umbrageous phantasmagories.    </p>    <p>      An old apple tree pierces one of the walls, lending it      (methinks) a peculiar monumental quality. The pergola is      reduced to almost linear design, and does not intend to      more than assist and coordinate. A wisteria has taken      possession of it in the space of a few months; bamboo      shades are hung from it in summer. The wiry appearance of      the poles is accentuated by bright colors. The solarium is      an ample room with immaculately white walls, a floor of red      brick set in sand and a diminutive lawn. Wall openings were      omitted to avoid drafts; the solarium is accessible by      stairs only.    </p>        <p>      Another exceptional landscape architect, Roberto Butte      Marx, expresses the Spieltrieb element in bold and positive      terms. His designs are curving <em>freeform</em> reactions      against symmetry and rectangularity. One of the more      interesting things about Burle Marx's gardens is his      attractive use of native plants-plants considered to      be mere weeds among other gardeners. He searches his native      (Brazil) jungles for indigenous plants and combines their      placement with a skillful use of stone mosaic and      waterpools.    </p>    <p>      The central purpose of this chapter is to offer the      home-builder a working outline for landscaping his new      home. For many years I have been collecting data which can      be used as a basis for good planting-design procedure. My      approach has not been along "modernistic" landscaping      lines-nor have I tried to analyze the even more      subjective and symbolic forms of traditional Chinese and      Japanese gardens. Rather, I have attempted to organize a      planting-design procedure which is based entirely on the      ecology of natural vegetation; the relationship, that is,      between plants, climate and soil as well as between one      type of plant and another. My theory is that, once this      harmony is created, the garden-beauty and comfort-producing      factors for man's garden enjoyment will be automatically      forthcoming. Then whatever else happens in the garden      landscape-in terms of the Spieltrieb element, for      instance-will be entirely up to the home-owner, his      personality and likes and dislikes. I would hope that this      latter aspect, too, will be automatically      forthcoming-once the landscape retains natural      balance.    </p>    <p>      Rudolf Geiger is one of the earliest climatologists to      indicate what direction this "new" planting-design might      take. His excellent study on the microclimate also      indicates procedure and method for achieving this new      garden form. He found, for instance, that a mixed forest      growth of spruce, poplar and oak effectively cuts off from      the ground 70% of the sun's heat. Forests are cooler than      cleared land in summer, and warmer than cleared land in      winter. Nature keeps the ground covered with vegetation.      With this heat-absorbing surface, heat previously held by      the soil is transferred to the top layer of plant foliage.      This layer-to-layer transfer and exchange from a dead to a      living thermal-absorbing surface provides definite      summer-cooling and winter-warming effects. An evergreen      windbreak is also effective in reducing heat loss from      buildings-by keeping the cold winds out of contact      with building surfaces. Drifting snow is discouraged by      well-planned evergreen hedges.    </p>    <p>      The more significant function of natural vegetation is      demonstrated in summer time. No doubt everyone is aware of      the important summer-shading effect of trees (although the      barren tract-developments sometimes leave one to wonder how      this most basic of all climate-control features could be      missed by so many builders). But even a good understanding      of how the deciduous tree provides generous shade at      exactly the appropriate summer season-and then loses      its leaves toward autumn so the sun can easily penetrate      through the leafless branches during winter-is really      not enough information to assist the amateur home-builder      in his selection and placement of trees. Climate-control      experts employ a Heliodon-an accurate, simulated sun      machine-to determine the exact, most desirable      position of vegetation around buildings. The Olgyay      brothers, professors of architecture at Princeton      University, have published more vital information on this      subject than the rest of the climate-control research      agencies combined.    </p>    <p>      The shape and character of the shade tree will determine      the extent and shape of its shadow. The variety chosen      should therefore depend upon the shape of the area to be      shaded. For instance, the maple and ash produce circular      shadows, with an ascending branch pattern in winter. Honey      locust and tulip trees have oblong shapes. The white oak is      wide and horizontally oblong, with an open-branched      structure. The Lombardy poplar is columnar and the American      elm is vase-shaped in appearance. Other trees especially      recommended for shade purposes are; weeping willow, Russian      olive, flowering dogwood, sweet gum, American beech, maple,      white birch, and Siberian crab apple.    </p>    <p>      The effect that plants have on the heat and moisture      content of the soil and air is little recognized among      modern landscape gardeners. The usual mistake made is in      planting shrubs too close to the house. This may make an      attractive "design"; but the density of the shrubs has a      tendency to prevent breezes from penetrating, which in turn      reduces evaporative cooling and causes high humidity and      high temperatures to persist within the foliage of this      type of vegetation. Trees and grass near the house, on the      other hand, allow the heavier, cool air to flow inside      (providing the window openings are adequately designed, a      subject reserved for the following chapter). Leaves and      grass naturally absorb solar radiation and the resulting      evaporation cools the surrounding air. Mowed turf is an      especially good climate-control planting, as in shading the      soil it prevents heat absorption by it, thereby eliminating      intensive re-radiation.    </p>        <p>      Dr. Robert Deering, University of California professor of      agriculture, reports that when trees are planted near the      south glass wall of a building several desirable effects      occur. The north side of the tree, facing the south wall of      the building, is the "chilling" side of the tree, which      results in a cooling effect in the house. Annoying glare      can also be substantially reduced by so orienting the tree      placement. Air-borne sounds can be effectively reduced by      densely planted trees and shrubs. The viscous surfaces of      leaves catch dust, thereby functioning as excellent      air-filters.    </p>    <p>      In Europe, vines are used for controlling evaporation and      providing shade much more than in this country. Vines are      especially desirable when grown against or near the west      wall of a house. Recommended are; clematis, bittersweet,      frost grape, parthenocissus, hydrangea petiolaris,      wisteria, silver lace vine, Chinese fleece vine, Dutchman's      pipe, forsythia, ipomoea.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the latest, least understood concept of landscape      design has to do with the selection and arrangement of      plant material on the basis of color-fragrance      relationships. Florence Robinson's book on this subject      proved to be of some assistance. Eckbo made many      significant comments on this aspect of planting design. In      areas of high humidity, the darker, heavier and glossier      greens are prominent. However, this tends to accentuate the      oppressive, discomforting climate of high-humidity regions.      Therefore it is better, from a climate-control point of      view, to encourage the lighter, clearer greens. Thinner      plant forms should be grown in cool areas, and where the      atmosphere is dull and dark there is advantage in going to      silver and gold variegations.    </p>    <p>      In hot-dry zones of low humidity, the natural vegetation is      dull and fuzzy. The landscape quality is thinner; and      grays, gay-greens and brown-greens predominate. But, in      this type of climatic region, it is best to promote the      growth of darker, brighter, glossier or clearer greens. The      larger and richer foilage feels cool and moist-a most      desirable feature for use in arid regions.    </p>    <p>      An enlightened approach toward planting-design demands,      first of all, a thorough understanding of one's region and      site. This basic understanding, which includes information      about weather, soil and native plant life, must necessarily      precede an intelligent treatment of climate-control      procedures. For, after all, the primary objective in      planting-design relates to the creation of a satisfying      environment-climate-wise as well as in esthetic      content.    </p>    <p>      A whole chapter on this subject of climate-control can      therefore be profitably included in this book. We must dig      deep through the mire of information and misinformation and      arrive at some basic principles. Those principles will      ultimately lead us to rational planning of our home in its      natural environment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of      importance) <em><br />      Landscape for Living:</em> Garnett Eckbo <em><br />      Solar Control and Shading Devices:</em> A. & V.

Unfortunately, the revolt preceded the research needed to      start establishing these functions."    </p>    <p>      Architects Journal, 1965    </p>    <p>      In this multi-volumed and progressively-written book I have      attempted to present the results of my research precisely      along the lines of the functional revolt-as applied      to the low-cost or owner-built home. In the course of my      thinking and writing, I have been guided somewhat by      readers' comments and questions on previous chapters. These      have constituted a kind of feed-back on my researches. What      were the readers' particular problem areas? Such      considerations should assist in the formation of new      chapters or supplements-even new volumes or books.    </p>    <p>      The present chapter is a definite response to readers'      comments. More readers picked up an offhand mention of the      squat-toilet (p. 38) than any other item in Volume III. So      the squat-toilet idea will be discussed here. And it will      be discussed in its proper context as a feature of the      large problem of <em>bathroom waste disposal.</em> A proper      toilet suggests a proper disposal system and this further      suggests a proper structure to accommodate the necessary      facilities.    </p>    <p>      And by "proper" I refer, as usual, to Ralph Borsodi's      criteria: Is it healthful? Is it economical? Is it pleasing      to behold? One need not be reminded that modern bathroom      systems are ugly, expensive and unhealthful. If you wish to      know how much your conventional bathroom plumbing and      drainage system costs, count the number of fixtures in the      house, including lavatories, water closets, bathtub, water      heater. This total multiplied by $400 gives a close      estimate of plumbing costs. Add to this the room area      multiplied by $10 and you have a surprising total of about      $2500 for an average-size bathroom and drainage facility.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the "healthful" aspects must be considered. It can      be factually stated that the conventional water toilet is      not healthful. The high sitting position is artificial and      unhygienic. Nor is it healthful to pollute bodies of water      with water-borne sewage. Each year 4.5 million tons of      sewage sludge is dumped into the oceans from North America.      This represents 4.5 million tons of nitrite contaminant and      it also represents 4.5 million tons of potentially valuable      fertilizer <em>not</em> returned to the land. The experts      are in unanimous agreement on the subject of toilet height      (as quoted from Kira's book):    </p>    <p>      The ideal posture for defecation is the squatting position,      with the thighs flexed upon the abdomen. In this way the      capacity of the abdominal cavity is greatly diminished and      intra-abdominal pressure increased, thus encouraging the      expulsion of the fecal mass. The modern toilet seat in many      instances is too high even for some adults. The practice of      having young children use adult toilet seats is to be      deplored. Beckus, <em>Gastro-Enterology,</em> p <em>.</em>      511.    </p>    <p>      Man's natural attitude during defecation is a squatting      one, such as may be observed amongst field workers or      natives. Fashion, in the guise of the ordinary water      closet, forbids the emptying of the lower bowel in the way      Nature intended . . . It is no overstatement to say that      the adoption of the squatting attitude would in itself help      in no small measure to remedy the greatest physical vice of      the white race, the constipation that has become a      contentment. Hornibrook, <em>The Culture of the      Abdomen,</em> p <em>.</em> 75.    </p>    <p>      It should be mentioned in this connection that a very      common cause for unsatisfactory results . . . is improper      height of the toilet seat. It is usually too high. An ideal      seat would place the body in the position naturally assumed      by man in primitive conditions. The seat should be low      enough to bring the knees above the seat level. Williams,      <em>Personal Hygiene Applied,</em> p. 374.    </p>    <p>      The high toilet seat may prevent complete evacuation. The      natural position for defecation, assumed by primitive      races, is the squatting position . . . When the thighs are      pressed against the abdominal muscles in this position; the      pressure within the abdomen is greatly increased, so that      the rectum is more completely emptied. Our toilets are not      constructed according to physiological requirements. Aaron,      <em>Our Common</em> <em>Ailment</em> , p.66.    </p>    <p>      The Thailand government has had a long-established program      of improving rural latrines at Chiengnai. Perhaps the most      recent achievement in this area has been the development of      a water-seal squat-type (squatting plate) toilet bowl that      any farmer can build for less than a dollar's worth of      material. The Thailand Ministry of Health sells a      2-component cast aluminum master mold from which countless      numbers of units can be built. I secured a couple of these      Chiengnai molds for our owes experimentation-and to      loan out to people interested in building their own toilet      bowls.    </p>    <p>      The finished toilet bowl is quite satisfactory. It takes      about one quart of water to flush the unit-as opposed      to 4 gallons for the conventional water closets. The bowl      can be maintained clean and sanitary without difficulty.      And most important of all, the use of this bowl      necessitates a natural evacuation posture.    </p>    <p>      The use of a squatting plate suggests a re-evaluation and      redesign of the complete bathroom facility. The room I      propose is in effect a four-foot diameter shower stall. A      single flexible water inlet-of the type commonly used      in Denmark-supplies showering, lavatory washing and      bowl flushing. A single drain disposes of all wash and      flushing water through the bowl trap. (Ideally, a solar      water heater and storage facility directly overhead      supplies consistent warm water needs.) Directly below the      squatting plate an excreta-disposal compartment is      provided.    </p>    <p>      There are two basic methods of excreta disposal: The      compost privy and the septic tank. The first process is      <em>aerobic</em> and requires oxygen in its fermentation      process of decomposition. The second is <em>anaerobic</em>      and consists of a putrefactive breakdown-in places      where oxygen does not have access. We must choose between      fermentation and putrefaction in our attempt (1) to reclaim      the nutrient and fertilizer value of waste, and (2) to      dispose of excreta waste in a sanitary manner.    </p>    <p>      World Health Organization publications present a compelling      argument against handling excreta in an anaerobic (sewage      and septic tank) manner. As a result of not having oxygen      in a putrifactive action, no heat build-up occurs and      therefore certain pathogens and parasites are not fully      destroyed. It has been found that contaminated material in      liquid suspension (anaerobic digestion) can remain viable      for as long as six months. For one thing, there are far      more species of bacteria involved in aerobic decomposition      than in anaerobic putrification.    </p>    <p>      Other problems are associated with the disposal of      water-borne waste. Sewage necessarily containing large      quantities of water (necessary for the transport of the      excreta) is difficult to treat. Water does have a certain      ability for self-purification. But this requires oxidation      and usually the volume of water is too small in proportion      to sewage to supply the required quantity of oxygen.      Consequently the receiving water becomes foul and normal      fauna (especially fish which require oxygen to live) are      destroyed. The receiving water also becomes contaminated      with pathogenic bacteria, protozoa, and with the eggs and      larvae of harmful helminths (liver flukes).    </p>    <p>      Our society not only legalizes pollutive unsanitary      disposal methods, it also outlaws an improved      nutrition-an essential factor in prevention of      disease-which is obtained when excreta wastes are      returned to agricultural lands as plant nutrients.    </p>    <p>      The only really practical way to reclaim these wastes is      through aerobic composting. Pathogenic bacteria and worm      eggs can survive no longer than 30 minutes to 1 hour in a      compost situation. Compost temperatures rise to 160 degrees      F. High temperatures, however, are only partly responsible      for this bacteria destruction; competing bacterial flora      and predatory protozoa contribute as well. Aerobic      composting is achieved by a wide succession of bacterial      and fungal populations-each suited to its own      environment and its own relative duration: The activities      of one group compliment the other.    </p>    <p>      Humus is the end-product of properly composted organic      materials. Humus contributes to increased nitrogen-fixation      in the soil from nitrogen in the air. Also, as the gradual      decomposition of insoluble organic matter takes place,      nitrogen is liberated (as ammonia) and then oxidized to      nitrates. Plants can utilize this nitrogen only in the form      of nitrates. So when raw (not composted) wastes are spread      on the land-as is commonly done in the      Orient-nitrogen evaporates into the air instead of      being used by plants.    </p>    <p>      The primary key to good compost-building is to establish      correct proportioning and blending of the raw materials. In      essence the problem is one of determining carbon and      nitrogen ratios (C/N), along with the correct amount of      moisture and aeration. Cellulose organic matter like straw      or sawdust is rich in carbon, and excreta are rich in      nitrogen. It has been found desirable to keep the C/N ratio      above 30 to 1 when excreta is used; excreta should equal      10% to 25% of the total weight. Urine contains considerable      larger amounts of nitrogen than do feces. Raw garbage has a      C/N ratio of 25 to 1; sawdust, 511 to 1; farmyard manure;      14 to 1.    </p>    <p>      Aeration helps maintain the required high temperatures in      an aerobic composting condition. Turning the compost pile      at frequent intervals has been a traditional method of      achieving aeration. Yet, turning adversely effects nitrogen      conservation. Ammonia readily escapes to the atmosphere      when the material is disturbed and exposed.    </p>    <p>      As one becomes more familiar with the whole process of      aerobic composting, the design of an appropriate facility      falls into place. The facility design can be likened to      that of a furnace: Material (fuel) is placed in a      combustion chamber; a vent stack (chimney) is provided to      carry off gases that are produced from the decomposition      (methane, carbon-dioxide, ammonia); and, finally, a storage      compartment must be supplied for the end product (humus, or      ash, in the case of a furnace).    </p>    <p>      The size of the facility depends, of course, upon the      number of people using it. About 2 pounds of excreta per      person per day, or 1 1/2 cubic feet per person per year, is      used as a design figure.    </p>    <p>      If the initial C/N ratio is 30 to 1, it takes about 10 days      composting time; a 78 to 1 ratio takes 20 days. Using the 1      to 5 volume ratio of excreta to refuse, and figuring that a      family of five will produce about 1 cubic yard of partly      digested excreta in four years, a compartment size of 1      cubic yard would fill in about 9 months. It must be      remembered, however, that decomposition into gases and      soluble materials reduces volume and mass as much as 80%.    </p>    <p>      The Indian Council of Agricultural Research at Bangalore      developed extensive composting programs based on the      compost privy principle.    </p>    <p>      They built an experimental "double vault" latrine. During      the time that one compartment was being used, compost      material in the adjacent compartment was ripening. A period      of 6 months lapsed between clean-outs, This two-compartment      system appears to be superior to others. However by      incorporating a simple damper mechanism, only one squatting      plate need be provided.    </p>    <p>      Rikard Lindstrom of Tyreso, Sweden, has patented a simple      aerobic composting chamber. Its salient feature consists of      a sloping (16-degree) bottom to the tank, which provides      for a continual movement of the decomposed refuse to a      storage chamber as additional wastes are added to the other      compartment. The chamber bottom should contain a thick lays      (12-inches) of straw or sawdust so that urine will be      absorbed and reclaimed. This porous layer of cellulose also      provides aeration to the central section of the pile.      Lindstrom used a system of inverted U-shaped conduits and      ventilation holes to provide adequate aeration. Air      circulation is also accelerated through solar-heated flue      conversion.    </p>    <p>      In Japan, where excreta is traditionally used as a      fertilizer, powdered soybean is often added. Enzymes in the      soybean speed up the breakdown of organic solids. Kazuyoshi      Yamaji of Tokyo holds a U.S. patent on a "powdered      deodorizer of the acceleration of ripening of organic      fertilization fertilizers." A dried and powdered cereal      containing a large quantity of enzyme is first mixed with      rice-bran, barley-bran, or wheat-bran. Water is added and      it is heaped for fermentation. It is then dried and      powdered and mixed with tricalcium phosphate and the powder      of germinated seeds of cereal such as barley, wheat, bean,      etc. which contains a large quantity of enzyme. Only a      small quantity of the finished product need be sprinkled on      the excreta.    </p>        <p>      Bio-Dynamic gardeners use a special      preparation-inocula-in making compost humus.      The formula is based on the researches of the late Dr.      Rudolf Steiner. One of these exotic preparations (502) is      made from yarrow blossoms, fermented together with deer      bladders over a period of 6 months in earth during the      winter.    </p>    <p>      Using enzymes, hormones, or biocatalysts in the      decomposition of organic material and for nitrogen fixation      may prove to be an interesting sideline, but none of these      inocula are really necessary to a properly balanced compost      environment. Organic material contains all the growth      factors and vitamins necessary for normal development.      These growth factors are produced by micro-organisms in      sufficient quantities in a mixed microbial population to      meet normal growth requirements.    </p>    <p>      From the point of view of cost, health, and good design, I      recommend the cylinder-shaped structure. The 4-foot      diameter structure contains, in its series of levels:      Effluent drainage pit, compost chamber, bathroom facility,      solar water heater. A very simple slip-form jig can be      employed to build the solid concrete walls. The complete      unit is available from me for loan to interested people.      Floor and roof are cast-in-place concrete. Ideally the unit      would be built on a hillside to provide best access to the      compost compartment. It can be built as a detached      structure or connected to hall, breezeway or directly to      sleeping unit. The accompanying drawings and photos best      illustrate the structure and techniques of construction.    </p>        <p>      A widespread use of the compost privy is not to be      expected. There are many social, legal, and technical      difficulties associated with adopting this new functional      mode of handling human excreta. For clarification on      specific aspects, ask your friendly Building Inspector. In      my judgement the long term personal rewards and benefits to      the environment warrant whatever manner of subterfuge      deemed necessary to build the compost privy. No County      Building Department should have the power to prevent my      squatting to relieve myself, nor should it prevent compost      activities limited to my own garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (Books listed in order of      importance)<br />      <em>An Agricultural Testament;</em> Albert Howard      <em><br />      Excreta Disposal;</em> World Health Organization <em><br />      Composting;</em> World Health Organization <em><br />      The Bathroom;</em> Alexander Kira<br />      <em>Fertility From Town Wastes;</em> Wylie    </p>    <p>      MORE KEN KERN (THIS TIME "OWNER BUILT HOMESTEAD") COMING IN      MOTHER NO. 7.    </p>
