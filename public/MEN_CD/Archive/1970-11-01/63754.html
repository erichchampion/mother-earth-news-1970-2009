                    <h5 id="byline">by JAMES E. CHURCHILL</h5>        <p>      After an evening meal of fresh lake trout, cattail      biscuits, arrowhead vegetable and raspberry dessert, my son      and I took the canoe-leaving my wife and daughter to      their own pursuits-and crossed the 150 yards of      Ranger Lake that lay between our island and the mainland.      We were going to cruise quietly along the shore in hopes of      seeing a moose. If we were lucky we might even get a      picture.    </p>    <p>      Nearing a "bay"-which we found out later was a      creek-we heard some commotion in the thick aspen and      evergreens. Suddenly a white tail buck bolted straight up      the almost vertical hill that was the bank of Ranger Lake      at this point and we smiled at each other in delight at      seeing a familiar Wisconsin animal here in Canada. The      noise coming from the bush didn't stop, however. It wasn't      the deer that had made it. Paddling very softly forward we      could detect a crunching; chewing sound coming from the      base of a large aspen. Suddenly the tree dropped into the      lake with a tremendous splash and water shot high into the      air. We had witnessed a very rare sight: A tree actually      falling that a beaver had cut. This more than made up for      us not seeing any moose on the entire trip.    </p>    <p>      We had arrived at the island on which we pitched our camp      by traveling through the Upper Peninsula of Michigan,      crossing the International Bridge at Sault St. Marie and      driving our small, low clearance auto right up to the lake      via Ranger Lake road.    </p>    <p>      Now, the Ranger Lake road may not be the best highway in      the world, but it was surely one of the better wild plant      foraging trails early this fall. There was acre after acre      of large sweet blueberries, patch after patch of      raspberries, huge sweet-tasting dew berries and many      choke-cherry trees with the largest choke cherries I had      ever seen. Cattails grew in hundreds of pot-holes along the      road, arrowhead root was abundant, white pond lilies were      everywhere and though we didn't fish them, many trout      streams tumbled through the hills and gorges of the route.    </p>    <p>      We stopped a couple times on the way in and filled our pans      with berries against the possibility that they would be      scarce where we planned to camp. At Ranger Lake itself I      noticed dandelions, thistle and plantain right in the      campground but didn't pick any. We were too anxious to get      to the island.    </p>    <p>      A mountain of sleeping bags, tents, cameras, pots, pans and      clothes was swiftly loaded into the canoe . . . but not so      swiftly that I didn't notice the small smoke houses that      are located at almost every permanent dwelling on Ranger      Lake. I found out how they're made and used and I'll try to      include the plans in another issue.    </p>    <p>      We launched our canoe from the Garden River campgrounds      and, about eight miles north, stopped for a shore lunch. I      made a semi-circle through the bush of the gravel bar where      we were eating and found raspberries, the inevitable      blueberries and a pin cherry tree. After lunch we continued      on toward our planned destination: The junction of Ranger      Lake and Saymo Lake, where our map showed a small island.    </p>    <p>      The vastness of this country keeps the uninitiated looking      at the changing blues of the water, the towering greenness      of the hills and the pink rock formations. Several times I      had to speak to Jim, my son, to keep him from forgetting to      stroke the bow paddle and our eight-year-old daughter kept      up a solid commentary of "look at this" and "how did that      happen" until my wife had to shush her.    </p>    <p>      In the back of my mind I envied the natives of this great      territory with their possible diet of moose steaks, lake      trout fillets and mountains of wild berries. I really      wouldn't care if I got lost up here . . . for the summer at      least. I did notice that it had dropped to 72° below      zero one winter at a town nearby, though, so careful      preparation would be in order for that season.    </p>    <p>      The next day we left our camp behind, canoed to the head of      Ranger Lake and crossed on the portage to Saymo Lake. There      is a fly-in or boat-in lodge there although we didn't see      anyone around. An old wooden dam is located at the junction      of the two lakes and it appears to have burned sometime in      the past. Portaging was a welcome break after the paddling      and, while the family stretched out on the bank, I took a      walk through the adjoining bush. Here I saw blueberries,      raspberries, choke cherries, pin cherries and dandelions.    </p>    <p>      A large brown mink kept coming from the jumble of timbers      around the dam and staring at us as we left. He didn't      appear to be afraid, which is unusual for a wild mink, and      we didn't try to get too close as the possibilities of      rabies always exists in animals. Paddling north on Saymo we      saw a large island jutting up from the lake. On the      southern shore of this island was a small, red log cabin.      The lonely, washed place of beauty was deserted and we felt      sad that the owner had left . . . for whatever reason.    </p>    <p>      We paddled around to the north side of the island and      decided, then and there, to forage our lunch. While my wife      and Jolain picked blueberries and Jim fished, I walked in      from the beach for the rest of the meal. There was plenty      of dandelion and plantain, more berries and cherries and,      if I had been really hungry, there was a plentiful supply      of poplar trees whose inner bark makes a vitamin-filled      survival food. I had instructions from my wife to bring      back just a wild green and a vegetable, however. That was      going to be easy.    </p>    <p>      I quickly picked my fishing vest pockets full of      plantain-selecting only the small, inner, perfect      leaves-for the greens and when I broke through the      dense forest of the island to the other shore I walked      directly into a large patch of arrowhead. No better      vegetable exists if my palate is the authority.    </p>    <p>      One hurdle in gathering arrowhead is finding the      potato-like tubers in the mud and water from which they      grow. Here I was fortunate. The plants were about 1-1/2      feet of water and the layer of mud underneath was      thin.    </p>    <p>      Borrowing a method from the Indian squaws old, I took my      shoes and socks off and waded into the patch barefoot. It      was great fun squishing around in the cool mud for the      tubers with both hands and both feet. I could feel the      tubers in the mud and I tried to pull them loose without      disturbing any plants. Even though this particular      arrowhead patch was the very thin-leafed variety with small      tube harvested enough for a meal in a very short time    </p>    <p>      A point or two of interest about this plant: A general      rule, the larger the arrowhead the larger tuber growing      underneath. Not all plants of family have arrowhead shaped      leaves, either. The leaves are elliptical on some varieties      and tongue-like on others and such plants have very small      tubers.    </p>    <p>      When I returned to camp the ladies had blueberries and      raspberries crushed together and sprinkled with sugar. If      we had been home or had an oven available, my wife would      have made blueberry pie to the following specifications.    </p>    <p>      To four cups fresh berries add 2/3 cup sugar, four      tablespoons flour, two teaspoons quick cooking tapioca,      1-1/2 tablespoons lemon juice, 1/2 teaspoon cinnamon. Stir      gently until well blended. Pour in pie crust, "dot" or      distribute one tablespoon butter over blended berries. Let      stand for 15 minutes. Cover with top crust and bake in      450° oven for ten minutes. Reduce heat to 350° and      bake until crust is golden . . . about 40 minutes total      baking time. This same recipe will make raspberry pie with      the sugar increased to one cup.    </p>    <p>      Jim, the invincible fisherman, had caught a dandy lake      trout on a Flashing Spoon. I had the vegetables and the      girls had found dessert. In less than an hour we had      foraged a good meal from this heavily forested island in      the remote wilds of Canada.    </p>            <p>      I turned my attention to the arrowhead tubers first, filled      a four quart pan partly full of lake water and gave them a      good scrubbing. I used my knife, then, to scrape away the      purple and loose skin. When this was done I washed the      nodules thoroughly, covered them with water and sat the pan      on the coals of the campfire. After it had boiled five      minutes I drained this water and added a second. This was      to eliminate the slightly sharp, bitter taste common to      arrowhead. The pan went back on the coals to boil another      two minutes, salt and pepper was added      and-finally-the tubers were boiled three      minutes more.    </p>        <p>      We sliced them then and dropped the slices in a pan of      sputtering bacon grease my wife had ready. When they turned      a golden brown we dipped the tubers onto the tin pie plates      that we use for dishes when we are camping.    </p>    <p>      Another way I cook arrowhead is to peel and slice 1/2 cup      of tuber, add 1/4 cup chopped wild onions and one cup of      any meat or fish on hand. Boil vigorously for ten minutes,      salt and pepper and let simmer for about one hour. This      will serve one person in from the fields. Proportionally      larger amounts will serve more.    </p>    <p>      Arrowhead tubers are pretty good raw also and they make a      satisfying substitute for new potatoes in recipes such as      this:    </p>    <p>      To make creamed tubers and milkweed pods, slice and peel      the tubers and boil them until tender, changing the water      once. Prepare an equal amount of milkweed pods by methods      outlined in <em>"Food Without Farming", MOTHER NO. 3.      Now</em> pour the water off the tubers, add one tablespoon      butter, salt and cover with milk. Add the milkweed pods.      Make a thickening of one tablespoon flour and enough water      for a smooth paste. Stir the thickening into the milk and      vegetables. Simmer until well cooked. Serve hot.    </p>    <p>      I had covered the plantain with cold water to soak clean      while I worked on the arrowhead tubers. I now changed the      water and swished the plantain around in a pan to clean it      very well. Plantain always seems gritty to me if it's not      soaked before cooking . . . but perhaps that's just a      notion.    </p>    <p>      I started the water, boiled the plantain for about ten      minutes, drained it and added a tablespoon of butter to the      pint of greens. The butter was stirred in and salt and      pepper added. The greens were ready.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, Jim had cleaned the trout he caught and my      wife had rolled the fillets in corn meal and fried them a      beautiful brown. The meal was ready and we ate.    </p>    <p>      Whale we were enjoying our lunch a raft of poplar branches      floated by, going directly upwind. It was a beaver floating      dinner across the lake to his lodge. Foraging is good for      everything in this wild country.    </p>
