        <p>When the cold winter winds blew and the snow was drifted up to the woodshed eaves, great grandma used a crystal garden to keep her brood occupied through a long evening or two. You can do the same. All you'll need is some household ammonia, liquid bluing, food coloring, non-iodized table salt, water, a six-inch dish and a brick or couple of lumps of soft coal.</p><p>Cover the brick or coal (so the pieces won't fly up) and wallop it into walnut-sized lumps with a hammer. Arrange the chunks in the center of the dish.</p><p>Now mix - in this order - four tablespoons of plain <em>(not</em> iodized) salt, four tablespoons liquid bluing, four tablespoons water and one tablespoon of ammonia. <em>CAUTION:</em><em>Ammonia can be harmful and children should use it only with adult supervision.</em></p><p>Stir the mixture until the salt dissolves and pour it over the lumps of brick or coal. Then, with an eyedropper, drip spots of food coloring onto the wet chunks.</p><p>That's it. In a few hours, your garden of spider-webby, cauliflower-like crystals will spring up in tints and shades of the coloring you used. Handle the dish gently and the fragile growths can delight you for weeks.</p>
