        <p>On the facing page you'll see a drawing and schematic of the bio-gas plant designed by Ram Bux Singh for THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>. A few photographs of the digester under construction are on this page. And how does it work?</p><p>Well, sad to say, it doesn't work at all . . . yet.</p><p>No, there's nothing wrong with Ram Bux Singh's design. What happened was that the guy who told us what a great welder he was and who did most of the welding on the blamed thing (we will mercifully refrain from bandying his name around) really screwed up the water jacket on our methane plant. The jacket leaks like the proverbial sieve and we can't fix it now without taking the whole blamed bio-gas plant apart.</p><p>Which we're gonna do . . . in the spring. Till then, hang on. At least we know that a digester really works, and that's all this plant had to prove anyway. We've already got several ideas for a new, improved model and-along about next summer-we should have some great plans and maybe even a prefabbed bio-gas plant to show you!</p>

The insulation is not shown in this drawing, however, so that the tanks may be more fully illustrated.
