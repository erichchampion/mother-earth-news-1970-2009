Back in 1948 he began        collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural        construction materials and techniques. He combed the        world for ideas, tried them and started writing about his        experiments.      </p>      <p>        Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's        articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN        REVOLUTION. Ken has also issued a three-year series of        pieces (called TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun        pit design of his has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.      </p>      <p>        This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from        OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT        HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters        of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my        presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I        apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available        right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,        California 93644 for $10.00.      </p>      <p>        - MOTHER      </p>    </div>    <p>      <em>Trees</em> <em>full of soft foliage; blossoms fresh      with spring beauty; and, finally-fruit, rich,      bloom-dusted, melting, and luscious-such are the      treasures of the orchard and the garden, temptingly offered      to every landholder in this bright and sunny, though      temperate climate.</em> <em>A.J. Downing 1845</em> Whenever      the subject of Homestead Orchard is discussed, two things      flash to mind: First, I am reminded of the many      agricultural Titans who have devoted major segments of      their lives to the furtherance of tree crops.<br />      <br />      There are hard-working devotees in every field of plant and      animal husbandry . . . but pomologists appear somewhat      different. They seem to be a more dedicated and intense      breed . . . to them tree crops offer philosophical      substance as well as taste and nutrition. Professor John      Gifford was one of these Titans who saw social and economic      implications in tree crops. In 1934 he wrote a small book      on diversified tree crop farming for the tropical      homestead.<br />      <br />      In it he showed how annual crops are unsuitable to tropical      climates, where deep-rooted trees thrive. The Mayans failed      to survive because they planted corn and cut down forests.      For the most part tree-men consider corn the killer of      continents, and regard corn as one of the worst enemies of      the human future. Annuals are the crop of primitive man . .      . food needed in a hurry, Promethean man supposedly has the      culture and the leisure and intelligence to subsist on tree      crops! This is my favorite passage from Gifford's      book:<br />      <br />      <em>The furtherance of the tropical forest subsistence      homestead has been and 1 hope always will be uppermost in      my mind. For 40 years my life has been shaping itself to      this very end because it seems to me about the most      essential thing that can give life and comfort to the      majority of our people, in fact, the only permanent way out      of the difficulties which beset the world.<br />      <br />      The small farm home is the essential basic unit of society.      The prosperity and strength of any country can be measured      by the number of small self-supporting homesteads which it      contains. The best nations of the world are not those with      the greatest natural resources but with the largest number      of small, self-supportive, free-of-debt homesites.<br />      <br /></em> THE TROPICAL SUBSISTENCE HOMESTEAD. The second      thing that comes to mind in a tree crop discussion is      disheartening: A tremendous knowledge of tree crops has      been amassed by many at great cost in time and energy . . .      but is virtually unknown or unaccepted by contemporary      farmers. There is no better example of this unfortunate      situation than exists in a review of the life work of J.      Russell Smith, tree-man par excellence. Smith launched his      study of commercially useless trees in 1910, with a      worldwide quest for new varieties. In 1929 he published      <em>TREE CROPS-A PERMANENT AGRICULTURE.</em><br />      <br />      His valuable tree discoveries were then intensified with      more worldwide travel followed by a revised edition of his      book in 1954. As a loyal tree-man, Smith (who, incidentally      was professor of economic geography at Columbia University)      spoke vehemently against annual row crops. Crops that must      build themselves from scratch for each harvest are victims      of the climatic uncertainty of short seasons. Tree crops,      on the other hand, are not affected by drought to the same      degree . . . deep roots enable a tree to accumulate and      store moisture. Smith was repulsed by the fact that      four-fifths of everything raised by the American farmer      goes to feed animals.<br />      <br />      He made a good case for a tree crop diet instead, realizing      that meat contains 800 calories as compared to nuts which      contain 3,200 calories. If animals are to be raised, Smith      maintained that they should be allowed to harvest their own      crops. This "hogging down" principle is nowadays a major      agricultural innovation . . . as when hogs are permitted to      harvest corn, soybeans, peanuts, etc. Smith maintained that      tree crops can also be harvested directly by animals . . .      mulberry, persimmon, oak, chestnut, honey locust, and carob      are all excellent stock-food trees. Andrew Jackson Downing      continues to be the tree-crop giant of them all.<br />      <br />      One of his major works, <em>FRUITS AND FRUIT TREES OF      AMERICA,</em> published in 1845, remains today an essential      tree crop reference. Resulting from the publication of a      number of his important books, Downing's influence on      American fruit tree culture is apparent to this day. He      fully remodeled western European fruit growing practices to      fit American site and climatic conditions. One contemporary      tree crop author found that fruit trees planted in      Massachusetts and Michigan during the height of Downing's      influence (18701890) are still standing and bearing fruit.      Yet thousands of trees planted in subsequent years      (1890-1920) have broken down or died. There is a refreshing      simplicity in Downing's basic principles:<br />      <br />      <em>A judicious pruning to modify the form of our standard      trees is</em> <em>nearly all that is required in ordinary      practice. Every fruit tree, grown in the open orchard or      garden as a common standard, should be</em> <em>allowed to      take its natural form, the whole efforts of the pruner      going no further than to take out all weak and crowded      branches.</em><br />      <br />      The tree-men who have qualified the science of pomology are      in unanimous agreement on one important aspect:      <em>interplanting</em> is a desirable practice.<br />      <br />      Interplanting makes good sense to the homesteader from a      purely economic standpoint. Where peaches, pears and plums      are interplanted in apple orchards, revenue from their      yields subsidize the apples to production. Rapidly maturing      'tree crops (like dwarfed varieties) can be alternated with      slowly maturing species. Mulberry trees are an excellent      choice to interplant in a nut tree orchard . . . they grow      rapidly, bear young and are resistant to shade. One type of      interplanting is known as "two-story agriculture". Here,      trees are grown on land that is cropped or pastured for      mutual benefit.<br />      <br />      There has already been some discussion (see MOTHER N0. 17)      of how sod crops benefit by the companionship of tree      crops. About 10 black walnut trees in an acre of permanent      pasture improves the pasture considerably.<br />      <br />      The deep roots and thin open foliage characteristic of      walnut trees do not interfere with a lower-story sod crop.      The leaf-filtered, sunlight makes it possible for a sod      crop to continue growth throughout summer months. Walnut      trees give grass more time to get established before the      summer warm season, because their growth is primarily in      the late spring. There are numerous advantages in planting      a two-story fruit and vegetable garden.<br />      <br />      Fruit trees bear in the upper story while brambles, grapes,      bush fruit, or vegetables grow below. Long-lived fruit      trees continue to bear when short-lived lower-story plants      are removed. "Filler" trees are located between standard      varieties, to provide early bearing an short-lived fruit.      Dwarfed trees can be used as fillers in a standard bearing      orchard.<br />      <br />      They can be chosen as early bearing varieties of the same      fruit, as when a wealthy apple is set between a northern      spy or McIntosh apple.    </p>        <p>      In terms of intensive gardening, planting trees in "square"      patterns is wasteful of space. When a tree is planted in      the <em>center</em> of each square (creating a quincunx      arrangement), nearly twice as many trees can be located in      the same area.<br />      <br />      The gardening program for an intensively planted, heavily      mulched 60 by 50-foot plot might be as follows: Vegetables      and ever-bearing strawberries harvested the first season, a      partial crop of brambleberries harvested from the second to      tenth year, and then removed; from the third to the tenth      year dwarfed fruit varieties bear, then removed to allow      more room for semi-permanent trees; peaches and plums      produce until the fifteenth year,<br />      <br />      then removed to allow maximum space for the remaining four      apples and pear-with appropiate sod crop-which      continue to bear indefinitely.<br />      <br />      There are a number of conditions that influence the choice      of a sod crop in an orchard. The ideal sod crop is one      which grows slowly at first, when trees need the ground      moisture, and more rapidly later in the season when trees      require less moisture. Soybeans and cowpeas have this      quality. Alfalfa and small grains are poor choices because      their extensive root systems may rob the tree of      moisture.<br />      <br />      Leguminous sod crops-such as hairy vetch-are      especially valuable for maintaining soil fertility in a nut      tree orchard. Tree crops planted in a heavy and poorly      drained soil will benefit from a lower-story permanent sod      crop such as bluegrass or orchard grass <em>(orchard</em>      grass is aptly named!).<br />      <br />      Grass roots help to use up soil moisture and increase the      size of air-filled pores and fractures. Aeration is thus      improved, and if cultivation can be avoided, the tree's      surface root growth will be encouraged at the one place      where aeration is best attained . . . the surface. Plowing,      discing, rototilling, and cultivating around trees is a      ghastly practice, to be avoided at all costs: A homesteader      should realize that the greater majority of all feeder      roots are located within one foot of the surface.<br />      <br />      This is the zone where the soil is most fertile and where      aeration is greatest. Mulch planting is a much preferred      practice.<br />      <br />      Besides nutrient and moisture conservation, mulch gives      excellent protection against winter root damage. Tests at      the University of Kansas show freezing soil penetration to      26 inches on bare ground; snow cover reduces this danger      area to 12 inches; straw mulch plus the snow coverage      reduces it even more . . . to 6 inches. A mulch cover tends      to retard spring blossoming . .<br />      <br />      . which can be a desirable feature in areas where late      frosts present a danger (as in eastern Oregon, where it may      freeze <em>any time</em> during the growing season).      Another protection against early blossoming is to plant on      the north slope. The accompanying diagram illustrates how      this retardation principle operates.<br />      <br />      Some tree crops, like apricot, plum, sweet cherry, and      almond naturally blossom early; some apple varieties like      Rome beauty and northern spy blossom late.<br />      <br />      As a general rule the blossoming of fruit begins early in      the south and moves north at about five days for each      degree of latitude. Altitude will influence these figures      somewhat.    </p>    <p>      Charts showing "average date of last killing frost" should      not be entirely adhered to, because <em>average</em> means      that 50% of the frost occurs before and 50% after the      specified date.<br />      <br />      The odds are just too great to follow. An injurious winter      temperature can also be influenced by a water-tempering      effect. There is more danger of winter injury to tree crops      in the Mississippi Valley (latitude 38 degrees)<br />      <br />      than in Nova Scotia (latitude 45 degrees). An orchard      planted on the leeward shore (usually south or east) of      water gains significant temperature advantage. This      assumes, of course, that the water remains unfrozen .<br />      <br />      . . no protection is offered from frozen water.      Water-filled soil supplies more latent heat on a frosty      night than dry soil. An ideal tree crop site is one that      lies higher than surrounding land. Trees planted in a      natural draw receive cold air drainage.<br />      <br />      Even on a gradual slope, when cold air drainage meets a      tree crop obstacle, it may engulf it and cause frost      damage. Air drainage can be facilitated by correct planting      practice, as accompanying sketches depict.<br />      <br />      Trees planted on the contour or in rows across a slope may      also impede essential air drainage. Wind protection is an      essential consideration in any homestead tree crop program.      A following chapter will give ample consideration to      windbreak planning.<br />      <br />      Mainly, the fact that winds are usually accompanied by      heavy ground-saturating rains make trees vulnerable to      toppling over.<br />      <br />      There are various reasons for choosing dwarf varieties of      fruit trees in preference to standard varieties. For one      thing, site and climate problems can be tolerated better      with dwarf varieties.<br />      <br />      The ground-hugging feature of closely planted dwarf trees      permits them to receive more warming radiation from ground      heat. There is a type of "creeper" dwarf apple tree that      grows as far north as Siberia.<br />      <br />      Having little height it can stand the cold better and be      protected in the wintertime by a snow cover. Other      considerations for tree choice besides site and climate      should be mentioned: <em>hardiness</em> is certainly one. A      tree that is hardy in its environ ment is certainly more      resistant to disease.<br />      <br />      In California, for instance, English walnut trees are      customarily gafted onto black walnut root stock. As a      result of long years of experience it was found that black      walnut roots are less susceptible to fungus attack and      survive California temperature extremes better.<br />      <br />      Rootstock grafting is also done to attain a deeper root      system . . . a valuable consideration in areas of limited      irrigation or rainfall.    </p>        <p>      Proper tree choice is also essential in moisture-scarce      regions. Cherries, gapes and olives require less moisture      than oranges, apples and pears.<br />      <br />      In Tunisia, olive trees are planted as much as 100 feet      apart in order to gain the extra moisture advantage that      comes with increased spacing. Commercial, monoculture      orchards are invariably overcrowded, overtilled,      overfertilized, overpruned, and of course,      overdiseased.<br />      <br />      But to be commercially "economic" a money-based orchard      could hardly be operated otherwise! Tree crop food      production is one area where a homesteader can maintain      major advantages over the commercial farmer. The      homesteader can engage in all the "uneconomic" practices,      like two-story, intercropped, mulch-planted varieties, and      produce better tasting, nutritious, disease-free      crops.<br />      <br />      To remain competitive, a commercial orchardist must      stimulate large-and-early, colorful crops. Of the numerous      shot-in-the-arm methods for attaining these ends,      <em>fertilization</em> is probably the most used . . . and      misused. Darwin was one of the first to point out the      dangers of fertilization.<br />      <br />      In his <em>VARIATIONS OF ANIMALS AND PLANTS UNDER      DOMESTICA</em> TION he quotes Gartner in the statement that      sterility from soil fertilization is especially common with      cereals, cabbage, peas and beans. The concentration of      salts found in farmyard manure as well as chemical      fertilizer will<br />      <br />      <em>destroy</em> tender feeder roots. Many newly planted      trees die because the grower was too eager to "give the      tree a good start" by filling massive amounts of fertilizer      around the root zone. A mixture of damp peat moss and loamy      soil around newly planted roots would be better than      fertilizer in any form.<br />      <br />      Also, the planting hole should not be water-saturated as      the tree is planted. Moisten the soil <em>after</em> the      tree is planted, to prevent the formation of clods and to      facilitate tamping.<br />      <br />      Fall planting is considered best for tree crops. However,      where severe winters prevail, spring planting is      preferred.<br />      <br />      With a fall-planted tree, some root growth will take place      through the winter months if the tree is heavily mulched.      Be sure to direct the newly planted tree slightly into the      prevailing wind. This encourages root development on the      windward side, as the most vigorous branch always lies      directly over the most vigorous root.<br />      <br />      Dioecious trees-those having male and female organs      borne by different individuals-should be grown as;      one would raise a herd of animals . . . one male tree      (staminate) planted with a group of female trees      (pistillate). Commercial nurseries charge exorbitant prices      for grafted tree stock.<br />      <br />      Traffic bears this cost mostly because of the mystique      associated with "grafting". Actually, as tree-crop writers      like Downing point out, grafting is a simple, basic skill      that can be mastered by anyone who takes the trouble to      understand a few basic principles.<br />      <br />      First, the seedling must be raised. Smith describes one      interesting method: four plaster laths are nailed together      to form a tube of earth one inch square and three feet      long.<br />      <br />      The seed is placed near the surface of this tube, and as      the plant grows, roots cling to one lath previously soaked      in a nitrate of soda solution.<br />      <br />      The four-inch-high seedling with three feet of roots can      thus be planted deep into the ground using nothing more      than a crowbar to prepare the hole.<br />      <br />      Before germination is possible, some seed (notably nut      trees) must undergo a certain amount of freezing. The tree      raised from seed is not apt to develop true to the      character of the tree it came from. For this reason a      scion-or branch of the producing tree-is      grafted onto the root stock.<br />      <br />      Both scion and stock should be about the same diameter,      about 1/2 inch. Grafting should be done early in the spring      so that the wound will not be exposed long before growth      resumes. <em>Budding</em> and <em>layering</em> are other      methods of multiplying the progeny of an especially      desirable tree.<br />      <br />      In layering, a part of the parent plant is induced to grow      roots or shoots before separation from the plant. All of      these grafting processes (grafting is the healing in common      of two wounds) are best accomplished by the homesteader on      trees and seedlings <em>already planted</em> in their final      location on the homestead.<br />      <br />      Even dwarf fruit varieties can be started in this manner. A      dwarfed tree is nothing more than a stronggrowing scion      grafted onto a weak-growing root stock.<br />      <br />      A quince rootstock will dwarf a pear scion; but a pear that      is thus grafted on a quince root will tend to grow larger      and faster than the quince tree. The weak-growing quince      rootstock takes a little from the soil and requires small      amounts of carbohydrates for growth, whereas the      standard-size scion will accumulate carbohydrate at the      cost of protein assimilation. The high proportion of      carbohydrates to protein results in dwarfing and early      fruitation. The northern spy dwarf apple bears in 4 years      as against 15 years for standard varieties.<br />      <br />      Apple, pear, cherry, peach, plum and apricot trees can all      be successfully dwarfed, and they all certainly have a      place on the homestead. As mentioned earlier, due to their      low profile, dwarf "creeper" apple trees can be grown in a      Siberian weather zone. In general, a low, spreading tree      form should be encouraged . . . it maintains maximum sun      exposure and offers least resistance to wind. Shade over      the immediate soil area helps to conserve soil      moisture.<br />      <br />      Some tree experts even claim that a low-growing tree offers      less drain on soil fertility. The greatest vigor in a tree      is located near its top, so by pruning the top this vigor      is spread to other parts of the tree.    </p>        <p>      Of pruning, someone once said: "There is no horticultural      practice concerning which there is a greater diversity of      opinion or in the application of which there is a greater      diversity of procedure." According to the Illinois      Experimentation Station (Bulletin 376) pruning contributes      to the death of more trees mistakenly attributed to      "mishandling" than to any other single factor.<br />      <br />      The main purpose of pruning is to remove injured and      diseased growth. Without the protective outer cover that      bark offers, dead limbs are attractive to parasites and      saprophytic fungi.<br />      <br />      Another equally purposeful reason for pruning is to train      the young tree structurally . . . so it might better resist      wind, snow and ice damage at a later, more mature stage.      The "central leader" and "modified leader" patterns are in      common usage, along with the somewhat less popular "open      center" pattern. An open center tree has a structural      defect, but does receive more interior sunlight.<br />      <br />      As the tree matures, so too does the purpose of pruning. On      a mature tree one finally limits pruning activities to      maintaining a balance between vegetation and fruiting, and      between the root system and the vegetation system . . .      mostly by thinning out top growth. When transplanting, top      growth should be removed to balance the remaining root      system.    </p>        <p>      <br />      Downing recommends summer pruning in preference to winter      pruning, as wounds heal more rapidly while the tree remains      in active growth. The old adage that advises pruning during      the dormant period, "when the sap is down", is rather      foolish, as wood is just as sap-laden in winter as it is in      spring. In spring, mineral saturated water from the soil      travels <em>upward</em> through sapwood to the leaves. In      the leaf the water is converted into starches and sugars      and then travels <em>downward</em> through the inner bark,      feeding the tree en route.<br />      <br />      With practice and clear advice grafting can soon become one      of the rewarding "fun things" that one can do on the      homestead. The art of plant propagation is never really      learned or mastered . . . but at the outset one receives a      satisfaction that comes from cooperation with plant growth      processes.    </p>    <p>      Super-trained tree specimens-like espalier-can      be created, not without great patience and skill. Or exotic      conversation pieces can be displayed . . . as with the      five-variety apple tree or tomato-producing potato plant.      Some have even chosen to deal in an illicit grafting      practice . . . one that in current legal cases has even      jurisprudence bemuddled: a hop (Humulus lupulus) scion      grafted onto a marijuana (Cannabis sativa) rootstock will      produce a hop leaf suitable for psychedelic usage. Peace.    </p>
