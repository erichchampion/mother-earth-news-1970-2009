                    <p>      AFTER YEARS OF CRAPPY PLASTIC, WOODEN TOYS ARE BACK IN      STYLE! AND THE ONLY THING BETTER THAN BUYING SUCH      SATISFYING PLAYTHINGS FOR YOUR FAVORITE LITTLE PEOPLE IS      BUILDING 'EM YOURSELF. YOU CAN DO IT, TOO, WITH AN ASSIST      FROM PETER STEVENSON'S $9.95 BOOK,<br />    </p>    <p>      <br />      HERE, FROM THAT BOOK, ARE TWO SETS OF PLANS. THE FIRST      SHOWS YOU HOW TO PUT TOGETHER A CRADLE THAT'S JUST THE      RIGHT SIZE TO TUCK A DOLL OR TEDDY BEAR INTO. . . AND, IF      YOU FOLLOW THE SECOND, YOU'LL PRODUCE A FUNKY BIPLANE      GUARANTEED TO DELIGHT ANY YOUNG AVIATOR OR AVIATRIX.    </p>    <p>      From THE ART OF MAKING WOODEN TOYS, by Peter Stevenson.      Copyright Â©1971, by the author. Reprinted by      permission of the publisher, Chilton Book Company,      Philadelphia.    </p>    <h3>      the cradle    </h3>    <p>      The cradle design was taken almost verbatim from a      200-year-old New England version that has made a big hit      with the little ones ever since the days before George      Washington and his boys got busy, For the turned legs, use      ready-made room-divider posts available at most lumberyards      and home-supply stores. Of course, if you have access to a      wood lathe, then you're all set to make your own style      posts. Or if neither ready-made posts nor lathes seem to be      within your reach, the designs can be cut into the sides of      2" X 2" stock with a band saw or coping saw.    </p>    <p>      Only two of the ready-made 18" divider posts are needed.      Each post is cut near the center of the turned part,      forming one of the 10" posts for the head of the cradle, as      well as the 8" post for the foot of the cradle on one side.    </p>              <p>        <em>Step One: Cutting</em>      </p>    <p>      Mark the dimensions of the sides, the ends, and the bottom      of the cradle onto a 6' length of 1" X 8" stock with an      interesting grain. Make the straight cuts with a      carpenter's handsaw, a table saw, or a portable electric      circular saw. Then cut the scrollwork at the head end of      the cradle with a band, jig, saber, or coping saw. Now cut      the rockers from a 2' length of 2" X 4" stock.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Two: Drilling</em>    </p>    <p>      The box of the cradle is fastened together at the corners,      with 1-1/4", Number 8, flathead wood screws, or something      close to that size. The sides and ends of the cradle box      butt against the corner posts, flush with the inside edge.      Starter holes for the screws are drilled through the posts      in the positions shown, with a 1/8" drill bit. Then 3/8"      countersunk holes are drilled down into these starter holes      to a depth that will allow the screws to have a good bite      into the sides and ends of the box. Each corner post will      have a different set of adjacent joining sides, so drill      the countersunk holes separately for each post. Drill      starter holes and then countersunk holes where they are      shown along the bottom of the sides and ends for the screws      that will attach the sides to the bottom of the cradle.    </p>    <p>      Larger holes, roughly 3/4" to 1" in diameter, can now be      drilled down into the two short, flat surfaces on the top      edges of both rockers to serve as seats for the turned      bottom ends of the corner posts. Try to fit tile diameter      of the hole to the size of the turning inserted, and also      to make the holes of equal depth, about 1/2". Now drill      1/8" screw holes down through the centers of these holes      and out tile other side. Drill 3/8" countersunk holes in      from the bottom side to a depth that will allow the screws      to get a good bite into the ends of the posts.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Three: Assembling</em>    </p>    <p>      Place a line of white glue down one side of one of the      shorter legs and attach it to the foot end of one side,      flush with the inner edge. Now attach the longer post to      the other end in the same way, with screws and glue.    </p>    <p>      Assemble the other side to the other legs in the same      manner, making certain that the countersunk holes are      always to tile outside. Now attach the foot and head end      pieces to the corner posts of one side and, finally, attach      the other posts to the end pieces.    </p>    <p>      Slip the bottom of the cradle down between the sides, and      sink screws in from the sides and ends to hold it in place.    </p>    <p>      Insert the bottom ends of the corner posts at one end down      into the large holes in the top edge of one of the rockers,      after placing a dab of glue in cacti hole, of course. Then      run screws up from the bottom edge of the rocker firmly      into the bottom ends of the corner posts. Repeat this      performance to attach the other rocker at the other end.    </p>    <p>      A large variety of wooden drawer pull knobs call be found      to decorate the tops of the posts. These can be fastened      with glue and finishing nails, or double-ended screws, if      you like get fancy.    </p>        <p>      The decoration used on tile head end of the example      pictured was chosen from a number of nicely cast, press      wood "stick-ons" available at most home-supply and hobby      stores.    </p>    <p>      Cut a 3/8" dowel into very short lengths, about 1/4" to      3/8", with a band, hack or table saw, to make dowel plugs      cover the screwheads. Place a dab of glue in each      countersunk hole on one side of the cradle, then insert the      short stub, of dowel and with a mallet tap them into the      hole until flush with the surface. Repeat this on the other      sides until all holes are filled.    </p>    <p>      Round off all the upper edges of the cradle box, as well as      the rockers. Then sand with coarse, medium, and fine sand      paper to remove all potential splinters.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Four:</em> <em>Finishing</em>    </p>    <p>      The finish used can be whatever you and your young client      agree upon. The cradle could be antiqued and decorated      with<br />      colored embellishments, or varnished, or stained and then      wiped and given a coat or two of satin finish varnish, as      in this example. Now all you need is a blanket, a favorite      doll and a small girl to complete the set.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      LUMBER LIST for the Cradle    </p>    <p>      Six feet of 1" x 6" stock (with interesting grain)    </p>    <p>      Two 18"-long turned room-divider posts (about 1-1/2" thick)    </p>    <p>      Two feet of 2" X 4" stock    </p>    <p>      One foot of 3/8"-diameter wood dowel    </p>    <p>      Four decorative wood drawer-pull knobs    </p>    <p>      Three dozen 1-1/4", Number 8, flat- head wood screws    </p>    <p>      One or two decorative pressed-wood s    </p>		<h3>the biplane</h3>    <p>      The little French biplane, that nimble nemesis of the      Kaiser's best efforts, is a composite design taken from      several famous old birds, like the Nieuport, the Sopwith,      and the Avro. While the rotary engines in these early      beasts looked much like the radial engines of today, they      were different in that instead of the crankshaft's turning      the propeller, the prop was bolted to the engine and the      whole engine rotated, leaving the crankshaft stationary.    </p>    <p>      Control of these engines fell somewhat short of precise,      with power tending to be either Full-On or Full-Off; hence      the strange <em>Bup, bup, barrup</em> sound they made when      coming in for a landing.    </p>    <p>      Having two short sets of wings gave them plenty of climbing      power, while still allowing great ability and strength. And      in the hands of a Rickenbacker, or a Lufberry, they were      quite a sight to see going through their paces.    </p>        			<p>        To make this version, start with a 1' length of        clear-grained, softwood 4" X 4" stock to make the        fuselage.      </p>    <p>      <em>Step One Cutting</em>    </p>    <p>      Make a copy of the fuselage profile (full-scale size) in      the plans, using carbon paper, tracing paper or a copier;      then cut this pattern to trace the profile onto the wood.      Use a band saw or coping saw to cut out tile profile of      tile fuselage. Their draw a center line down the top of the      fuselage, and tract, around a pattern; draw the top outline      onto the top of the fuselage. Cut this out.    </p>    <p>      The tail surfaces and propeller are drawn onto 1/4"-thick      plywood or paneling, and then cut out with a band, jig,      saber or coping saw.    </p>    <p>      Cut four 6"lengths of 3/8"-diameter wood dowel and three 3"      lengths of 3/8" dowel. Cut one last piece of 5/16"-diameter      dowel, 4 1/8" long.    </p>    <p>      The wings are cut from tapered 3/4" X 6" or 3/4"x -8"      lapped house-siding lumber. A 4' piece is as short as you      can buy it in most yards, but you might be able to happen      onto some cut-off ends in the scrap pile of the yard. If,      for some reason, you can't find any of this standard house      siding, wings call be made from 1/2-"thick stock.    </p>    <p>      When marking on the outlines of the wings, align tile      trailing edges of the wings with tile thin edge of tile      tapered siding. Mark a center line down tile piece of      siding and use tile wing patterns to draw the complete      wings on both sides of the line.    </p>    <p>      Cut the wheels from 1/2"-thick scrap plywood with the      2-1/4"-diameter hole-saw attachment for tile power drill.    </p>    <p>      For the engine cowling, use a very short piece of hardwood      4" X 4" (or any wood with a color that contrasts with the      fuselage wood). Slice off one end of the 4" X 4" as      squarely as you can manage. Now mark a squared line around      the 4" X 4", 1-1/8" in from the first cut, and slice off a      nicely squared 1-1/8" piece of 4"X 4" (preferably without      any cracks in it). Draw a 2-3/4" diameter circle on the end      grain of this slice and cut it out.    </p>        <p>      <em>Step Two: Drilling</em>    </p>    <p>      The two strut holes can be drilled into the top of the      fuselage now with a 3/8" wood drill bit, as shown in the      plans. Also drill a 3/8" hole for the tail skid in the      bottom of the fuselage, angled in from the back.    </p>    <p>      Drill the 3/8" holes shown in the wing patterns into the      top of the wings. With a 1/8" bit, drill a hole through the      center point of the engine circle, a hole through the      center of the propeller, a hole through the bottom wing      near the center, as shown, and two holes in the edge of the      rudder, one down through the top edge, and one in from the      bottom back edge, as shown. A 1/8" hole is also needed down      through the center of the pilot's head.    </p>    <p>      Now, with a 1/16" drill bit (or with one of the 1"-long      finishing nails with the head nipped off mounted in the      drill), space four holes around the center hole in the      propeller, as shown. Drill holes in from the edges of the      wings, directly into the strut holes with this small bit,      as shown in the side view.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Three: Shaping</em>    </p>    <p>      To form the fuselage, use a wood rasp or, better yet, a      serrated wood shaper to round over the top of the fuselage      in front and in back of the cockpit. Round off the bottom      of the fuselage sides slightly, and then smooth up the      sides. Round off the edges of the wings, the tail      surfasces, and the wheels. Place the engine cowling face-up      on a firm, flat surface, and spend a little time rounding      it into a smooth, bowl-shaped form.    </p>    <p>      Remove the shaper marks from all tile parts with coarse      sandpaper. Then use medium sandpaper to remove the      scratches left by the coarse paper, and finally leave a      nice, polished surface on the parts with fine sandpaper.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Four: Assembling</em>    </p>        <p>      With the fuselage upside down, place the lower wing in      position; drill two short starter holes through the      screwholes in the wing and into the bottom of the fuselage.      Attach the wing to the fuselage with white glue and      1-1/4'", Number 8, flathead wood screws.    </p>    <p>      Place a dab of glue in each strut hole in the top of the      fuselage, insert two of the 3" lengths of 3/8" dowel, and      tap them firmly down into the holes. Insert the tops of      these dowels into the holes provided in the top wing, and      lower the wing to approximately the height shown in the      side view.    </p>    <p>      The 6" lengths of dowel can be inserted through the      remaining holes in both wings. Adjust the position of the      upper wing so that it is squared at the right height above      the lower wing, as shown in the plans. With the 1/16" bit,      drill starter holes in through the holes already drilled in      the edges of the wings, and into the strut dowels.    </p>    <p>      Rest the trailing edges of the wings on a firm, flat      surface and drive 1" finishing nails into the edge holes      and into the dowels. Check the alignment of the wings from      the top, sides, and front as this nailing progresses. The      leftover struts sticking out from the top and bottom of the      wings can now be trimmed off with a hacksaw or coping saw,      cutting carefully and with the grain of the wings. Sand the      strut ends flush with the wing surfaces. A drop of glue      around each strut where it enters the wing will make the      structure even sturdier.    </p>    <p>      Now the horizontal tail surface can be glued and railed to      the top of the tear end of the fuselage. Insert two 2"      finishing nails in through the holes in the edges of the      rudder, run a bit of glue along the edges that join with      the top and end of tile fuselage, and finally, holding the      rudder squarely in place, drive the nails into the      fuselage. Check the rudder from the front view and square      it up a bit if needed.    </p>    <p>      To attach the propeller to the engine, place a dab of glue      on the backside of the center of the prop and insert a 2"      finishing nail through the front of the center hole and      into the hole in the engine center. Place a small finishing      nail in each of the small holes around the center of the      prop, and drive them in, leaving just a little of the heads      sticking out of the prop. Check, to see that the engine      assembly can rotate freely around a 2" finishing nail. If      not, clean out the hole a little with a 1/8" bit.    </p>    <p>      Place the engine against the front of tile fuselage in the      position shown in the side view, and drive in the center      nail, leaving enough play for the engine to turn freely.      Bend the nail slightly if the engine hangs up in one place      when turning over. It will loosen up more and more as time      goes on.    </p>    <p>      Step Five: The Landing Gear    </p>        <p>      The landing gear is made from aluminum counter-edge      stripping. This comes in 3' lengths with holes drilled      every five or six incites. It's about 5/8" wide and beveled      on both edges of one side. Lacking this, 5/8"-wide iron      strap can be used.    </p>    <p>      Cut the stripping into two 4-3/8" lengths and one 6-3/4"      length. Mark a line across the long piece at the center.      Now mark a 1/8" hole 5/8" away from the center line on each      side, and drill these holes with the 1/8" bit. Make a mark      3/8" in from both ends of the stripping, and drill 3/8"      holes at these marks. Drill 3/8" holes 3/8" in from the      squared ends of the shorter pieces, and then 1/8" holes      1/2" in from the other of the short pieces. Round off the      ends of the strippings with the 3/8" holes, using a file.    </p>    <p>      Bend the longer piece as shown in the plans, with the      beveled side to the outside. Bend the ends of the shorter      pieces, over in different directions so that there is a      left and a right side with the beveled side out.    </p>    <p>      Mount the long strip to the bottom wing, flush with the      front of the fuuselage, with screws.    </p>    <p>      With the help of a hammer, insert one end of the 4-1/8"      length of 5/16" dowel through a center hole in one of the      wheels, so that the dowel sticks out the other side of the      wheel a little less than 1/8". Place the plane upside down      on a flat surface, and insert the end of the axle through      one of the end holes in the long landing-gear piece. Slip      the holes in the shorter pieces over the end of the axle      with the beveled sides out and the bent-over ears pointing      toward the center of the plane. Now insert the axle through      the hole in the other end of the mounted, long piece of the      landing gear. Insert end of the axle down into the center      hole of the other wheel (lying flat on the bench) and tap      the axle through so than just barely sticks out the other      side of the wheel. Now place the plane upside down again      and mount the shorter lengths of stripping firmly with      screws through the 1/8" holes, positioning them up against      the inside of the longer piece of stripping. Tap a glued      3/8" dowel tail skid into the hole in the tail bottom and      cut off on an angle about 1-1/2" below the fuselage.    </p>    <p>      <em>Step Six: Painting</em>    </p>    <p>      After a final light sanding, a coat or two of satin finish      varnish will bring out the contrasting wood tones (watch      for drips along the sides of the cockpit and the struts).      When dry, the rudder can be painted gloss white. When this      is dry, the vertical bands of red and blue can be painted      on.    </p>    <p>      With a small, round paintbrush, paint in the flat or      semigloss black circle around the center of the engine      cowling, as shown in the photos. While you have the black      handy, paint the tires, which come about 1/4" to 3/8" in      from the outer edge of the wheel discs.    </p>    <p>      The time has come to create a pilot for this worthy little      bird. Drive a 2" finishing nail down through the center of      the top of the pilot's head (a 1-1/2" drawer-pull ball),      leaving just the head of the nail sticking out the top.      Sketch the face on the head and with the 1/16" bit drill      two holes about 1/2" deep for the tacks that will form the      eyes. Hammer in the two 3/4"-long, roundhead brass tacks,      then paint on the black moustache and helmet, and place two      small black dots in the center of the tack heads for eyes.    </p>        <p>      While this is drying, cut a 5/8" X 6" strip of checked      cotton or other thin material, and fray the ends. Tie a      double knot of the material around the nail sticking out      the bottom <em>of</em> the head, leaving one end about an      inch longer than the other.    </p>    <p>      Now the head can be hammered down into a starter hole      drilled down into the center <em>of</em> the cockpit.    </p>    <p>      This done, it's "contact" time, heads up, tails over the      dashboard, and off to the Dawn Patrol with all due haste.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LUMBER LIST FOR THE BIPLANE</strong>    </p>    <p>      One foot of clear-grained soft wood 4" X 4"<br />      Two feet of tapered 1" X 6" or 1" X 8" lapped house      siding<br />      Three feet of 3/8"-diameter wood dowel<br />      Six inches of 5/16"-diameter wood dowel<br />      A small scrap of 1/4"-thick plywood or paneling at least 6"      X 6"<br />      Half a dozen 1-1/4", Number 8, flathead wood screws<br />      A small scrap of 1/2"-thick plywood at least 3" X 6"<br />      Two dozen 1"-finishing nails<br />      One short length of hardwood 4" X 4" stock<br />      Three feet of 5/8"-wide, beveled aluminum edge      stripping<br />      A 1-1/2"-diameter wood drawer-pull ball<br />      Two 3/4"-long roundhead brass tacks<br />      A 5/8" X 6"-long strip of checked material    </p>
