The instant his big,      black, wet nose touched the electrified netting that      surrounds the laying hens' pen, Japhy let out a terrified      yelp. He jumped, spun clear around in mid-air and took off      running in the other direction, squealing in protest and      fright.    </p>    <p>      Relax, dog lovers. Mr. Japhy wasn't injured one little bit.      Yes, a quick electric shock hurts. Getting hit with a few      thousand volts, for even 1/3,000th of a second, does cause      a bit of pain. But that's the whole idea: The shock      inflicts no physical damage, but it does leave a lasting      impression.    </p>    <p>      Japhy learned his lesson. He hasn't gone anywhere near the      chickens again - except on a leash, to pose for his      picture.    </p>    <p>      In recent years, electric fencing innovations have      revolutionized some forms of livestock grazing and      protection, and garden crop protection, too.    </p>    <p>      Now, effective and relatively inexpensive temporary      electric fencing is available to protect everything from      small animals such as chickens in the barnyard or in      pastured poultry programs to larger animals such as riding      hones out for weekend trail rides or involved in strip      grazing.    </p>    <p>      Although some electric fences are considered permanent,      much like a traditionally built fence, other styles are      intended for semi-permanent or temporary applications,      giving users more flexibility and economy in meeting such      fencing needs titian they've ever had in the past. Modern      temporary styles of electric fencing include the familiar      rope lines, some tape-like styles and various sizes of mesh      netting; all can be set up or taken down in a matter of      minutes.    </p>        <p>      Pennsylvania farmer Brian Moyer pastures 1,400 broilers      annually, using 42-inch-high electric netting with 3      1/2-inch-square openings and plastic post. Moyer says he      especially likes the heavy-plastic, step-in posts, which he      just pushes into the ground with his foot (or in dry times,      hammers in with a rubber mallet.)    </p>    <p>      The portability of temporary electric fencing means it can      he moved about according to pre-planned grazing patterns.      The practice allows more intensive use of pasturelands than      is possible with permanent fencing of larger areas. Aaron      Silverman raises about 15,000 broilers a year in a small      valley in Oregon. "Our fields are bordered by riparian      zones - a river or a creek where there are nesting      marsh hawks and red-tailed hawks, bobcat runs and coyote      trails.    </p>    <p>      "When we started with traditional pastured poultry zones,      we confined the birds to the portable enclosures at all      times and moved the enclosures once, maybe twice a day. We      noticed that whenever we were close to a riparian zone, we      would lose birds to raccoons, 'possums and skunks, which      were able to sneak under the fencing."    </p>    <p>      To establish secure outdoor pens for the birds, Silverman      tested electric sheep netting, with mesh small enough to      stop coyotes, but not weasels, "so we were still losing      birds." Next, he tried electric poultry netting with      2-by-3-inch openings and thin, rigid-plastic verticals that      keep the fence upright without corner tension braces.    </p>    <p>      "That pretty much took care of it," he says. The netted      fence keeps out predators as small as rats - as long      as it's moved regularly. When left in place for several      weeks, such as around a greenhouse-turned-brooder house,      rats eventually tunnel underneath to get at the chickens.      "In the field," he says, "where we are moving the fence on      a continual basis, they (the rats) respect it."    </p>    <h3>      HOW IT WORKS    </h3>    <p>      Electric fencing runs on a charger, which converts a      typical 110-volt, 15-amp branch circuit, such as those you      might find in a house, into a pulsed, high-voltage,      low-current output. Although the potential involved may be      on the order of 2,500 to 9,000 volts, the current is      limited to a safe level and the actual pulse lasts only      milliseconds.    </p>    <p>      According to David Hart of Underwriters Laboratories, a      minimal one-second duration is mandatory between pulses to      allow people who inadvertently grab onto a "hot" wire the      time to let go and avoid injury. Continuous current causes      the muscles to contract, making letting go difficult and      potentially interfering with the function of the heart.    </p>    <p>      The fence wire is connected to a ground rod, usually just a      galvanized pipe that has been driven deep into the ground.      Any conductive material, such as a critter's nose or ears,      that touches the wire after it has been electrified      completes the circuit and - <em>ZAP!</em> The critter      gets a short but unpleasant shock.    </p>    <p>      But gone are the days when you had to drive big metal or      wooden posts into hard, rocky ground and wrestle with heavy      reels of stiff wire that always wanted to go anywhere but      where you wanted them to go. Permanent high-tensile      electric fencing still has its place for perimeter fences,      corrals and other applications where the fence is meant to      last, but the new temporary styles are gaining popularity      quickly on many farms and homesteads.    </p>    <p>      Most of the temporary equipment fits together easily with      just a rubber mallet, screwdriver, pocketknife and a pair      of pliers. And you can buy it at just about any farm supply      center or from a variety of specialty companies, which      often offer application and installation tips on their Web      sites.    </p>    <h3>      THE POWER SUPPLY    </h3>        <p>      You'll need an adequate charger to control the electricity      flowing to whatever type of fencing you choose. Chargers      running on 110-volt AC (household) current provide maximum      shocking power, so many people run an AC supply wire from      their house or barn into their fields, and then connect      their temporary fencing onto it wherever needed. Chargers      range in price from $60 to $400.    </p>    <p>      In remote locations, battery-powered chargers are almost as      effective. Batteries range in size from flashlight to      deep-cycle marine, and optional solar panels will recharge      them even on cloudy days, which can double a battery's      life. Prices for batteries with solar chargers range from      $180 to $280.    </p>    <p>      To really boost shocking power, especially on dry ground or      snow, use " Pos/Neg" fencing, now available in a variety of      styles.    </p>    <p>      Traditional electric fencing has a positive charge in each      electrified wire. It relies on the animal making good      contact with the soil in order to ground the charge and      receive a shock. That doesn't always happen when soils are      sandy, rocky, dry or covered with snow. Having both      positive and negative (grounded) wires manufactured right      in the fence increases the chance of an animal receiving a      convincing shock.    </p>    <p>      Weeds also can complete the circuit when they touch the      wires, sometimes shorting out the fence so it can't shock      anything. Today s fence chargers can carry what the      catalogs call a "heavy weed load," but don't expect to just      setup an electric fence and forget it. The more you keep      grass and weeds in check, the better your fence will work.      Keep all electric fences free of branches, grass, weeds and      debris that can short out the whole fence.    </p>    <p>      Electrified netting requires the most maintenance. When      left around vegetable beds for the season, it needs to be      moved periodically and the grass mowed or weed-whacked. Or      place cardboard, carpet or flat stones under it to prevent      weeds from growing up and touching the wire.    </p>    <h3>      TRICKS OF THE TRADE    </h3>    <p>      Regardless of what you add to your system in the way of end      posts, line posts, insulators, switches (very useful when      searching for a short) and other gizmos, a few basic rules      apply to all electric fencing.    </p>    <p>      First, electric fences really do their job, but only if      they're turned on - all of the time. That's why      vegetable growers, pastured poultry producers and other      users equip their fences with blinking lights or alarms to      signal operational problems.    </p>    <p>      Want a good night's sleep? There is nothing more reassuring      just before slipping between the sheets than glancing out a      bedroom window, seeing that little twinkle of light pulsing      in the far field and knowing that your defense shields are      activated. of course, if the field is totally dark, there      is nothing more exasperating than stomping outside through      the wet grass in your bare feet to find that you've merely      forgotten to plug the fence charger back in. Like the wild      and domestic animals learn to avoid the fence, you soon      will learn to turn it back on after you've consciously shut      it down for whatever reason.    </p>    <p>      Second, making good contact with a charged fence wire is      the only way animals will develop a healthy respect for the      fence. Many people set a pan of feed just outside the fence      to train young livestock to stay away. Baiting the fence      with peanut butter or other lures also assures that      predators get the message to keep out. (See "Making Big      Impressions on Bambi,".)    </p>    <p>      Third, electric fence is primarily a psychological      deterrent, not a physical barrier. Any animal that is      hungry, scared or being chased can and probably will run      right through or leap over an energized electric fence. But      that can happen with traditional fencing, too.    </p>    <p>      Whatever you decide to install, get a voltage tester so you      can make sure your fence is well-grounded, and pinpoint the      problem when it shorts out. Mr. Japhy might agree that's a      lot better than relying on your pets to tell you whether      your fence is working properly.    </p>    <h3>      Electric Fencing Folks    </h3>  <p>      Gallagher Power Fence<br />      (800) 4940368<br />    <a href="http://www.gallagherusa.com" target="_blank">www.gallagherusa.com</a>    </p>    <p>      Geotek<br />      (800) 533-1680<br />    <a href="http://www.geotekinc.com" target="_blank">www.geotekinc.com</a>    </p>    <p>      Premier Fence<br />      (800) 282-6631<br />    <a href="http://www.premier1supplies.com" target="_blank">www.premier1supplies.com</a>    </p>    <p>      Kencove<br />      (800) 536-2683<br />    <a href="http://www.kencove.com" target="_blank">www.kencove.com</a>    </p>    <p>      Ferris Fencing (Canada)<br />      (250) 7579677<br />    <a href="http://www.ferrisfencing.com" target="_blank">www.ferrisfencing.com</a>    </p>    <h3>      Making Big Impressions on Bambi    </h3>        <p>      The fence is made of horizontal wires set 2 inches apart      near the ground and vertical wires every 12 inches. To      repel deer, it is set up directly under two strands of      electrified tape strung on 4-foot fiberglass rods "That      can't be deer fence!" visitors often exclaim when they see      the two strands of hot tape. "A deer can jump right over      that!"    </p>    <p>      Sure it can; the idea is to teach deer that the pain is not      worth the gain. That's why electric fences are often      "baited" with peanut butter or apple juice concentrate,      which is guaranteed to draw a deer's sensitive nose to the      wire. Just fold a few flinch squares of aluminum foil that      have been smeared with peanut butter over the fence wire,      or use commercially made metal pans with cotton pads and      twist ties. Just the white-and-black coloring of many      electric fence ropes or tapes put deer on guard; wind that      makes the fencing bounce, hum and even buzz loudly spooks      deer even more. - <em>George DeVault</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>

Temporary electric fencing and netting, like that shown at the top of the page, work well for smaller animals, or very short-term applications for large livestock.
