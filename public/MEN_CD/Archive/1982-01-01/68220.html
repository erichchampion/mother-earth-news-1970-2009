            <p>      An inexpensive, easy-to-build grow-frame allows an      inventive New Zealander to...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Julia Todd Forbes    </h5>        <p>      For most of us, the onset of winter means the end of      freshly harvested garden produce . . . and I used to      <em>hate</em> that! Though I've never been able to afford a      greenhouse, I've always felt that I somehow had a      <em>right</em> to homegrown salads all year round.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, I knew that when sun strikes dark soil, it      heats up the earth and the air immediately above it. So all      I really needed (I decided) was a structure that would let      in the rain and sun . . . shelter my plants from blasts of      cold air . . . and allow enough ventilation to prevent the      molds, diseases, sour soil, and moss so common to      greenhouses. Of course, my invention also had to be      inexpensive, easy-to-build, sturdy enough to stand up      against strong winter winds, and able to coexist with the      four-foot-wide, fertile beds that I'd religiously composted      for five years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A PROBABLE SOLUTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Well, my needs and abilities finally got together, and the      result was an 18"-high frame-built of 1 X      4's-that fit exactly <em>over</em> one of my raised      vegetable patches. Its sides were enclosed in 10-mil, clear      plastic (polyvinyl chloride), which was secured with tacks      ("washers" made from folded bits of plastic trimmings      prevent the wind from enlarging the tack holes).    </p>    <p>      Next, I cut 4"-wide strips of the same plastic, long enough      to stretch across the width of the top and come down 4      inches on each side. Again using homemade washers, I tacked      the strips in place-spacing them 1 inch      apart-all along the frame's top. <em>Eureka!</em> My      "New Zea land Grow-Frame" was born . . . and it worked!    </p>    <p>      The sun warmed up the soil, <em>and</em> the atmosphere      within the structure, by a full 20Â°F. And, while the      frame protected the plants from the wind, it also provided      excellent ventilation. Rain fell readily through the spaces      between the strips . . . and I could easily slip my hands      through the slots to harvest, transplant, and weed.    </p>    <p>      I hate to brag . . . but my invention proved to be such a      darned good way to grow things that I decided to use the      frames <em>throughout</em> my garden. For four winters now      I've enjoyed-along with lettuce-freshly picked      carrots, beets, parsnips, chard, and parsley!    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXTRA BONUSES!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Even my brainchild's one possible disadvantage turned out      to be an asset. I knew the plastic was bound to reduce the      amount of sunshine that reached the plants . . . and less      light (I had thought) would decrease photosynthesis.    </p>    <p>      Well, as it happened, the diminished light was particularly      <em>good</em> for lettuce! It seems that moderate shading      tends to limit transpiration (the loss of moisture)      <em>more</em> than it reduces photosynthesis. Therefore,      the leaves became longer, broader, thinner, tenderer, and      smallerveined . . . precisely the characteristics I      <em>wanted</em> in my lettuce.    </p>    <p>      But the assets didn't stop there! I discovered that the      grow-frame also works well in summer, so removing and      storing it for half the year is unnecessary. The      four-season capability of the mini-hothouse was revealed      when, suddenly, it was midsummer . . . and my      plants-still in their winter home-were not only      growing like gangbusters, but needing <em>less water</em>      than did those in open beds.    </p>    <p>      In fact, the only time I have to water inside the frame is      when I transplant seedlings. As a result, the surface soil      stays dry, while the earth beneath this layer is always      moist. Furthermore, the interior of the frame is never too      humid, so that nasty "brown rot" can't attack my lettuce.    </p>    <p>      In addition, when the wind flutters the plastic strips, it      actually sets up afield of static electricity which, some      say, stimulates plant growth. (For more about this, see the      work done on electrical fields by L.G. Lawrence as reported      in <em>The Secret Life of Plants</em> by Peter Tompkins and      Christopher Bird, Harper & Row, 1973, $12.95.) True or      not, I've certainly raised some happy-looking vegetables!    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUITE AN IMPROVEMENT</strong>    </p>
