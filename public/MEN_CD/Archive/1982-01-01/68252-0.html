        TOP FROM LEFT: A youngster learns to use a recurve bow .... Place your index finger at the corner of your mouth to provide a constant anchor point .... Bow-sight pins can be adjusted vertically or horizontally to promote accurate marksmanship .... An arm guard (also called a ""bracer"") and a shooting glove are essential .... Use a target/field point (left below) for practice, a Judo point (top left) or a blunt (top right) for field roving and hunting small game, and a broadhead point (bottom) for big game .... String the arrow directly under the nocking locator .... The versatile compound bow.
