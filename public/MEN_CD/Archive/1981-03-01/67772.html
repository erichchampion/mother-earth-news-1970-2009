                <p>      Most gardeners, at one time or another, consider buying a      rototiller... and the primary consideration in doing so is      matching the implement to the job(s) that it'll be expected      to perform. In order to help our readers choose the      machines they <em>need</em> , MOTHER has compiled...    </p>             <p>      A rototiller is a <em>big</em> investment, and many folks      find that they can get along lust fine renting or borrowing      the machines when they need them ... usually no more than      <em>once</em> in the spring to <em>till</em> the garden,      and again in the fall to chop up crop wastes <em>and</em>      expose belowground insect larvae, etc.    </p>    <p>      However, the more involved a person becomes with wholistic      gardening, the more practical it often becomes for him or      her to <em>own</em> a tiller. After all, the machines can      be used to cultivate between rows <em>throughout</em> the      growing season (produring an orderly and weed-free garden      without the timeconsuming labor of hand hoeing) ... to      retill areas as crops mature and are harvested (allowing      for easy succession planting) ... and more.    </p>    <p>      But it's often difficult for the potential tiller owner to      decide just <em>how much</em> machine he or she needs. And      the decision is an important one, because the prices of      rototillers tend to rise in proportion to the      <em>power</em> of the tools. Therefore, buying too      <em>large</em> a tiller for your purposes can result in      unnecessary expense, <em>and</em> inconvenience when trying      to maneuver the big machine around a small garden ... while      purchasing too <em>small</em> a tiller can result in      frustration, extra labor, and-worse yet-even      the need to <em>rent</em> a large model to break up your      soil before the "little teller" can handle it!    </p>    <p>      There are, of course, any number of good tillers on the      market, but in preparing this article, we decided to limit      ourselves to a sampling-which spans the most popular      horsepower ratings-of <em>rear</em> -tined tillers.      The following list of machines isn't complete, then, and      isn't meant to imply that tillers not included are in any      way inferior to those listed. It is, however, intended to      give you an understanding of what you can expect from the      four specific models tested ... and of the      <em>potential</em> of other machines with similar      horsepower ratings.    </p>    <h3>THEYELLOWBIRD</h3>    <p>      The little Yellowbird (sold by Precision Valley      Manufacturing Co., Dept. TMEN, Springfield, Vermont 05156)      is-as far as we know-the smallest reartined      tiller on the market. Weighing a scant 75 pounds without      its blades in place and sporting a 3-HP Briggs &      Stratton engine, the Bird is a fine tool for gardeners who      have small plots and/or often need to till in confined      areas.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the machine's light weight and limited      horsepower may be <em>disadvantages</em> when one has a      large garden or needs to cultivate unbroken sod. However,      we found that even the latter task <em>can</em> be      accomplished with the small tiller. In our tests the Bird      was able to work a previously unbroken pasture to a depth      of 4-1/2 inches, although eight passes with the machine      <em>were</em> necessary to do so.    </p>    <p>      Our gardeners/ testers also noted that they often wished      the Yellowbird had handlebar- mounted speed and throttle      adjustments (the wheels and tines turn at set speeds, while      the throttle is controlled at the engine) ... the ability      to operate in reverse (which can be important when      reworking difficult patches of ground) ... <em>and</em> the      option of disengaging the tines while keeping the wheels      turning for transport. (The little tiller's single forward      speed also left something to be desired when traveling from      garden to barn, garage, or basement.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, our evaluators praised the narrow (14")      tines, which-in conjunction with the tiller's light      weight-made working in between established rows of      plants (without accidentally wiping out crops) a breeze.      The gardeners found the folding handle to be convenient,      too-allowing for easy storage <em>and</em> auto trunk      or station wagon transport-and appreciated the      reversible depth-adjustment bar ... which can either ride      smoothly in the tilled soil or, when attached backwards,      hook itself into the earth and force the tines to dig in.    </p>    <p>      The Yellowbird, all in all, is especially designed for      people with smaller "back- yard" gardens and-for such      folks-represents a good swap of power for agility and      convenience.    </p>    <h3>THE ARIENS</h3>    <p>      The 5-HP Tecumseh-engined Ariens tiller (Ariens Company,      Dept. TMEN, Brillion, Wisconsin 54110) constitutes a      "middle ground"-in both power range and weight (about      275 pounds)-between the little Yellowbird and the      "big boys" described below.    </p>    <p>      MOM's evaluators were <em>every</em> much impressed with      the Arrens' overall performance. They did, however,      criticize its lack of a "high-range" forward speed      (available on other Ariens models) for going to and from      the garden, and wish that it weren't necessary to bend over      to engage the tines or wheels (admittedly a small      criticism).    </p>    <p>      The tiller's <em>good</em> points far outweighed the bad,      however. It features a reversible depth bar, as does the      Yellowbird. And, unlike the smaller machine, its tines      <em>can</em> be disengaged while the wheels are in      operation... so you can walk the tiller across your lawn      without worrying about accidentally taking out an 18" swath      of carefully nurtured bluegrass (actually, the tine width      can be adjusted from 12" to 19"). Perhaps the best feature      of the Artens, though, is its ability to <em>use</em> the      power put out by its relatively small five-horse engine.      The machine was able to reach a depth of 4-1/2      inches-starting on unturned sod-in four passes.      If your garden is of reasonable size and if you'll      occasionally have to tackle hard-to-work soil, we think      you'll find the Ariens to be an <em>excellent</em> choice      for the money.    </p>    <h3>THE TROY-BILT HORSE</h3>    <p>      The Troy-Bill (Garden Way Manufacturing Company, Inc.,      Dept. TMEN, 102nd Street and 9th Avenue, Troy, New York      12180) has, as a result of its great (and deserved)      popularity, become almost everyone's image of a rear-tined      tiller. For our tests, we chose the 7-HP, Kohler-engined      "Horse" model. Weighing in at approximately 286 pounds, the      machine is only a little heavier than is the Ariens, but      gives an <em>impression</em> of far greater size.    </p>    <p>      All of our testers had used Troy-Bilt machines prior to      meeting the Horse, and many of them had actually      <em>owned</em> tillers manufactured by the New York firm.      Despite such familiarity, though, there <em>were</em> a few      criticisms.    </p>    <p>      For one thing, several of the people who used the tiller      were disturbed by its front-heaviness... finding that the      tool "wanted" to tip forward. Furthermore, those who'd      enjoyed the reversible depth bar on the Ariens and      Yellowbird, and the ability of the Ariens to keep its      wheels running while the tines are disengaged, were      disappointed that the Troy Bilt lacked these two features.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the Horse incorporates an "automatic clutch" that      causes the machine to shift into "neutral" automatically      when the tines encounter hidden rocks or unusually hard      ground ... a feature which prevents the tiller from running      away with its operator. On the unit that we tested,      however, the safety mechanism appeared to be <em>too</em>      sensitive and shifted the machine into neutral at the      slightest lurch. (This problem could certainly be handled      by a not-too difficult adjustment.)    </p>    <p>      Again, however, the tiller's good points overshadowed its      bad ones. Everybody was impressed by the quality of the      Troy-Bilt's construction ... andevenmoreby the fact that      the design allows adjustments and parts replacement to be      easily handled by the owner. The machine has a good range      of speeds, too, being able to hunker down at 0.5 MPH for      hard work or roll along at 1.72 MPH when the job's done and      it's time to go home. And, in our "unbroken sod" tests, the      Horse opened an (adjustable) 20"-wide, 4-1/2"-deep seed bed      in three passes.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the single best quality of the Troy-Bill tiller,      however, is the manufacturer's <em>commitment</em> to      wholistic gardening, as represented by the incredibly      detailed owner's manual (which not only covers almost any      maintenance chore that the owner might have occasion to      perform, but even gives detailed instructions for      everything from tilling on slopes to green-manure cropping      and wide-row gardening) and the information-packed,      five-issue-a-year owners' newsletter put out by the      company. Garden Way really <em>does</em> seem to try to      make its customers feel part of the "Troy-Bllt Family" ...      and, when the careful instructions that the firm provides      are heeded, the sturdy machine should give <em>years</em>      of versatile and productive service.    </p>      <h3>THE SEARS TASK HANDLER</h3>    <p>      When we contacted the folks at Sears, Roebuck and Co.      (Dept. TMEN. Sears Tower, Chicago. Illinois 60684) to ask      whether they had a tiller that would fill out the      "heavyweight" side of our evaluation, they had to put us      off for a few weeks. It seems that the company <em>did</em>      have a unique new model in the works, but hadn't as yet      finished testing it. Before long, though, the prototype      8-HP (Briggs & Stratton-powered) unitarrived ... and      quickly proved itself to be well worth the wait!    </p>    <p>      The most noteworthy features of the Sears Task Handler are      its counter-rotating tines (CRT). While all the other      tillers tested for this article have blades that spin      "forward", as do the wheels, the new Sears design      incorporates "diggers" that turn in the opposite direction      from its tires. Therefore, the tines <em>pullagainst</em>      the wheels, and the struggle between the opposing forces      really lets the tiller churn up earth! Moreover, the tilled      soil is actually lifted and thrown back upon the tines ...      in effect doubletilling a <em>very</em> fine-particled      seedbed.    </p>    <p>      Our testers found little to criticize about the CRT. They      did note that the machine is too large to be useful in      close quarters, but most felt that few people would even      <em>purchase</em> such a tiller for use in small or cramped      spaces. The choke control was called "frail" by one of our      evaluators... but-since our unit is a one-of-a-kind      test model-that feature might be beefed up before the      machine reaches production. (On the other hand, we can't      speculate on the long-term reliability of this very new      design ... although it held up well for us. )    </p>    <p>      And everyone who tried the tiller was astonished at how      well <em>balanced</em> the 300-pound machine is!      Furthermore, the Task Handler is clearly the best "digger"      of the bunch ... able to churn up a beautifully prepared      21"-wide. 4-1/2"-deep bed-on previously unbroken      sod-in <em>one pass</em> . The handlebar controls      were well liked, too, especially the convenient safety      clutchrelease ... but the machine's ability to make short      work of any job that you'd conceivably ask of a tiller is      far and away its best feature. If you're the sort who has a      big garden (or, perhaps, who tills other folks' plots for      parttime cash) and deals with difficult soil types, you're      not likely to find another tiller that'll help you do your      work more quickly or more easily.    </p>    <h3>IN CONCLUSION ...</h3>    <p>      There you have it ... a rundown on four representatives of      the rear-tined tiller world. As noted above, <em>any</em>      of the machines in this evaluation is worthy of      recommendation, <em>if</em> the scope of your gardening      activities matches its abilities. Study the information      here and in the accompanying chart before making a purchase      and-if possible-try to <em>borrow</em> a number      of different machines to "test run" before you lay down      your hardearned bucks ... and you'll end up with a garden      helper that'll be a pleasure to use for years to come!    </p>
