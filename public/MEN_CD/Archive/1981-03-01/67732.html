                <p>      <em>If you use wind power to provide water for your      livestock, you may be able to up the system's      efficiency.</em>    </p>                        <h5 id="byline">By Edward Burlbaw</h5>      <p>      Folks who attempt to set up a wind pump on a shoestring      budget-as I did-may find that, after buying a      gearbox, tower, cylinder, and well pipe, there's not much      cash left over for a standard "sucker rod". That's what      happened to <em>me</em> , anyway, and I had to make do with      a substitute. So, after scrounging around, I bought a      supply of inexpensive, used one-inch galvanized pipe.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, when I'd completed the system, I found that      I wasn't getting anywhere <em>near</em> the rated capacity      of the cylinder ... even in very high winds. I started      asking around and, sure enough, discovered that using      anything but a <em>genuine</em> sucker rod would add excess      weight ... overloading the mill and decreasing its output.      Simply stated, my galvanized pipe was too heavy.    </p>    <p>      At first, It seemed there was no choice except to buy the      "right" rod. However, used wind pumps are scarce, and new      parts are expensive ... so I decided to hold off a bit.    </p>    <p>      Then, on a trip to Oklahoma, I talked to an old farmer who      suggested that I mount a spring to help lift the pumping      rod in lighter breezes. He claimed that such a booster can      make a real difference in the amount of water a pump      supplies ... and I decided that it was worth a try.    </p>    <p>      To begin, I chose the biggest spring I could find: an old      garage door coil. Using an eyebolt, I connected one end of      the spring close to the top of the tower, and attached the      other end to my sucker rod substitute by means of an old      tailpipe clamp and a turnbuckle. The turnbuckle is      optional, since the spring tension can easily be adjusted      by moving the clamp up or down on the rod (see the      accompanying illustration).    </p>    <p>      The spring should be stretched out far enough to support      the weight of the sucker pipe ... thereby allowing the      energy your mill captures to lift <em>only</em> water. So,      in order to balance the spring's load, I disconnected my      makeshift rod from the gearbox by unbolting the jackshaft      from the sucker rod. Common sense told me that when the rod      dropped down, the spring was too loose ... and when the      pipe rose, the tension was too great. Once <em>no</em>      motion occurred, I figured I was all set.    </p>    <p>      Remember that it your pump has the normal eight-inch      stroke, you'll want a spring that-at rest-is at      least double that length, so it'll exert a more even force      through the stroke. (Garage door springs are usually      ideal.) Folks with exceptionally deep wells might want to      use <em>more</em> than one spring ... spacing them equally      around the tower to keep the rod centered.    </p>    <p>      Before I Installed a booster, my pump was producing      approximately three gallons per minute in a stiff breeze      ... but <em>with</em> the added spring attachment, my      system's per-minute flow has increased to four gallons!    </p>    <p>      It was an easy modification that certainly paid off for me,      and I'm sure other people with "make do" sucker rods on      their windpowered water pumpers will find this project to      be well worth the effort, too.    </p>
