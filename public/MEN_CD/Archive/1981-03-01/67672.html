Balliet    </h5>        <p>      Although most folks will agree that crisp summer salads      laced with mouthwatering slices of fresh-from-the-garden      cucumbers are among the high points of any hot season, many      gardeners don't <em>grow</em> the crisp treats. After all      (the argument often goes), cucumbers grow on vines that'll      gobble up cropping ground faster than a sweet-talking land      speculator can name a new development . . . so city people      - and even country dwellers with small garden plots      - can't <em>afford</em> to grow them, right?    </p>    <p>      Wrong. Happily, horticultural researchers have been      thinking of limited-space gardeners. And, with the      introduction of several varieties of "bush" cucumbers, a      new world has opened to aspiring growers who have a      shortage of gardening area.    </p>    <p>      Despite their name, such plants <em>don't</em> resemble      shrubs. Instead, their compact shape is formed by the      growth of extremely short vines that bear a profusion of      fullsized fruit. With the foliage of a mature plant      measuring only two to three feet across, bush cucumbers are      ideally suited to intensive gardening techniques . . .      whether in a raised bed or a patio pot.    </p>    <p>      And just how do you <em>grow</em> the "new" plants? Well,      the technique is about the same as that for      <em>conventional</em> cucumbers. The key element is to      remember that <em>all</em> members of this family are heavy      feeders: They need plenty of both organic material and      water and do best, therefore, in well-conditioned      humus-rich soil ... not too sandy, not too dense.    </p>        <p>      A well-prepared <em>organic</em> plot will definitely      encourage cuke production, by retaining moisture and      providing a uniform release of the required nutrients . . .      naturally. So work your garden area by tilling in a      generous dose of compost and organic fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      You can start the seeds indoors (or in a cold frame or      greenhouse) for an early crop, or simply plant them      outdoors after all danger of frost has passed. Don't rush      the season though . . . the warmth-loving kernels won't      germinate until the subsurface temperature exceeds      50Â°F.    </p>    <p>      After the cukes sprout, thin the seedlings to 12 or more      inches apart, and cultivate the plot often. Then, once the      fledgling plants have become established, mulch heavily.      (This last is a <em>must</em> practice . . . as it provides      for good moisture retention, slow nutrient release, and      weed and insect control.)    </p>    <p>      To container-grow your saladmakers, fill one or more pots      (seven inches or larger) with a rich soil mixture and sow      the seed as you would in the ground, thinning to one plant      per pot after germination. Then simply guard against the      same insect and disease problems that might occur in a      garden.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, most compact cuke varieties are relatively      disease-resistant. However, insects such as the striped or      spotted cucumber beetle cause damage - both as      chewers and as carriers of bacterial wilt - and      <em>must</em> be controlled. To protect your plants,      practice the time-tested organic methods of natural soil      maintenance, crop rotation, and heavy mulching. In      addition, try your most repulsive homebrewed hot pepper and      garlic spray on any insects that appear. (Or - as an      extreme measure - dust with pyrethrum or rotenone to      keep bugs at bay.) With reasonable care and some good      fortune, you should harvest an abundance of bright green,      slender fruits in about eight weeks.    </p>    <p>      And when's the best time to pick them? That's up to you.      Pluck anything from three-inch luncheon tidbits to      eight-inch candidates for the dill crock. (Never let the      cukes rot on the vine. Regular harvesting increases      production and helps prevent insect and disease problems.)    </p>    <p>      Give bush cucumbers a try this season . . . whether you're      cramped for space or not! Most major seed company catalogs      offer at least <em>one</em> of the several varieties      available. And whatever specific type you choose, you can      count on a lot of good eating from a <em>little</em> area!    </p>
