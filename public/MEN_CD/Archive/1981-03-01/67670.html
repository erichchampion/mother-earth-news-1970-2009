                <p>      <strong>For a delicious, traditional Easter dish that's      also great for snacking, treat yourself to . . .</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Bill and Diane Vargo    </h5>        <p>      Each year, we follow the custom of our Hungarian ancestors      by preparing sweet cheese for Easter. This traditional,      easy-tomake comestible (which requires no unusual      ingredients) is served with boiled ham, kielbasa (a      delicious smoked sausage), fresh Easter bread, boiled eggs,      and horseradish. It can also be enjoyed - with wheat      crackers - as an appetizing hors d'oeuvre or a      wholesome snack.    </p>    <h3>WHAT'S NECESSARY</h3>    <p>      To make sweet cheese, you will need 1-1/2 quarts of milk, 1      dozen eggs, 4 tablespoons of honey, 1/2 to 1 teaspoon of      salt, and a yard of cheesecloth (or a large, porous dish      towel). We sometimes add a handful of golden raisins and/or      dried currants, but such "surprises" are optional.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to beat the eggs, honey, and salt      together until they're well blended. When that's done, heat      up the milk in a large pan, stirring constantly, and      - when it comes to a boil - add the      egg/honey/salt mixture and <em>continue</em> to boil and      stir for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the mixture curdles      (it'll resemble yellow cottage cheese). At that point,      remove the pan from the heat and mix in dried fruits if      desired.    </p>        <h3>A GOURMET GLOBE</h3>    <p>      Next, fold the cheesecloth in half and then in half again,      to make a four-layered square of material. Place the cloth      in a colander and put the colander in a large bowl or pan.    </p>    <p>      Pour the curdled milk into the lined strainer, and then      pull the corners of the cheesecloth together, twisting      tightly and squeezing out as much liquid as you can while      forming the curds into a ball. Tie the "bag" shut with a      piece of string or a clean shoelace, and hang it (above a      bowl) overnight ... allowing the remaining liquid to drain      off and leave a nice, firm cheese globe. (You can chill the      leftover liquid and serve it as a rich eggnoglike -      but thin - drink.)    </p>    <p>      When you unwrap the cheese the following morning, store it      in the refrigerator in an airtight container to keep the      sphere fresh and moist till you're ready to eat it.    </p>    <p>      You may not be of Hungarian descent, but we bet that once      you try this Easter dish, sweet cheese will become a      tradition in your household, too.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: MOM's recipe testers found the cheese to      be easy to make and tasty. They also recommend      experimenting with the basic formula ... perhaps adding      other types of dried fruit, nuts, and so forth.</em>    </p>
