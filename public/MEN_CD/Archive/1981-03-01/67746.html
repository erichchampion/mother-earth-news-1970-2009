                <p>      <em>You can get into this profitable business with      practically no start-up capital!</em>    </p>             <h5 id="byline">     By John A. Hinz</h5>    <p>      If you live within commuting distance of a truck stop, you      could be in business for yourself-and making more      than $100 a day-within two weeks from <em>right      now</em> . How? Well, by taking advantage of <em>dirt!</em>    </p>    <p>      Trucks that travel 2,000 miles or more each week can get      downright filthy, and there's money to be made in      <em>cleaning</em> the dirty diesels. Furthermore, before      you get turned off by the thought of scrubbing down      behemoths that are 55 feet long and 13 feet high, consider      this: Most drivers will want to have just their      <em>tractors</em> washed ... not their trailers.    </p>    <p>      Many load-haulers (even the independents) switch trailers      regularly ... and the big, mechanized truck washes do a      pretty fair job of keeping the "boxes" clean, but      <em>not</em> the cabs. The fact of the matter is that an      entrepreneur who runs a "Tractors Only" business can stay      competitive with the "big guys" by lavishing special      attention on each vehicle.    </p>    <p>      Then, too, most 18-wheeler drivers take a lot of pride in      their equipment. In many cases, their trucks are virtually      their homes, and so the men and women want those traveling      dwellings to look <em>good</em> as they churn down the      freeway.    </p>    <h3>SELL YOUR SERVICE</h3>    <p>      To get started in this profitable enterprise, you'll first      have to make an appointment with the manager of your local      truck stop and do a little selling. Explain your concept,      and tell the boss that you <em>don't</em> want to set up as      an employee, but-instead-as an independent      contractor. Stress that you intend to be the <em>best</em>      struck washer on the interstate, and that <em>your</em>      reputation will increase his or her business. (It's true!      If drivers can get a top-notch wash job while they stop for      a bite to eat, they'll be more inclined to choose your      location ... regularly. ) If the manager is unwilling to      let you open up shop for no charge, perhaps you can work      out a rental arrangement covering space and water.    </p>    <p>      Once you and the truck stop operator are able to come to an      agreement, choose the exact location of your "wash rack"      carefully. The spot should be paved ... have good drainage      capabilities ... and-of course-be easily      accessible to the monstrous vehicles.    </p>    <h3>INEXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT</h3>    <p>      If you make a <em>small</em> investment in      equipment-right at the start-your job will be      easier and the <em>quality</em> of your work higher. First,      unless the truck stop provides it, you'll want to purchase      a good stout hose that's long enough to do the job. (A      garden hose <em>will</em> work, but it's likely to be      damaged the first time 37 tons of truck rolls over it!)      Also, be sure to get a trigger-controlled spray nozzle and      a good-sized bucket or two.    </p>    <p>      A couple of soft, fleecy "wash mitts" (available at auto      parts stored will be easier to use <em>and</em> more      durable than sponges. (To do a better job and prolong the      life of your mitts, use one for the worst of the gritty      dirt and reserve the other for followup work or less      severely soiled areas.    </p>    <p>      You'll need some kind of soap or detergent too. and my      experience has shown me that an ordinary dishwashing liquid      works as well as any of the more "exotic suds.    </p>    <p>      Finally, a soft-bristled brush with a long handle is      necessary to reach hard-to-get-at spots ... a tall      stepladder will be a lot of help ... and a good pair of      waterproof boots is almost mandatory.    </p>    <h3>THE ADDED TOUCH</h3>    <p>      You might also decide to offer a couple of extra services,      such as "degreasing" and interior cleaning. The former task      requires a small sprayer with a hand pump, and a supply of      kerosene to remove the grime and oil from wheels, exhaust      stacks, fuel tanks, engines, and frames. (Simply spray a      light coating of kerosene on the affected parts, and then      wash them with your regular detergent.)    </p>    <p>      If you (or an assistant) would like to earn extra cash by      doing interiors, get some window cleaner, plus a couple of      cans of furniture wax to use on the instrument panels and      upholstery. (Both Pledge and Behold work well, and either,      one can help remove stubborn, salty "white spots" on the      tractor's exterior, as well.)    </p>    <p>      After you've been working for a few weeks, you might find      it worthwhile to buy or rent a pressure washer. Many      hardware stores (and spray equipment supply outfits) will      lease-at low cost-machines that'll pump a water      and soap mixture at a pressure of about 200 pounds per      square inch. (A pressure setup won't allow you to      <em>forgo</em> handwork, but it <em>can</em> speed up the      whole washing process )    </p>    <h3>CONTENTING CUSTOMERS</h3>    <p>      It shouldn't take you long to learn how to clean a truck      well. First, drench the machine with clear water, to      prevent grit from scratching the paint as you work. Then      apply your degreaser, if nec essary (avoid getting it on      the glass)    </p>    <p>      Now shove your mitts and brush into the suds and go to it      ... working from the top to the bottom, and rinsing each      area <em>thoroughly</em> before the soap can dry. (You'll      soon discover that trucks help to control the summer insect      population. Bugs will often be plastered on the grilles and      bumpers. Getting them off is relatively easy if you use a      sponge wrapped in nylon mesh.)    </p>    <p>      Very few mechanized truck washes clean the <em>roof</em> of      the cab. So if you can get up there with your ladder and      brush, it'll be noticed-and appreciated-the      first time the driver runs into wet weather, since there'll      be no rooftop dirt streaming down his or her windows.    </p>    <p>      In order to attract and keep customers, you should try to      establish <em>regular</em> working hours. It's best to be      on the job during the early evening, since most drivers      like to take a break at that time. (Early morning Is fairly      slow, because many truckers are busy loading and unloading      then.) <em>Don't</em> try to wash in the dark, though, or      you'll miss too much. You won't be able to work when the      temperature drops below freezing, either, but heavy rubber      gloves <em>will</em> let you keep on cleaning in marginal      weather.    </p>    <p>      Once you've cultivated a few "regulars", you might want to      have one of them show you how to operate the big vehicles.      If you can learn to move the trucks around the parking lot,      your business will increase ... since drivers will be able      to leave their trucks, get some supper, and return to clean      machines. (But for heaven's sake, don't start jockeying the      beasts about until you know what you're doing! Even a minor      parking lot accident is likely to cause more grief than you      can imagine! )    </p>    <h3>THE PAY DIRT</h3>    <p>      How much can you earn as a truck washer? Well, you'll have      no trouble finding customers if you price your service      between $8.00 and $12.00 per tractor. (Those with the long      nose and hood are usually harder to wash than are cabovers,      so it might be smart to charge more for the "difficult"      types.) Then you should add $2.00 or $3.00 If you do any      <em>interior</em> work.    </p>    <p>      Once you've got the knack, you should have no trouble      washing two tractors per hour. It doesn't take a lot of      fancy math to figure out that an income of $100 a day is a      conservative estimate.    </p>    <p>      The most important thing to remember is to maintain the      <em>quality</em> of your work. If you can't do a better job      than the automated cleaners, you won't last long. Remember      that the CB radio spreads information fast. And, although      it's illegal to advertise your business over the airways,      truckers <em>do</em> talk ... and <em>one</em> dissatisfied      customer can put a crimp in your income to a real hurry.    </p>    <p>      In fact, I've found that I can assure a steady stream of      business by offering a guarantee. I let truckers know that      I won't <em>let</em> unhappy customers drive away, and that      I'll keep washing until they're satisfied. Try it yourself.      Before you know it, word will spread like chicken pox in a      second grade classroom... and the tractors will be lined up      and waiting!    </p>
