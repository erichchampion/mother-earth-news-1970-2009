                    <h2 id="subtitle">      America and the SUV    </h2>    <p>      U.S. automobiles release more carbon dioxide than the      nationwide energy-related emissions of all but four other      countries in the world and the immense popularity of      fuel-inefficient SUVs has dragged down the national average      fuel economy, now at a 23-year low. In the last seven      years, SUV sales have doubled and now account for 24      percent of all new vehicle sales. The average SUV still      pollutes 46 percent more than the average passenger car,      although some automakers, including Acura, BMW, Honda, and      Volvo, are installing better emissions controls on specific      models.    </p>    <p>      Contrary to popular belief, SUVs are not inherently safer      than cars because of their increased size. Many SUVs are      less stable than cars and provide poor occupant protection      in rollovers. In general, if you don't have an ongoing need      for large capacity, increased power or off-road ability,      you should avoid these vehicles. Here are five      recommendations if you do need an SUV.    </p>    <p>      1. Look for an SUV with better-than-average fuel economy.      Typically this means choosing a more compact model, rather      than a larger one.    </p>    <p>      2. Seek out SUVs with the cleanest emissions; some now meet      the Ultra-Low-Emission Vehicle standard. And a new set of      emission standards goes into effect with model year 2004.      Models that currently meet the "Tier 2 bin 5" standard,      such as the Acura MDX, Honda CR-V, Honda Element and Volvo      XC 90, have the lowest emissions among SUVs now on the      market.    </p>    <p>      3. Wait for forthcoming hybrid-electric SUVs. Over the next      few years, hybrid versions of the Ford Escape, Lexus RX      400H, Saturn VUE, Toyota Highlander and others are to be      released.    </p>    <p>      4. Don't drive solo: A cargo- and passenger-packed SUV uses      its fuel more efficiently than an empty one. This logic,      while applicable to all vehicles, is particularly important      for large-capacity SUVs and pickups.    </p>    <p>      5. Contact your senators and representatives and demand      higher fuel economy standards. A number of vehicle, engine      and transmission technologies exist that could improve SUV      fuel economies at modest costs.
