        CLOCKWISE FROM TOP: Charles Nystrom's latter-day cliff dwelling maintains the subtle earth tones common to the western Colorado environment. In fact, the massive chemney built by .... Chuck's brother Scott from rock removed during the blasting of the cave . . . Exposure to the cave's wall within the comfotable living space?along with a stone fireplace and wooden beams?helpt to maintain a feelin'of the home origins... The incredibly convoluted cross-bedding of the Mesozoic sandstone achieves textures unrivaled by human efforts... Chuck and his dog admire the wide open spaces.
