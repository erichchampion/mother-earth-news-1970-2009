                    <p>      High summer is here, and the garden basks in the shimmering      noonday heat. Dampen your shoes as you weed in the morning      dew, come to understand-once again-the      preciousness of water, and sniff the rich odor of the earth      after a late afternoon thunderstorm.    </p>    <p>      Then, while fireflies glimmer in the lengthening dusk and      the warm air is heavy with the scent of honeysuckle, give      thanks for the goodness of the land.    </p>    <h3>      Gleanings    </h3>    <p>      We'd much rather eliminate insecticide spraying entirely .      . but if you can't convince your community of the wisdom of      that course of action, insist on the use of a "drift      control agent". With such an additive, less wind-carried      pesticide will settle on your organic acres . . . and      25-50% smaller amounts of the dangerous chemicals will be      required. One such product, RAIN 200, is manufactured by      Landau Chemicals, Dept. TMEN, 750 Granby Lane, Co. lumbia,      South Carolina 29202.    </p>    <p>      If you're interested in the rapid expansion of the number      of farmers' markets, take a look at the fine new book by      Robert Sommer titled Farmers <em>Markets of</em> America: A      Renaissance. The publication can be ordered from Capra      Press, Dept. TMEN, 631 State Street, Santa Barbara,      California 93101 for $6.95 plus 75C postage and handling.    </p>    <h3>      The Second Season    </h3>    <p>      <em>Some of MOTHER's French Intensive beds are ready for a      second crop, while established plantings flourish in      others.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>As Cynthia Driscoll points out (in the article      beginning on page 64 of this issue), it's a shame to waste      an opportunity to have an autumn harvest . . . so here are      some crop suggestions for the vegetable garden's "second      season".</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broccoli:</strong> <em>If you've got the time, try      Cleopatra (75 days), a frost-resistant variety . . .      otherwise, grow Green Comet (55 days), which is the      earliest type available.</em> <strong>Beets:</strong>      <em>The people at Stokes warn that beets sown between July      15 and August 15 tend to become tough and stringy. If      you're planting either before or after that period,      however, try Stokes's Pacemaker ll (58 days) or Harris's      Warrior (57 days). Both of them have sugar beets in their      ancestry and superb flavor. Or, for an interesting change      of pace, you may want to grow Burpee's Golden Beet (55      days).</em> <strong>Bush beans:</strong> <em>For a really      quick crop, try Thompson ct: Morgan's Limelight (38 days).      Burpee's Tenderpod is an All-America winner that matures in      50 days, and Park's Contender gives a fine crop in 49      days.</em> <strong>Lettuce:</strong> <em>Buttercrunch is a      prime choice (75 days), or-if time is of the      essence-try Burpee's two short-season varieties .      .</em> <em>. Green lce</em> <em>(45 days) and Royal Oak      Leaf (50 days). Cauliflower: Go with a sure thing . . .      Snow Crown (53 days) is hardy and vigorous.</em>      <strong>Chinese cabbage:</strong> <em>Harris's Early Hybrid      G (50-60 days) is the best selection by far.</em>      <strong>Spinach and peas:</strong> <em>Early September may      be the best time for planting these vegetables in all but      the coldest sections of the country . . and most varieties      will mature in plenty of time.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>For the addresses of the seed companies mentioned, see      MOTHER NO. 61, page 174. (Copies are available-for      $3.00 plus $1.00 shipping and handling-from THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C.      28791.)</em>    </p>    <h3>      The Best of the Garden Societies    </h3>    <p>      Gardeners are gregarious folks, forever exchanging      experiences and advice. And sometimes a casual "back fence      seminar" can turn into something considerably more      permanent, by bringing people with common interests      together to share and learn from one another.    </p>    <p>      There are many gardening societies worldwide ... but two      "umbrella" organizations have become especially well-known:      the American Horticultural Society in the United States,      and the Royal Horticultural Society in England. Membership      in both organizations is open to all comers, and the      benefits of joining are <em>substantial.</em>    </p>    <p>      It costs $20 a year to become a member of the American      Horticultural Society (Mt. Vernon, Virginia 22121),      and-for that sum-you get six issues of <em>The      American Horticulturist . . . six</em> issues of the      Society's factpacked newsletter ... a discount on numerous      gardening books . . . a choice of five or six packets of      rare and unusual seeds from a list of over a hundred ...      access to the organization's information service . . .      <em>and</em> the chance to attend meetings as well as two      open houses a year.    </p>    <p>      The Royal Horticultural Society also welcomes American      members ("fellows" is the British term) for a subscription      of Â£10 a year-which equals about $23 at this writing,      but check the foreign exchange rates at your bank or in      your newspaper before sending in your duesand, while some      of the Society's benefits are limited to residents of the      British Isles (soil and manure analysis, fruit      identification, and garden inspections), you will receive      monthly copies of the association's journal, The      <em>Garden</em> ... tickets to the world-famous R.H.S.      Garden at Wisley and to the equally well known annual      Chelsea flower show (these make excellent presents to      British friends, as the benefits are transferable) ... and      up to 50 packets of seed each year (which you can select      from a list of over 1,000 varieties of trees <em>and</em>      flowers). Folks joining after June 1 can often "come      aboard" for half price, too! Write for information and an      application blank to The Secretary, The Royal Horticultural      Society, Vincent Square, London SW1P 2PE, England. A 31d      airmail stamp will speed your request on its way (sea mail      takes forever). If you pay for your membership with a      check, make sure that you add a dollar to the fee to help      pay the currency conversion costs.    </p>    <h3>      The Gardener's Bookshelf    </h3>    <p>      Two <em>gardening books of</em> note have recently come to      <em>ourattention. For Sunbelt hor</em> ticulturists, the      <em>Southern Living Gardening</em> volume, Trees &      Shrubs, is <em>a delight. Over</em> 350 warm-weather      <em>ground cov</em> ers, vines, <em>shrubs, and trees</em>      are <em>described and</em> pictured ... <em>and full</em>      cultural information is given for each one. At $17.95, the      <em>book</em> isn't <em>inexpen</em> sive ... but it would      make a <em>fine birthday or</em> Christmas present. It's      available at many <em>bookstores, or-for</em> the      list price plus $1.89 for <em>shipping</em> <em>and      handling-from Oxmoor</em> House, Dept <em>TMEN, P.O.      Box</em> 2463, <em>Birmingham, Alabama</em> 35201.    </p>    <p>      The <em>second work</em> is Duane <em>Newcomb's</em> The      Complete Vegetable Gardener's Sourcebook <em>(Avon,</em>      $9.95). This is quite <em>possibly</em> the best intro      <em>duction available</em> . . . and the <em>detailed      charts</em> of garden vegetable varieties alone are worth      the price.    </p>
