        <p>Mary Appelhol offers some good advice to tomato growers:</p><p>Many wholistic gardeners will-upon encountering a pest that's obviously in the process of dining on a "crop" plant-promptly pick the critter off and drown, "gish", or otherwise permanently dispose of it.</p><p>Most often, of course, such militant garden protection is the best policy. However, should you happen to espy a tomato hornworm that is covered with the white cocoons of the braconid wasp (like the crawler shown in Photo 1... as opposed to the healthy-and hungry-specimen in Photo 2), your best course of action is to leave the worm alone. It will soon die and dehydrate as a result of its parasites (as did the tomato-eater shown in Photo 3), and the wasp larvae will mature to lay more eggs on more of the pests that threaten to rob you of your hard-earned harvest!</p>
