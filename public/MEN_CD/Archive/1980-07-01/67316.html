            		        <h2 id="subtitle">      POISON PREVENTION AND TREATMENT AT HOME    </h2>    <p>      <em>In 1976, Tom Ferguson-then a fourth-year medical      student at Yale-launched a magazine called Medical      Self-Care</em> <em>... which-he hoped-would      serve as "a Whole Earth Catalog of the best medical books,      tools, and resources".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom spoke of his plans for the publication-and of      his conviction that self-care could raise the general level      of health in this country and lower our inflated levels of      medical spending-in the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER      NO. 51 ... and left no doubt that he would work toward      making those "dreams" come true.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson now, and the      medical self-care "movement"-as well as Tom's      magazine-has flourished. People are beginning to      assume more responsibility for their own well-being and are      eager for information that will help them take better care      of their bodies.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So-in an effort to provide just such very      necessary data-THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> offers as a      regular feature a piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D., entitled      (what else?) "Medical Self. Care".</em>    </p>    <p>      A substantial proportion of all accidents involving      children also involve poisons. But-according to the      National Poison Control Network-85% of all poisonings      can be effectively treated at home <em>...</em> if the      adults who are present just remain calm and understand a      few simple procedures.    </p>    <p>      First, it must be noted that by "poisons" I really mean      <em>suspected poisons</em> . Adults often jump to the      conclusion that children have been poisoned if the      youngsters are seen eating anything other than recognizable      food. The typical response-in such a case-is to      rush the child to an emergency room, where health workers      will usually induce vomiting. However, the suspect      substance sometimes turns out to be harmless <em>...</em>      and the fee for treatment becomes part of the estimated $30      million spent each year on unnecessary emergency room      visits. On the other hand, though, adults sometimes don't      become concerned when tots chew on painted toys,      houseplants, or newspapers. Yet some seemingly harmless      items can do serious damage!    </p>    <h3>      FATAL IRONY    </h3>    <p>      Dr. Richard Moriarty (who was, at the time, a pediatric      resident at Children's Hospital in Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania) once witnessed the death of a three-year-old      girl <em>...</em> the result of complications during      treatment for poisoning. It was later discovered that the      pills the girl had taken were not toxic, and that the      emergency room staff had not bothered to research the      substance before administering treatment.    </p>    <p>      The tragedy led Moriarty to establish a poison control      center in a converted bathroom at Children's Hospital.      Today, what started as a one-room office has expanded to      become the headquarters of the National Poison Control      Network (NPCN) <em>...</em> and it receives more than 200      calls a day! (Before Moriarty began his work, an average of      three Pittsburgh-area children under five years of      age died from accidental poisonings every year.      But-since the establishment of the center-no      child of this age group has died of poisoning in      Pittsburgh!)    </p>    <h3>      MR. YUK    </h3>    <p>      Since not every poison can be locked away (some      houseplants, for example, are quite toxic), Moriarty      encouraged parents to place stickers-illustrated with      the traditional "poison" symbol of skull and      crossbones-on all dangerous items. Frequently,      though, the warnings weren't heeded. So the doctor asked      preschoolers how they felt about the skull and crossbones,      and discovered that small fry are attracted to the      symbol... because pirate cartoons and the like have led      them to associate it with having fun.    </p>    <p>      Moriarty then developed a symbol that did turn youngsters      off: a scowling, phosphorescent green face sticking out its      tongue. One little girl looked at the face and said,      "That's yukky!" So the symbol was christened Mr. Yuk,      and-since 1972- more than 25 million Mr. Yuk      stickers have been distributed in the Pittsburgh area      alone.    </p>    <h3>      PREVENTIVE MEASURES YOU CAN TAKE    </h3>    <p>      [1] Label all household poisons with Mr. Yuk stickers      (available through order forms contained in the Poison      Safeguard Kit described below). Tell your children what      you're doing and <em>why</em> you're doing it. Common      dangerous household poisons include aspirin and other      medications, laundry detergents and bleaches, cleaning      agents, shampoos and shaving cream, insecticides, and      suntan lotion.    </p>    <p>      [2] Supervise your children closely right before mealtime.      A substantial proportion of accidental poisonings occur      when youngsters are hungry.    </p>    <p>      [3] Post the telephone number of the nearest Poison Control      Center beside your phone. Local centers are usually listed      inside the cover or in the white pages of the phone book.      If you don't find such a listing, send a self-addressed,      stamped envelope to the National Poison Control Network      (Children's Hospital, 125 De Soto Street, Pittsburgh,      Pennsylvania 15213) and ask for the number of the center      closest to you. Do it <em>now . . before</em> you actually      need assistance. (If an emergency strikes in the meantime,      though, you <em>can</em> telephone the Pittsburgh center      directly at 412/681-6669.)    </p>    <p>      [4] Buy a Poison Antidote Slideguide and/or a Poison      Safeguard Kit. The Slideguide is an uncomplicated cardboard      wheel. You simply turn a disk to the code number assigned      to a given poison, and a home antidote or other      instructions appear in a window marked "Procedures". The      device is available for $3.50 plus $1.00 postage from Dunn      and Reidman, Dept. TMEN, Box 241, Pacific Palisades,      California 90272 (213/459-5374).    </p>    <p>      The Poison Safeguard Kit was developed in conjunction with      Dr. Moriarty's National Poison Control Network. It contains      order forms for Mr. Yuk stickers, the telephone numbers of      every Poison Control Center in the United States, poison      education information, two bottles of syrup of ipecac to      induce vomiting, and a bottle of activated charcoal (which      is a useful antidote in many instances). The kit can be      ordered for $6.95 plus 50 cents postage from Marshall      Electronics, Dept. TMEN, 7440 North Long Avenue, Skokie,      Illinois 60077 (312/583-6060).    </p>    <h3>      IF POISONING OCCURS...    </h3>    <p>      Don't panic and <em>DO NOT</em> immediately reach for the      ipecac. Treatment may not be necessary, or ipecac may be      the <em>wrong</em> substance to use.    </p>    <p>      First and foremost, <em>call your local Poison Control      Center.</em> Identify the suspected poison to the staff      person and wait for instructions. (Let the adviser know      whether you have ipecac and/or activated charcoal on hand,      but <em>don't</em> use either unless instructed to do so.)    </p>    <p>      If you're told to use ipecac, give one tablespoon, followed      by a tall glass (8-16 ounces) of any fluid except milk.      Vomiting should take place in about 15 minutes. If it has      not occurred within about 20 minutes, give another      tablespoon of ipecac <em>...</em> but no more.    </p>    <p>      Ipecac should <em>not</em> be administered at home if the      victim is less than one year old <em>...</em> if the poison      is a corrosive: lye, drain or oven cleaner, or dishwashing      detergent... if the poison is a petroleum product:      kerosene, gasoline, paint thinner, or furniture polish      <em>...</em> or if the victim is either unconscious or      convulsing.    </p>    <p>      Such serious situations usually warrant a speedy trip to      the nearest emergency room, but do call the Poison Control      Center first.    </p>    <h3>      DO IT NOW    </h3>    <p>      Poisonproofing your home should take no more than an hour      or two. If you have young children, right now is the time      to:    </p>    <p>      [a] Lock poisons away in a secure place.<br />      <br />      [b] Use the Mr. Yuk stickers on substances that can't be      locked away.<br />      <br />      [c] Send away for your Poison Safeguard Kit.<br />      <br />      [d] Post near your telephone the number of the closest      Poison Control Center.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: You can subscribe to Dr. Tom Ferguson's      quarterly magzaine,</em> Medical Self-Care, <em>for $10 per      year.
