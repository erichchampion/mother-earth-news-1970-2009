                    <p>      <strong>This may be the best start-on-a-shoestring business      that MOTHER has ever featured! What other self-employment      venture do you know of that you can get into for only      $2,500 . . . yet which-right from the      start!-can net you $700 or more a week?</strong>    </p>    <p>      How would you like to own your own business, set your own      hours, wear a top hat to work, become something of a      mystical figure in your community, perform a necessary and      much-needed service . . . <em>and clear $700 or more a      week?</em> Well, chimney sweeps all over the country are      doing just that, and the ones that MOTHER has talked to      love every minute of it.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER staffers J. Weiland and Travis Brock, for example,      recently watched Steve Curtis clean chimneys in Connecticut      for four hours . . . and pocket a whopping $140 for his      morning's work (Steve is averaging a gross of $1,000 a week      and he's booked ahead for a month and a half). Another      sweep in Mississippi had already chalked up 1977 earnings      of $14,000 ($3,000 during the first 21 days of that month      alone) when Travis talked to him late in October. Yet a      third sweep in Michigan, who told Brock he "just works at      it part time," is taking home an easy $300 to $400 a week.    </p>    <p>      In fact, the <em>worst possible</em> case that Travis was      able to track down was a guy who lived in a remote section      of Montana (there are only 11,000 people in his whole      county) who charged less than recommended rates for his      services, only cleaned about 12 to 16 chimneys a month on a      very, very part-time basis . . . and who still was netting      (for less than one full day's work) a respectable $100 a      week. There just doesn't seem to be any way to fail in this      business!    </p>    <h3>CHIMNEY SWEEPS OF<br />COURSE,      SWEEP CHIMNEYS</h3>    <p>      Just what the heck do chimney sweeps do to earn that kind      of money? They clean chimneys. Six to eight a day in the      case of full-time sweeps . . . while part-timers generally      average-two-or-three-an-evening plus a few more on the      weekends. When you figure that most of the sweeps charge      $40 for cleaning the first chimney on a job and $30 more      for each additional one, it's easy to see how those dollars      can add up. (During the four hours that Weiland and Brock      followed Steve Curtis around, for instance, Steve cleaned      one chimney on one house and three on another . . . for a      total billing-$40 plus $40 plus $30 plus $30-of      $140.)    </p>    <h3>BUT WHY?</h3>    <p>      And why would anyone fork over forty or more bucks to have      some character in a black suit and top hat clean his or her      chimney? That question can be answered with one word:      SAFETY.    </p>    <p>      When solid fuels such as coal and wood are burned in a      furnace, stove, or fireplace they-as we all      know-give off welcome amounts of heat.      However-as many of us do not know-those same      two solid fuels also give off unwelcome amounts of two      by-products: soot and creosote. And, unless a chimney is      cleaned regularly, that highly flammable soot and creosote      will accumulate in the flue. Where it hangs-like some      fiendish fire bomb-just waiting for a chance spark to      ignite it.    </p>    <p>      If the homeowner is lucky, the resulting roaring blaze will      merely burn the chimney clean while filling the house with      the fire's loud and extremely unnerving howls. If he's not      so lucky, the unwanted fire will cremate the flue's lining      and dangerously weaken the chimney. And if he's downright      unfortunate, the flames will takeout the whole chimney . .      . and the rest of the house along with it.    </p>    <p>      All in all there were over 40,000 chimney fires in the      United States last year and, according to the National Fire      Protection Association, those fires caused more than $23      <em>million</em> worth of damage. That's a loss of $23      million which could have been prevented if every owner of a      coal- or wood-burning fireplace, furnace or stove had only      understood the importance of keeping the unit's chimney      clean.    </p>    <h3>THE PLOT THICKENS</h3>    <p>      There was, of course, a time-back when nearly      everyone on this continent heated his or her home with      either a wood or a coal-burner-that virtually      everyone in North America was well aware of the havoc a      chimney fire could wreak. Or, to put it another way,      great-grandpa and great-grandma most certainly knew the      value of keeping their chimneys clean . . . if they hadn't      suffered one or more unexpected blazes themselves, they'd      probably seen several neighbors and/or relatives burned out      of house and home on a frigid winter's night.    </p>    <p>      But then history took a strange double twist.      First-beginning right after World War II-the      United States and Canada made almost a complete switch in      the way the two nations heated their homes. Within just 25      to 30 years, nearly the entire population of this continent      dropped "dirty, troublesome" coal and wood . . . in favor      of "clean, convenient" natural gas, oil, and electricity.      And second-just when the major portion of North      America's old coal- and woodburning expertise had been      forgotten-the "energy crisis" of the 70's suddenly      forced a whole new generation, by the millions, to burn      wood and coal once again.    </p>    <p>      Thanks to this quirk in our recent history, we now are      surrounded by what must already be tens of millions of      people who are at least supplementally heating their homes      with solid fuel for the first time. And they are destined      to be joined by further tens of millions of first-time coal      and wood users in the years ahead. And a heck of a      percentage of all those folks [a] have absolutely no      inkling of the time bombs that already are building      up-and will continue to build up-in their      chimneys and [b] have no immediate past generation with the      proper firsthand experience to warn them about the ravages      of flue fires.    </p>    <h3>WHICH OPENS UP ONE HECK<br />OF      AN OPPORTUNITY . . . .</h3>    <p>      We can draw at least three conclusions from this short      history lesson:    </p>    <p>      [1] Since it now seems obvious that the "convenient" ways      of heating a house-with natural gas, oil, and      electricity-are going to continue getting more and more      expensive as time goes on . . . it seems just as obvious      that more and more families in the United States will      continue making the switch back to heating with coal and      wood in the years to come.    </p>    <p>      [2] Which means-whether they know it yet or not, and      more and more people are discovering the fact every      day-that an increasingly large percentage of this      continent's population is destined to live with a steadily      increasing risk of fires in their flues.    </p>    <p>      [3] Which just as surely means that anyone who can nip this      growing danger in the bud is suddenly going to become very,      very popular and is going to be very well rewarded starting      now and continuing throughout the years ahead .    </p>    <h3>. . . FOR CHIMNEY SWEEPS!</h3>    <p>      And who is the most logical candidate to cash in on this      burgeoning new demand? Who is the "anyone" most likely to      become well rewarded for nipping the danger of flue fires      in the bud? Why, a brand-new version of that fine old      almost-mythical-character-of European folklore . . . the      chimney sweep. That's who!    </p>    <p>      And that's also exactly how today's new breed of sweep is      bursting upon the scene . . . as a black suited, top      hatted, dancing-on-the-roof reincarnation of the character      Dick Van Dyke played in the movie, Mary Poppins. Or, to put      it another way, as a modern-day version of the traditional      19th century European chimney sweep.    </p>    <p>      Laugh at this showmanship if you like, but the sweeps      who've tried it recently here in the U.S. and Canada have      found that the legendary "top hat and tails" outfit of      their trade has rocketed them to success overnight. As one      of the new and very dedicated young men in the trade says:    </p>    <p>      "By re-creating the image of a 19th century sweep, we      accomplish several important things. [1] We grab people's      attention, thereby making it easier for us to tell them      about the dangers of chimney fires. [2] We grab the media's      attention, and the newspaper stories and TV features which      result both help us spread the word about the hazard of      flue fires and just incidentally, makes our business grow      by leaps and bounds. [3] Our image puts a little fun back      into life. Stop and think. Who would you rather have clean      your chimney: a 20th century serviceman wearing white      coveralls and a baseball cap . . . or a 19th century      <em>tradesman</em> dressed up in top hat and tails? Hell,      I've even had grown men go out of their way to shake my      hand and pretty girls give me a kiss-just like something      out of <em>Mary</em> <em>Poppins</em> -when they see      my outfit. And [4] this simple little bit of imagery all      adds up to a more lucrative operation for us. We attract      people's attention, they feel good having us do a job for      them, and-instead of begrudging us a reasonable fee      for our services-they usually seem downright happy to      pay for our work."    </p>    <h3>GOOD SWEEPS<br />DELIVER THE      GOODS</h3>    <p>      That same young man-and every other "new breed"      chimney sweep worthy of the name-is also quick to      point out that his "top hat and tails" image is just that.      An image. Frosting on the cake. Gilding on the lily. A lot      of fun as far as it goes . . . but nothing in any way that      should be considered a substitute for doing an important      and worthwhile job in a craftsmanlike and highly      professional manner.    </p>    <p>      Which is not the same as saying that all chimney      sweeps-or even any two!-see eye to eye on just      how that task should be accomplished. The job itself      (breaking loose and scrubbing out every particle of soot      and creosote that can possibly be removed from a flue),      they agree on. Ask any three sweeps the best way to      accomplish this specific objective, however, and you're      sure to get at least four adamant opinions on square      brushes versus round, hard brushes versus soft, long      brushes versus short, weighted brushes versus unweighted,      sweeping from the bottom of a chimney to the top versus the      other way around, and the same kind of pros and cons about      at least 5,000 other finer points of the chimney sweep's      art.    </p>    <p>      All good chimney sweeps, then, do a good job of sweeping      chimneys . . . and they do it without letting any of the      crud get out into their clients' houses. No two chimney      sweeps, though, seem to accomplish that objective in      exactly the same way.    </p>    <h3>THE HEIGHT OF TECHNOLOGY</h3>    <p>      A far more advanced method of sweeping      chimneys-perhaps the most advanced in the      world-is the one developed by Tom Risch of Westport,      Connecticut. Tom calls it the "August West System"      and-for $1,385-will I sell you a complete      package of the tools you'll need to make it work. (And,      yes, Risch's package does include atop hat.)    </p>    <p>      One of the key elements of the August West System is a      highly specialized high-volume vacuum cleaner called a      "soot sweeper." Don't underestimate this piece of      equipment. It is <em>not</em> merely a heavy-duty shop vac      (which moves, maybe, 90 cubic feet of air a minute). This      compact monster moves <em>700</em> cubic feet of air per      minute . . . which is about eight or ten times the capacity      of your average house vacuum sweeper. But that's the kind      of air-moving muscle you need if you really want to keep a      cascade of soot out of your clients' homes and out of your      lungs. Nothing less will do.    </p>    <p>      A second key part of the August West Chimney Sweeping      System is a set of specially developed fiberglass cleaning      rods. These rods snap together with "quick disconnects"      similar to the connectors on air-powered tools. And they're      constructed of a mixture of fibers and resins and held to a      diameter which makes them just flexible enough to bend      around smoke shelves . . . but still rigid enough to poke a      brush all the way up a chimney. The construction of the      rods, furthermore, has been shrewdly calculated to make      them tough and highly resistant to fractures. In the      unlikely event of a break, however, the formulation of the      rods' resin/fiber mixture and cure was designed to make the      snap-together extensions splinter apart (like-a-green tree      limb) rather than snap off clean (leaving a brush stuck in      a flue somewhere). In short-just as with the August      West soot sweeper-there's far more to the AW cleaning      rods than meets the eye.    </p>    <p>      And there's far more to the August West profit picture than      meets the eye too, thanks to the special gear just      described. Because those rods and that soot sweeper make it      possible, in most cases, for <em>one</em> man or woman      (instead of two) to clean a flue or chimney entirely from      the bottom (without ever getting upon the roof) . . . and      do the whole job in a fast half hour (instead of the hour      or hour and a half required by more traditional methods).    </p>    <p>      Steve Curtis-the personable young fellow whom Wetland      and Brock watched pocket $140 for four hours work one day      last fall-uses the August West System.    </p>    <p>      First Steve spreads a painter's drop cloth in front of the      hearth, positions the end of his soot sweeper's inlet hose      in the back of the fireplace, and turns the "dust sucker"      on. He then reaches up into the fireplace's throat and      removes the damper    </p>    <p>      Next Curtis chooses the proper-sized brush, snaps it onto a      Flexi-rod, and pushes the brush up into the flue. More rods      are snapped onto the first one and fed up into the chimney      until, finally, the brush pops out the top of the stack.      Steve then scrubs the flue from the top down . . . while he      remains conveniently and safely indoors at the base of the      chimney.    </p>    <p>      With every stroke of the brush, of course, a cascade of      ashes and soot plummets into the fireplace. No problem. As      fast as the black dust billows up . . . the soot sweeper      sucks it away. Believe it or not, the system works so well      that we couldn't even get a sequence of photographs showing      how well this method of controlling an otherwise messy      situation operates! There just wasn't anything to show!    </p>    <p>      Once the flue has been thoroughly cleaned, Curtis uses a      smaller brush to spiff up the smoke chamber and smoke      shelf. All the fine, airborne dust-as you've probably      guessed-continues to disappear into the soot sweeper      . . . while Steve shovels everything else into paper      shopping bags. ("Don't use plastic garbage bags," Curtis      says. "Because of their static electricity charges, soot      sticks to the outside of the plastic sacks . . . and then      falls off on your client's rug when you move them.")    </p>    <p>      If it sounds as if the August West System has chimney      cleaning down to a science . . . well, it does. Using the      AW streamlined method of swabbing out a flue, Steve Curtis      can set up, clean a chimney, pack up, and be on his way to      another job . . . all in 30 minutes or less. Which ain't a      bad way to earn forty bucks.    </p>    <h3>THE OTHER SIDE<br />>OF THE      BUSINESS</h3>    <p>      If the pay can be good, it should also be pointed out that      sweeping chimneys-even with the August West      System-ain't exactly a desk job. Cleaning flues-no      matter how you slice it-still calls for a certain      amount of physical activity . . . and Steve Curtis honestly      earns every nickel that he's paid.    </p>    <p>      Nor is this an occupation that you can work at carelessly.      A sweep in Washington State, for instance, recently broke      his shoulder when a new extension ladder malfunctioned and      dumped him on the ground. Then too, slovenly flue cleaners      soon learn that customers can get very rate about soot      tracked across rugs . . . and that the negligent breathing      of the same soot can be exceedingly hazardous to the lungs.    </p>    <p>      In general, though, these risks of the trade are no risk at      all to the careful and prudent chimney sweep. Just as the      highly publicized "trade disease" of sweeps in the      1800's-skin cancer-presents no out-of-the-ordinary      danger to anyone in the business who'll make regular use of      soap and water.    </p>    <p>      (In the "old" days, sweeps used to climb right down into      chimneys to clean them. Naturally, this coated them from      head to toe with creosote and soot. The problem was then      further compounded by the fact that most people bathed only      infrequently in Europe in those days . . . and chimney      sweeps sometimes didn't bathe at all! End result: a high      incidence of skin cancer-especially cancer of the      scrotum-among chimney sweeps. Which is unfortunate, since      we now know that the disease could have been prevented by      higher standards of hygiene.)    </p>    <h3>TO SUM UP, THEN. . . .</h3>    <p>      Sweeping chimneys may not exactly be a "lazy man's way to      riches" . . . but the pay is exceptional, the demand is      steadily growing for this particular service once again,      and new equipment now makes the job far easier and safer      than ever before. Perhaps best of all, this most definitely      is one of those "dream" businesses that so many of us are      always looking for: a business with flexible hours and very      low overhead that requires less initial investment (figure,      at most, $2,000 to get started with August West) than you      can earn back in just two full weeks of work.    </p>    <p>      This may-all things considered-be the best      start-on-a-shoestring enterprise that MOTHER has ever      featured . . . and we're gonna be mighty surprised if a      hundred or more readers of this magazine don't eventually      wind up as $1,000-a week chimney sweeps. Be sure to let us      know if you're one of the hundred!    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>Update on chimney sweeping . .      .</strong></em><br />    </p>    <h3>THEM THAT'S DOING. . .</h3>    <p>      We called Paul Biskner to find out more about this sweep      who made $530.00 in one day, and here's what we found:    </p>    <p>      Hello. This is Paul. Right now I'm buried in soot from head      to toe, but please wait. When you hear the tone, please      feel free to leave your name your telephone number and      message and I'll be glad to get back to you as soon as I      can. Sweeps luck, and thank you for calling Paul Glass      Chimney Sweeps.    </p>    <p>      That's right. A simple telephone answering machine, which      couldn't cost more than a few dollars a week to operate,      holds down the fort while Paul and his pretty wife Barbera      are out earning the bread.    </p>    <p>      The Biskners are the perfect bootstrap couple. They bought      the August West System for $1385, had a logo done up and      painted on their van, and headed right out to the county      fair to drum up business. They're now doing so well that      we're not even printing how much they brought in this year.      But, we assure you, it's a lot more than the $18,000 Paul      brings in as a firefighter. That's right! Paul and Barbera      are doing this PART-TIME. They love what they're doing and      swear by the August West System.    </p>    <p>      "It's kind of dirty work, but I don't mind since I really      believe in what I'm doing," says Barbera whose sky-blue      eyes look even bluer against her soot-covered face.    </p>    <p>      Paul just returned from lecturing on Fire Safety at the      August West Convention. He added, "There's a great deal of      personal satisfaction in helping others protect their lives      from fire hazards. It really makes you feel great! And as      wood-burning consultants, there are plenty of questions to      answer and lots of advice to give."    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to be part of this growing network of sweeps      across the country who use the August West System, call or      write today. As more and more people burn more and more      wood, the potential is mind boggling.    </p>
