                    <p>      <strong>A delectable dinner may be as close as the nearest      pond or stream!</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by LINDA WEISSINGER    </h5>    <p>      One of my earliest little-girl memories is of going with my      dad and brothers to catch snapping turtles in the muddy      Auglaize River near Wapakoneta, Ohio. The rugged,      hook-jawed beasts-once pulled ashore and      cleaned-would be cooked into a big pot of turtle soup      or fried to a golden brown in a sizzling hot skillet.    </p>    <p>      This abundant-and practically free-source of      delicious protein can be found in almost any body of fresh      water in eastern North America. And though snappers      <em>look</em> mean, they're a cinch to catch and-      <em>if you</em> know what you're doing-easy to      handle.    </p>    <p>      Foraging for the wild meat can be a <em>profitable</em>      business, too! One of my nephews sells uncleaned snappers      for over 50 cents a pound, and a single catch can net him      an average of $7.50. Then there are folks (such as Noble      Isley of Disko, Indiana), who make their living as turtle      hunters and wholesalers. Isley sells dressed meat for $2.50      a pound, and he regularly supplies the product to large      turtle fries . . . which are becoming very popular at      Legion halls, union gatherings, and friendly neighborhood      hangouts in the Midwest.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT MAKES IT A SNAPPER?    </h3>    <p>      Like its relatives, this tastiest of turtles (which bears      the Latin name, <em>Chelydra serpentina</em> ) does have      four legs, a head, and a tail sticking out from under a      shell . . . but it's pretty easy to distinguish snappers      from their less feisty kin: Imagine a street fighter at a      ladies' tea party, and you have about the right amount of      contrast.    </p>    <p>      A snapper's shell is a dull (often mossy and algae-covered)      piece of armor without any bright spots or markings, and      neither the turtle's head nor its tail can ever completely      retract into the protective carapace. The reptile's front      legs are unusually quick and flexible, and a snapper can      flip from its back to a traveling position in no time at      all. Its yellow feet are tipped by claws as sharp as its      eyes, and its jaws-supported by a thick,      weightlifter's neck- <em>can amputate a finger      easily</em> . . . so be warned!    </p>    <p>      The snapper's Achilles' heel, however, is its tail! Grab it      . . . hold the creature well away from your body . . . and      you'll render this reptilian cousin of "Jaws" almost as      harmless as a bucket of water.    </p>    <p>      Most snapping turtles have top shells that are about a foot      long and 8 to 10 inches wide. The snappers we hook usually      weigh between 10 and 20 pounds . . . but 35-pounders are      not unheard of, and very old turtles (zoologists guess the      maximum age to be between 80 and 100 years) may tip the      scales at 50 to 60 pounds. (A cousin of the common snapping      turtle, the "Alligator Snapper", is found in the lower      Mississippi and its bayous. These big fellows may weigh as      much as 140 pounds, and I don't recommend that any but the      most experienced turtle hunters tangle with them.)    </p>    <p>      Snappers hibernate all winter, so you won't see the      formidable beasts during the cold months. Come spring,      though, they can be found in swamps, wetlands, muddy areas      of streams or lakes, and even in drainage ditches. They      often wait in muskrat holes for prey, and will scour creek      bottoms for tasty morsels. The carnivorous scavengers live      on insects, fish, birds (including ducklings), and any      carrion found in their environment. And, even though      turtles breathe air, they must <em>swallow</em> their food      underwater. (Therefore, if you become affectionately      attached to a snapping turtle, make sure your pet's new      home has sufficient water to allow the reptile to      submerge.)    </p>    <h3>      INEXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT    </h3>    <p>      I guess the methods of catching snappers are as different      as are the people who employ them. The previously mentioned      Isley family tell me that they just boat slowly over a      lake, trailing a stringerful of fish. A      partner-swimming in scuba gear-follows, and      when he sees his prey going for the fish, he quietly swims      up behind the snapper and flips it into the boat. The      Isleys claim they catch hundreds of pounds of turtles in      this way.    </p>    <p>      A second, more ordinary technique is simply to use turtle      traps. These wooden frames covered with chicken wire are      usually rectangular in shape and measure about 2' X 2' X      4'. One-way openings at both ends allow the turtle to enter      the snare and eat the bait, but not to exit. (A hinged lid      on the top of the trap gives the hunter easy access to the      catch.)    </p>    <p>      The turtle trap must be lowered under the water . . .      fastened by its rope to a convenient tree or stake . . .      and left until a snapper is caught (or until small fish or      crayfish eat all the bait). Traps are handy for folks whose      property borders a stream, but they can be less than      pleasant to deal with if you have to load the contraptions      into your pickup and cart them all over the countryside.    </p>    <p>      Probably the easiest and most <em>inexpensive</em> "turtle      tricker" is a plain old hook and line. Such a rig can be      rolled up to fit in your pocket, and should cost less than      a dollar. It can be used in almost any depth of water,      and-if put in the right spot-it's almost      guaranteed to bring home some meat for the stewpot.    </p>    <p>      A turtle hook looks like a large fishhook, and is generally      at least one-half inch from the barb across to the shank.      The line should be an extremely stout cord (most fishing      line won't be strong enough, and could easily cut your      fingers if used to pull in a heavy turtle). Make sure the      hook is <em>securely</em> fastened to the free end of the      line . . . and to keep your cord untangled, wrap it around      a stick or an empty tin can.    </p>    <p>      An even simpler rig is a two-foot length of 3/16" nylon      cord tied to a discarded plastic jug at one end and to a      short steel leader with a heavy hook attached at the other.      Just float it-baited-in any likely looking spot      overnight. (You can secure the jug to a tree on the bank,      but a turtle will usually come in close to shore when it      finds itself hooked, so such an anchor isn't really      necessary.)    </p>    <h3>      THE BEST IN BAIT    </h3>    <p>      Bloody chunks of beef, such as neck bones or oxtails, are      about the best snapper bait. Cut them into pieces      approximately 1-1/2 inches long, and secure the meat firmly      on the hook. (If you just gently "drape" the bait over your      barb, you'll be surprised later at the hook's singular      cleanliness . . . and <em>turtlelessness</em> !)    </p>    <p>      Friends of ours prefer to lure the turtles with dead fish,      and they keep small "headson" perch in the freezer for this      purpose. (Others-folks who supplement their incomes      by trapping fur-bearing animals-like to use muskrat      meat.)    </p>    <p>      Since turtles are night feeders, it's best to wait until      evening to set your line. The prime spots are the muddy and      slow areas in a river . . . places along a bank where some      obstruction (such as a fallen tree) enters the water . . .      or most anywhere in a creek with lots of sloping banks and      potholes. If you scan the water carefully, you may see a      turtle head or two poking up, and you'll know you're near      success.    </p>    <p>      Check your hook early the following morning if you've      snared a turtle, pull it out of the water carefully,      keeping the critter a good distance from your body . . .      then grab its tail and put it in your bucket or basket. (Be      aware that turtles are much more aggressive on land than in      the water!)    </p>    <p>      Before you take your snapper home, sprinkle or cover it      with water. Remember, too, that turtles can't tolerate long      periods in the hot sun, so keep your catch in a cool, shady      spot . . . preferably in a covered container, such as a      garbage can. As long as it's sitting in a few inches of      water, the reptile will be fine for several days . . . but      if you plan to keep a snapper for a week or more, you      should feed it to be sure it stays alive.    </p>    <h3>      THE CLEANUP    </h3>    <p>      Cleaning a snapping turtle-if you don't know how to      do it-can be almost as difficult as peeling an      armored tank. If you follow my procedures, however, you'll      find it to be a fairly simple task . . . one that can be      accomplished in less than half an hour.    </p>    <p>      The first step is to cut off the snapper's head. If the      hook is still in its mouth, you can put a foot on the shell      and use the line to pull the head as far out as possible.      Otherwise, gently tickle its mouth with a stick,      and-when the turtle snaps at this prod-quickly      grasp the outstretched neck with a pair of pliers . . .      give the turtle a sharp rap on the nose with a piece of      hardwood to anesthetize it . . . and cut through the thick      (and often surprisingly long) neck with a sharp knife.      (Again, methods vary. My neighbor uses a chopping block and      an axe.) Bear in mind, though, that reflex action keeps a      turtle's jaws and claws active long after they've been      severed . . . so put any such cutoff members out of reach      of children and family pets.    </p>    <p>      Now you can tie a stout cord to the tail and hang the      turtle from a tree limb or clothesline to drain the blood      from the carcass. This will take 10-15 minutes, though some      folks prefer to let turtles hang overnight. (Actually, this      step may be omitted altogether, but it makes the rest of      the cleaning chore less bloody.)    </p>    <p>      Next, put the headless, bloodless carcass on its back,      and-with a sharp knife-cut between the shells      and lift off the bottom one. Remove the entrails from the      top shell. Next, skin the legs, neck, and tail . . . then      cut these from the body and put them in a pan of cold      water. Finally, you'll see two nice pieces of meat attached      to the inside of the top shell. Break off the few small      bones covering these chunks, and remove them also. (Snapper      <em>shells</em> , once they're cleaned and dried, make      unusual dishes or baskets. I used one this past fall in a      flower show, and the result was spectacular!)    </p>    <h3>      OLD FAMILY KNOW-HOW    </h3>    <p>      Turtles are reputed to have seven different types of meat,      though I must admit I've never been able to discern the      various flavors . . . other than noting that-like      chicken-some of the flesh is light and the rest dark.      I do know some delightful ways to prepare this foraged      delicacy, however.    </p>    <p>      The following two recipes have been enjoyed in my family      for years . . . and I can guarantee that they'll add a      little "wild" variety to your normal dining fare.    </p>    <p>      To make a hearty turtle soup, boil your skinned turtle      sections until the meat can be removed easily from the      bones. (This step will take about an hour in a pressure      cooker.)    </p>    <p>      At that point, pick off the meat, discard the bones, and      save the broth. Now-in a 10-quart      kettle-combine the meat and broth with 1/2 of a small      cabbage head, 1 cup of corn, 1 cup of peas, 1 cup of green      or navy beans, 3 carrots, 3 stalks of celery, 6 potatoes,      the juice from 1 lemon, 1 diced onion, and 1 quart of      tomatoes (or tomato juice).    </p>    <p>      When the vegetables have been simmered until they're      tender, stir in 3 tablespoons of browned flour, 1 cup of      uncooked noodles, 2 diced hard-boiled eggs, and salt and      pepper to taste . . . and cook the dish for another 10      minutes.    </p>    <p>      Then put 1 teaspoon of pickling spice (it's on the herb      shelf in most grocery stores) in a small muslin bag. Tie      the cloth tightly, drop it into the soup, let the pot      simmer for five minutes more, then remove the bag promptly.    </p>    <p>      At this point, the soup is done and can be served at once.      Some folks, however, prefer to let the treat slow-cook for      12 to 24 hours. Whatever your preference, be sure to freeze      any leftovers for a quick meal after a busy day.    </p>    <p>      Fried turtle is another favorite around our house. Small      snappers, between 5 and 10 pounds, are best for this      purpose. Bigger turtles can also be cooked in a skillet,      but will "chew" much better if they're finished-until      tender-in an oven.    </p>    <p>      To make this dish, soak the skinned neck, legs, and tail in      cold water in the refrigerator overnight. Drain the meat      and pat it dry, then roll the pieces in flour and set them      aside while you heat 3/4 cup of shortening in a large      skillet.    </p>    <p>      Add the turtle to the pan when the shortening has melted,      and sprinkle it with salt and pepper. Brown the pieces on      each side for about 10 minutes . . . cover the pan with a      lid . . . and continue cooking until the portions are      tender. (It should take around 45 minutes.)    </p>    <p>      If you're going to finish your fried snapper in the oven,      set the temperature control at 350°F. First brown the      turtle . . . then put it in a roasting pan, cover it, place      it in the oven, and check the "finger-lickin" meal in about      an hour.    </p>    <h3>      TOO MUCH LUCK?    </h3>    <p>      If your turtle hunting brings in more snappers than your      family can consume, remember that a marketplace does exist      for the wild meat.    </p>    <p>      Hucksters used to peddle snappers from wagons, especially      during the 30's. Today, many butcher shops and gourmet meat      companies-and even independent groceries-will      handle them . . . some outlets are actually      <em>looking</em> for suppliers. (Keep in mind that cleaning      the turtle first will probably more than double your profit      . . . and be sure to check into any laws that might control      or prohibit the sale of wild meat <em>before</em> you start      selling.)    </p>    <p>      So get out and forage up a few turtles. Whether you turn      them into a tasty soup. a pan-fried treat, or some easy      profits. I think you'll agree that snappers are a quarry      worth catching!    </p>
