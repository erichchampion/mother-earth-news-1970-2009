                      <h5 id="byline">By KATE CARLETON</h5>    <p>      If you're looking for a pleasant way to pile up money for      that big move to the country, you might try heading for a      university. Seriously. Don't enroll, don't join the staff .      . . just live there. My husband and I are doing exactly      that right now and saving more money than seems possible.      The trick is simple . . . we're head residents in a dorm.    </p>    <p>      Don't shudder. The old lady housemother who locks doors and      plays parent is fast disappearing. At today's up-to-date      schools, head residents are generally young people in their      twenties, either married or single. Some are otherwise      unconnected with the university, some work there, some are      former students back to complete their undergraduate work      and some are graduate students.    </p>    <p>      Jon and I are in our late twenties and our only connection      with the university where we live is our position there as      head residents. During the nine-month school year, our      responsibilities are relatively few and we have plenty of      time to hold down other jobs. The rest of the      time-summer and shorter vacations-we're free to      stay in university housing or to take off . . . as we      choose.    </p>    <p>      We live in a fully furnished modern apartment with an      entrance hall, dining room-living room, kitchenette,      hallway, large bedroom, full bath and plenty of closet      space. Our windows look out on a large tree-shaded yard,      and we have a beautiful view down the back to the river. In      the suburbs, this apartment would probably rent for at      least $110 a month and-in the city-it would      easily go (with the parking space) for $150. Instead of      paying any rent, however, we are BEING PAID $400 a year by      the university to live here. Nor do we pay for any      utilities except our private phone (which is a luxury since      we already have a free college phone in the apartment).      Throughout the school year, we also get food in the dining      commons and once-aweek maid service . . . all free, of      course!    </p>    <p>      Last year-our first-we figured we saved at      least $1500 on rent, $400 on heat and utilities and over      $700 on food. So, by living here on campus for two years,      we'll save an easy $5000 on living expenses . . . and that      $5000 will go directly into our back-to-the-land bank      account <em>over and above what we regularly save from our      salaries.</em>    </p>    <p>      In many other ways, living on campus costs less, too.      Students periodically have their own sales-especially      at the end of the term or school year-where clothes,      records, used books, bikes and furniture can all be bought      cheaply.    </p>    <p>      Film festivals, concerts and lectures are often free or      close to it and-when they do cost more than we want      to pay-we just amble over around intermission time      and still catch the last half free. Last year we took in a      complete series of Ingmar Bergman films-in      chronological order and with a short discussion following      each one-for 25 cents apiece. A whole cinema course,      worth more to us than many lecture courses we've taken, for      almost nothing! Auditing actual lectures can be interesting      and inexpensive also and, right now, we're taking a film      course designed and taught by the students themselves.    </p>    <p>      Other activities? At vacation time, the ride board is      filled with names of people needing rides and riders and      it's easy to travel to almost any part of the country for      practically nothing. We can use the university swimming      pool for free, its sailboats for $1 an afternoon and its      tenting and camping equipment for $2 a night during the      week and $3 on weekends. By joining the camera club, we      have access to cameras and developing equipment      and-by simply showing an interest-we can use      campus craft equipment such as woodworking tools and hand      looms.    </p>    <p>      Virtually all these resources are within walking distance      of our apartment and, since we both walk to work, we use      our car very little. So-not only do we save on rent,      food and utilities-but on entertainment and      transportation, too!    </p>    <p>      The advantages of being a head resident are not merely      economic, however. By living here, we've also discovered a      world of intriguing ideas, new concepts and interesting      conversation. We've learned so <em>much</em> without having      to go through any academic hassles and pressures      and-when we do get the money to make our big move      (probably at the end of this school year)-some of the      ideas and friends that we've found here will be invaluable      to us.    </p>    <p>      OK, but what do we DO as head residents?    </p>    <p>      First, we live in a dorm of 175 upperclassmen (the easiest      type of dorm to handle since it's the freshmen who tend to      have the adjustment problems and need the most guidance)      and we relate to our independent guys almost entirely on an      equal friend-to-friend basis.    </p>    <p>      Second, our head resident "job" lasts only nine months a      year. During the summer (and shorter vacations too!) we're      free to live here on our own or take off, as we choose.    </p>    <p>      Third, during the nine months that the students      <em>are</em> here, we actually "work" very little except at      the beginning of each term. Then, we have to hand out room      keys on the day the students arrive and we meet with the      students on scholarship to decide who will work at what job      and at what hours.    </p>    <p>      Finally, we meet with the house council five or six times a      year to see how things are going and to solve any problems      that come up. Jon has lunch once a week with the dean and      other head residents and-if we're going away for a      weekend-we ask one of the students to stay in our      apartment to take any emergency calls.    </p>    <p>      That's it. Period. No "hours" . . . no "police work" . . .      very little bureaucratic red tape. We both have plenty of      time to carry on our regular full time jobs.    </p>    <p>      How do <em>you</em> go about becoming a head resident? Go      to the college or university where you'd like to live and      talk with the Dean of Students. (A liberal co-ed school or      big university is best. Conservative universities and      all-girls' schools sometimes require their head residents      to take a too-active parent role toward students).    </p>    <p>      The Dean of Students may or may not be responsible for      hiring you, but it's important that you meet him and check      him out. He'll be the administrator you'll be closest to      and, if you don't like him or his philosophy, you don't      want the job.    </p>    <p>      There are really very few requirements for being a head      resident. A college degree is desirable, and it helps      immeasurably if you get along easily .with college      students. Any sort of leadership experience will also be to      your credit . . . work on social action projects, teaching,      even camp counseling. These and an      easy-going-but-responsible manner during the interview are      about all you need to qualify . . . it doesn't much matter      how you look.    </p>    <p>      So for free living, a small extra income and the chance to      save a huge percentage of your regular salary while      planning that Big Move to the country . . . check out a      head residency at your nearest university. Moving back to      Mother Earth by way of the college campus may seem like      nonsense at first . . . but it works. It really works.    </p>
