                    <h5 id="byline">      By BARRY FISHLER/COVER    </h5>    <p>      PHOTOS BY ANDREW SCHNEIDER/COVER    </p>        <p>      Modern man-that's you and me - is power hungry      and, in particular, we just can't seem to get enough      electricity. On the other hand, we now know that generating      all the electrical power we use - especially when we      burn fossil fuels such as coal to do - it is one of      today's prime sources of air pollution . . . and that puts      us between a rock and a hard spot. How are we going to have      power without making the air unbreathable . . . and do we      really <em>need</em> to harness all that energy in the      first place? <strong><br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      Many of the environmental groups make a justifiably strong      case against our steadily-increasing demands for      electricity to run such jimcracks as powered toothbrushes.      Still and all, it will probably be some time before we      collectively limit our consumption of electrical energy to      essentials only . . . which puts us right back in the big      middle of the problem. How are we going to generate all      that electricity without continuing to futz up the air,      land and water?    </p>        <p>      Well, there <em>are</em> ways and some of them have been      around longer than man himself. One which has been largely      ignored in this country, although used fairly extensively      in some other parts of the world, involves the harnessing      of <em>geothermal</em> energy.    </p>    <p>      Geothermal power - sometimes called <em>magma</em>      power - is heat energy taken from the planet itself.      As you may know, the core of the earth is molten rock      - or magma - and only the thin outer crust of      our planet is cool. On the average, for every mile we bore      into the earth, the temperature climbs about 113 degrees      Fahrenheit. In some areas this temperature rise can be as      much as 720° F for each mile we drill and, in the      Imperial Valley of California, a jump in temperature of      3,632°F per mile has been recorded in test wells.    </p>    <p>      Now heat <em>is</em> energy but - to make that energy      readily available for the generation of electricity -      we need one more ingredient: water. Heat plus water equals      steam . . . and, if the ground directly above a hot spot on      the earth's crust happens to be porous and filled with      water, There will be created a natural boiler. And if this      boiler is sealed over by a tight layer of clay, we have      - ready made - a tremendous reserve of useable      power. That doesn't happen often but it happens often      enough and this is exactly the situation that exists in      California's Imperial Valley.    </p>    <p>      Tests there have shown that geothermal wells sunk into the      huge natural boiler under the Valley will tap enough live      steam to drive generators capable of supplying two-thirds      of all California's electrical needs for years and years to      come. Furthermore, the steam brought to the surface from      that gigantic pressure cooker contains only a two to three      percent mineral content and - by desalting the water      which condenses from the steam - approximately 5 to 7      million acre feet of water per year will be added to the      state's supply.    </p>    <p>      Other tests indicate that more water from underground      sources will flow into the natural boiler beneath Imperial      Valley as fast as the steam is piped out . . . so it would      seem that the process will perpetuate itself for many      years. It would also seem that if harnessed - thus      one natural generating station could supply a significant      amount of fresh water and two-thirds of the electricity      needed by all of California for decades.    </p>    <p>      But how do we <em>know</em> it'll work? Well, of course, we      won't know for certain until we try. On the other hand, 17      steam wells were sunk in Mexico eight years ago and they've      been spouting thousands of barrels of hot water and steam      at pressures reaching 1000 lbs. per square inch and      temperatures of 750°F ever since. Some geothermal wells      at Larderello, Italy have been driving electrical      generators since 1904 and New Zealand has harnessed      magma-power for decades.    </p>    <p>      The Soviet Union is currently doing some heavy research in      the field and Japan - which has to import most of its      vitally-needed coal and oil - is expected to tap      natural steam during the next decade for the generation of      a major portion of its electricity.    </p>        <p>      Perhaps the best example, though, of a country making a      real effort to satisfy its power needs with geothermal      energy is little Iceland. True, Iceland <em>does</em> enjoy      some unique advantages that make magma-power more than      usually obvious and accessible to its citizens . . . but      there's no reason to let that stop us from duplicating its      geothermal success whenever possible.    </p>    <p>      By the way, Iceland is <em>not</em> covered with ice. As a      matter of fact - located on one of the earth's      youngest land masses and perched on an extremely thin      section of the planet's crust - the country literally      boils. Huge plains of volcanic dust and boulders cover the      surface of much of the island and steaming geysers and      scalding springs are common landmarks in many areas of its      largely treeless landscape.    </p>    <p>      There is definitely an inverse ratio between the unfavored      countryside of Iceland and the level-headed common sense of      its inhabitants, however, because when the people there      decided to make themselves a little progress they didn't      blindly set out cutting and burning and wastemaking to do      it. Instead, they did the sensible thing (remember when we      used to be that way ourselves?) and looked at the earth      around them. "Hummm," they said, "if the water and steam      churning away beneath us is already boiling hot or hotter .      . . and there's so much of it that it bubbles all over the      landscape . . . why not put it to use'?"    </p>    <p>      So they did.    </p>    <p>      Take Reykjavik, for instance. Half of Iceland's 200,000      people live in or near this capital city and -      through the courtesy of Mother Earth and the District      Heating System - -every last person enjoys all the      hot water he wants. The whole town, you see, is plumbed      right into the earth's core. Turn on any local equivalent      of an "H" faucet and you'll have as much natural hot water      as you want for as long as you want it. (You'll be      recycling rather than using up resources, too. The hot      water of Iceland is rainwater which has been heated as it      seeps into the island's volcanic rocks.)    </p>    <p>      Reykjavik's city heating plant works the same way. Natural      steam and hot water from below the surface is simply run      through the pipes of the town which, in turn, are buried in      the concrete sidewalks. In addition to supplying such      obvious creature comforts as warmth, this set-up makes for      some rather picturesque situations. For instance, if it's      very cold in Reykjavik (not a common occurance, due to      geothermal activity and the proximity of the Gulf Stream),      you can actually see steam rising from the walks.    </p>    <p>      Snow, of course, melts as soon as it hits the pavement.    </p>    <p>      The creative Icelanders haven't stopped with heated foot      paths, either. A plant at Lake Myvatn, near the Arctic      Circle, stands as operating proof that industry doesn't      <em>have</em> to pollute. There, natural steam is used to      evaporate diatomite (which is exported to Europe for use in      filters) from the floor of the lake. The operation has been      so successful some experts predict that, eventually, all of      Iceland's industry will run on a combination of geothermal      and water power.    </p>    <p>      For that matter, one major Icelandic industry has already      largely converted to magma-power. Since the country is      - agriculturally speaking - far from gifted,      the Icelanders have evolved what amounts to indoor truck      farming in huge greenhouses. And those greenhouses, as      might be expected, are mostly heated by natural steam.      Since much of the flowers, fruit and vegetables produced on      these indoor farms is "organic" or naturally grown . . .      that's about as natural as you can get (and at the      sixty-fourth parallel, to boot!)    </p>    <p>      Such greenhouses are the major industry of the city of      Hverigerdi and the Nature Cure Sanatorium - also      located at Hverigerdi - depends heavily on their      year-round supply of naturally-grown produce. Doctors in      all parts of Iceland regularly send patients to this      sanatorium for post-operative care, general physical      rehabilitation and just plain relaxation.    </p>        <p>      A pleasure widely enjoyed all over Iceland is year-round      swimming in naturally heated water and guests at the Nature      Cure Sanatorium luxuriate in a refinement of this      geothermal gift: three pools (warm, hot and hotter) held at      constant temperature by mixing cooler water with the      magma-heated variety. Hot mud baths are also available at      the center.    </p>    <p>      Sanatorium guests sample still another use for geothermal      heat when dough is placed in a can, sealed, put in a net      and lowered into the mouth of an active steam geyser. When      the container is pulled up 24 hours later, they have      steam-baked organic bread'.    </p>    <p>      Such random examples of Iceland's praiseworthy use of her      geothermal resources are all very well, of course, but they      tell only fragments of the whole story. And that story is      so obvious that it's sometimes easy to overlook. I know      that - even after several days in the country -      I still didn't realize just how intelligently and widely      the people of Iceland have substituted clean magma power      for polluting energy sources until I left Hverigerdi's      health center and returned to bustling Reykjavik Suddenly,      I realized that I hadn't started feeling rot ten again upon      my return to "civilization". Thanks to geothermal power,      the air in Iceland's capital is as sweet as that of the      countryside.    </p>    <p>      And that, to me, sums up what Iceland is all about . . . a      people who have built the most meager of natural resources      into a nation of which nature herself must be proud.    </p>    <p>      How tragic it will be if we - who have so much more      than Iceland - disregard this lesson. How tragic if      we insist on plundering Alaska for petroleum, spreading oil      slicks down the western seaboard, stripmining New Mexico      and choking the air of the southwest . . . to run electric      toothbrushes in Los Angeles. How tragic if we refuse to tap      the clean geothermal power in California's Imperial Valley      and wind up . . . in the end . . . with nothing.    </p>
