                <p>      COUNTRY SKILLS    </p>            <p>      Pumping water is a main concern for any home or farm      because, short of gravity feeding, it requires a ridiculous      amount of energy. After surveying our new land, we knew      there were several springs available-a large creek as      well as a river. The houses we had rented previously all      were spring fed so we knew digging a well was an      unnecessary expense and hassle given the bountiful water in      the area. None of the springs, however, were uphill from      either the house or garden spots. We would need a system to      pump from a gathered spring. Some brilliant idea had to      come to our rescue, something that represented a      technological triumph over adverse circumstances. That      brilliant new idea proved to be one that was a few hundred      years old.    </p>    <p>      Build a water ram pump, the next best thing to perpetual      motion.		</p>		<h5 id="byline">By Tom Moates</h5>        <p>      The ram uses the force of water running downhill from a      cistern or dam to pump that water to a site higher that the      original source ... without electricity.    </p>    <p>      The hydraulic ram was a familiar sight in this country      before electrification became widespread. A non electric      water pump with only two moving parts, a waste valve and a      delivery valve, the ram is a prime example of how some      homestead utility problems are solved more appropriately      and reliably by older but well-proven technology than      mainstream electrified alternatives so fully trusted today.      With just those couple of moving parts that rarely wear out      and are both easily replaced if they do, this pump is that      rarest of technological investments, one that both lasts      for generations and is virtually maintenance free. An      additional plus: it can be built by the average person in a      remarkably short time for around $100, depending on costs      for plumbing supplies in your area and what kind of usable      junk you keep around your place.    </p>    <p>      This gadget made its way into my world as our family was      closing on the purchase of our homestead here in the Blue      Ridge Mountains of Virginia. Remaining off grid was our      intention from the start-a choice which carried with      it the need to look at how we would power all aspects of      the homestead right from the beginning.    </p>    <p>      As we began to plan and purchase our solar electric      installation, it became evident that running an electric      pump was financially out of reach. Electric pumps suitable      for our situation were costly, but worse were the costs of      an increased number of panels, a larger inverter, and an      excessive run of electric lines to operate that type of      pump. We had to rule out such a system.    </p>    <p>      Research turned up a few alternative energy books dating      from the seventies with brief articles on ram pumps.      Discussing days past with old-timers at the weekly jamboree      at Cockram's General Store revealed a little more      information on the subject. Mostly, however, the older      crowd focused on the thrilling "CHUCHUNK" that "boomed      through the holler" when a good-sized ram was operating.    </p>    <p>      Although several sources discussed the ram in detail, a      clear explanation by picture, description, or discussion of      how the machine operated was elusive. Perhaps I was just      dense, but until I began building my first ram, the entire      operation of the machine remained a mystery to me.    </p>    <p>      <strong>How the Pump Works</strong>    </p>        <p>      The hydraulic ram uses the force of water running downhill      through a pipe to then pump some of that water uphill to a      site higher than the source. Ex-physics students will no      doubt be wrinkling their noses in hesitation after that      remark, but bear with me. Water enters the system by      running from some source (a spring cistern or dammed creek      for example) into an intake pipe. The water moves downhill      through the pipe some distance, enters the pump, and then      exits the pump (and therefore splashes out onto the ground)      through an open "waste" or "clack" valve. This produces a      moving column of water. By allowing the column of water to      flow downhill freely through the waste valve the kinetic      energy of the moving water is prepared to work the pump.      Eventually the flow of this water increases to a point that      overcomes the tension of the waste valve spring and the      clack (the rubber part of the waste valve) closes. By      abruptly stopping the flow of the column of water,    </p>    <p>      a tremendous pressure is created. This pressure can't very      well back out the inlet pipe, rather it is led through      another pipe, through a one way "check" valve, and into a      compression chamber. The compression chamber is simply a      length of pipe capped at the top which remains partially      full of air. The water whooshes past the check valve with      all its fury squishing the air in the compression chamber      until the kinet is energy is converted to, and rests for an      instant as, potential energy in the form of compressed air.    </p>    <p>      Next the compressed air pushes the water back out of the      compression chamber with all the energy it has stored.      Since the check valve is a one-way valve, the water being      forced backwards cannot return from whence it came;      therefore this water is forced through the exit gate valve      and into the delivery pipe, thus traveling uphill as far as      the energy from the compression chamber will take it. This      water continues to move as the ram cycles with the waste      and check valves opening and closing and eventually reaches      its uphill destination.    </p>    <p>      When water and air are compressed together, some of the air      mixes with the water. Because of this, air must be      reintroduced to the system constantly or else water leaving      the compression chamber will take with it all the air in      the pump, thus ceasing function altogether. To avoid this      problem, a small "snifter" hole must be present below the      check valve so that each cycle brings a gulp of air into      the system which rises into the compression chamber and      keeps the machine from water logging.    </p>        <p><strong> Site Analysis</strong></p>		<p>      First, explore your site to see whether or      not it is suitable for a ram. You can harness almost any      significant flow and fall to run a ram of one size or      another. Problems may arise, however, when you figure the      volume required of a system and the delivery height.    </p>        <p>      The formula for figuring these things is about two feet      long. If a little physics study in the library is more time      than you can devote right now, local engineers will be able      to conduct a site analysis, including computer-generated      plans for a set of numbers from your specific site. They      will ask for the amount of fall from the source to the pump      station, amount of water available from the source, height      to be delivered, and amount of water needed at the delivery      site (among other things) and then they calculate all the      necessary aspects of your pump and system. Their results      tell you in extreme detail the measurements of everything      from drive pipe diameter, waste valve size, angle of drive      pipe to the length of delivery pipe and its      diameter-everything necessary to maximize the      efficiency of your particular installation.    </p>    <p>      For those more inclined to build and tinker without a great      deal of mathematical forethought, the ram shown here will      operate under a substantial range of applications. It is      intended for an input flow of 5 gallons/minute, a driving      drop of 20 feet, and a delivery height of 100 feet. With a      new, highly efficient delivery valve (see source list), it      will provide more than 1,000 gallons/24 hours, but with the      check valve listed that drops to about 250 gallons/24      hours.    </p>    <p>      You may increase the size of the ram by upping the size of      the various pipe fittings which, generally speaking, will      enable the ram to pump more water since more is available      to drive the pump. Any small- sized ram pump can operate      under a fairly wide range of circumstances, but poor      efficiency is always the cost of off-sizing.    </p>    <p>      If plenty of water is available at a site with a nice drop,      then efficiency may not be important. Also, on this model      the tension of the spring and the depth of opening on the      waste valve are adjustable, making adjustable the speed of      the cycling of the pump. This allows efficiency to be      improved by means other than simply pump sizing.    </p>    <p>      One other possibility for system design is to run two rams      in parallel, thereby doubling output. Of course a site      would require adequate water. to drive the pumps in this      configuration.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Building the Pump</strong>    </p>                <p>      Now that the operation has been explained,      building the pump will make more sense. To build this      average-sized ram you will need:    </p>		      <p>The only part of assembly more complicated than screwing      pipe fittings together is constructing the waste (clack)      valve. This waste valve is a modification of a very      dependable design promoted by VITA (Volunteers in Technical      Assistance).    </p>    <p>      The first step to making the valve is to take one of the 2"      x 1" bushings and have a smooth surface machined inside      where the rubber washer/seal will bear against it when in      the closed position (refer to photo). The machinist here in      town does mine for $10, which is probably a reasonable      average to expect most anywhere. While at the shop, for      those who don't have the facilities and experience to cut      and weld metal, have 4" cut off the 40" piece of 1 1/2" x      1/8" strap and have it brazed or welded in place on the top      of the bushing close to, but not covering, the 1" threaded      hole. The galvanizing needs to be ground off the bushing to      allow the brazing or welding to hold properly. Drill two      1/2" holes through the small strap on the bushing that      correspond to two of the same size at one end of the 36" of      strap still remaining, so the two may be bolted together      with a piece of rubber between them. A drill press makes      this process easier, but it can be done with a hand drill.      Next, make a mark 16" from the end with the two 1/2" holes      and bend the strap around a 1 1/2!" pipe, centering the      mark in the bend to make the waste valve spring. Drill two      1/4" holes corresponding to one another at the top and      bottom of the spring, right where it flattens out after the      half-circle bend to allow for one of the 1/4" x 3" bolts to      pass through both holes. Add two nuts, one to adjust the      tension of the spring and the other to act as a lock nut to      keep the adjustment from moving during operation. Two more      holes must be drilled and then the hard part is over. Bolt      the spring in place to the bushing with the two 1/2" bolts      finger tight. Make a mark in the center of the strap      exactly where it passes over the center of the 1" in the      bushing. Make nother mark beyond the first toward the end      of the spring directly over the far edge of the bushing.      Now unbolt the spring from the bushing and drill a 1/4"      hole at the mark towards the end of the spring and a 3/8"      hole at the mark made directly over the bushing's opening.      To complete the waste valve, cut a piece of rubber (I use      tractor tire tube for all the rubber pieces needed in this      ram) large enough to sandwich between the waste valve      spring and the stud it bolts to on the bushing. Cut holes      for the two 1/2" bolts to pass through and then bolt the      spring tightly in place using a lockwasher under each nut.      Take the 3/8" bolt and place on it a 3/8" flatwasher, then      the 1/2" flatwasher, then a piece of rubber cut into a 1      3/8 " outer diameter circle, then the other 3/8"      flatwasher, and finally the length of copper pipe. Pass the      fully loaded bolt through the machined bushing and then      through the 3/8" hole in the spring. On the top side of the      spring, add a lockwasher and a nut and tighten snugly the      whole works.    </p>    <p>      It is imperative that this part of the valve open and close      in perfect alignment so that the rubber washer closes      completely on the machined surface inside the bushing and      that it not bump or rub the side of the bushing in any way      as it opens and closes. Slightly bending the spring or bolt      works to tweak out a valve not perfectly aligned. Finally      add the 1/4" bolt through the final hole left in the spring      to make the opening depth of the waste valve adjustable.      Add a piece of rubber over the head of the bolt by cutting      two holes and pulling it down the bolt and over the head to      reduce shock to the spring and help reduce wear.    </p>    <p>      The waste valve is now complete and needs only to be      screwed into the system. Next, take the street bend and      drill a Clinch1/16-inch hole just below the threads on one      end. Take a small piece of copper or brass wire, bend it      into a cotter pin shape, place it in the hole, and then      spread the pin ends so it stays in the hole but may move      around freely. This both prevents scum buildup and deters      the tiny bit of water that will escape from the snifter      hole from flowing out in a stream. To put the pump      together, find a vice and a pipe wrench. Using the diagram      and photos as a guide, wrap all male threads well in Teflon      tape and screw the pump together a piece at a time. Some      people pour a bit of concrete over the bottom of the ram to      hold it fast while operating. That is not necessary for a      little pump like the one described here. In fact, keeping      the unit portable may be useful on some homesteads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Installation</strong>    </p>    <p>      Be creative with your installation site and use common      sense to guide the construction of your pump's environment.      If the ram is pumping springwater, it should not freeze      under even bitterly cold conditions. If, however, it were      to stop running, then it would certainly freeze and break.      Placing the ram in an in-ground structure or likewise in      some concrete or stone spring house type structure will      prevent freezing under any conditions. Also, bury all      system pipes below the frost line to avoid wintertime      problems.    </p>    <p>      The only other major advice to follow is to make a nice      intake screen at the source. Frogs, leaves, and the like      can stop a ram dead and have you disassembling the whole      mess to figure out the problem.    </p>    <p>      Tinker with the spring tension and clack opening      adjustments to get the right ram speed for your particular      installation. The slower the pump cycles the more water      gets pumped per stroke, but the more water is necessary for      operation. If the ram action stops after a bit then you may      need to speed the pump up a bit by loosening spring      tension.    </p>    <p>      Aside from foreign matter entering the system, little can      halt your ram pump. I know of one configuration that has      been running for six years without fail and I have heard of      many going fifteen years without clack replacement. In the      right situation the ram far outperforms its electrified      cousins and it's an investment of time and money with a      guaranteed return rarely seen in the world today.    </p>    <p>      For information on site analysis, contact New Dawn      Engineering (P.O. Box 440, Floyd, VA 24091, (540)      745-4782).They of fer a model of an ultra-efficient      delivery valve which greatly increases the ram's power.      Moonlight Solar (2932 Vicker Switch Rd., Christiansburg, VA      24073, (540) 3814971) is    </p>    <p>      the only other alternative energy company carrying the      valve in the United States. They also plan to feature a      versatile air compressor attachment for hydraulic rams,      available hopefully by the summer. You may wish to inquire      about the progress of that when you call.    </p>
