                <p>      HOMESTEADING    </p>            <p>      Maintaining a trapline over hundreds of miles of the      shifting ice and bitter winds of the Alaskan bush is just      part of life for the Collins sisters. In their second      report, Miki and Julie describe how necessity really is the      mother of invention as they take a crash course in log      cabin construction.<br />    </p>		<h5 id="byline"><em>By Julie Collins</em></h5>    <p>      Building a cabin in the Alaskan wilderness is easy-at      least compared to getting permission from the government!      My sister Miki and I didn't need a very big      cabin-just 10 by 12 feet for overnight stops on our      80-mile trapline. The trapline, established 80 years ago by      our neighbor Slim Carlson, had nearly two dozen cabins      scattered over several hundred square miles of Alaskan      wilderness, but Slim grew old and so did his cabins. By the      time we inherited the line in the 1970s, most of the tiny      log structures were unusable.    </p>    		<p>      Our dogs deserve a break after getting supplies across      melting ice as spring approaches. Taking the horses home      after their work is done. Opposite: Julie, Arthur, and Miki      in front of the cabin. Below: Supply tent, torn by a      grizzly. Miki, Lilja, and Dropi logging on the ice bridge.    </p>    <p>      Two good cabins were built before the federal government      tightened regulations on people who use the land but don't      own it. So when we opened the old Twelve-Mile, we pitched a      wall tent beside Slims collapsed relic of a cabin. Tent      life in the Alaskan winter is not unpleasant, but caring      for furs is difficult, cutting firewood an endless chore,      and hauling an ungainly canvas tent 30 miles out by dog      team each fall a real problem. So we applied for a permit      to construct a small cabin to replace Slim's. Five years      later, approval seemed imminent. Meanwhile, we made do with      the tent.    </p>    <p>      In late winter 1992, the environmental impact statement,      archeological and biological surveys, and public comment      periods were completed. Our speck of a house in that      isolated corner never visited by outsiders (except the      officials) was virtually approved, but...not...quite.    </p>    <p>      Faced with the dilemma of whether to move freight and      building supplies to the site before spring breakup made      travel impossible, we decided to go ahead. Moving over      4,000 pounds of animal feed and supplies for two months for      the two of us, our 15 sled dogs, and three tough little      Icelandic horses proved time-consuming. By dog team, snow      machine, and packhorse, we moved loads of 250-400 pounds,      taking two or three days per 60-mile round trip. When the      ice on one stream abruptly broke up and departed, we      stockpiled everything there until we hauled a canoe out to      ferry freight across. On the last trip, our loyal huskies      leaped into the frigid black water to swim across before      pulling the sled the last three miles to the cabin site.      The horses, too, clambered down steps in the waist-high      shelf ice clinging to the banks. They waded carefully      across the hip-deep river, then donned their packs again.      We crossed one creek on a tiny ice bridge, but found the      Twelve-Mile creek still frozen as we marched triumphantly      up to the tent camp-only to find the tent in a      shredded ball, gear and groceries scattered far and wide! A      spring grizzly had had his fun here before moving on.    </p>    <p>      Miki made it back to our mainline cabin for replacement      supplies, but with swamps thawing and river ice rotting,      any further travel would be impossible until after snowmelt      and runoff floods subsided. With the exception of an      aircraft radio for contacting the rare overhead airplane,      we had no way to contact the outside world.    </p>    <p>      The extreme isolation might make some people feel trapped,      but we had grown up all over this country, and except for      taking extra care to prevent serious accidents, we settled      in quite comfortably.    </p>    <p>      We had a permit to cut timber, but with the building permit      still stumbling through a maze of bureaucratic thickets we      hoped for the best as we began gathering construction      materials. I used my chain saw to cut white spruce logs,      straight but not too big for two girls and a small horse to      handle. Peeling the logs with a drawknife wouldn't have      been too difficult despite the still half-frozen bark, but      we left that tool at home to save weight. So we used axes      instead, making the work time consuming. Our palomino pinto      mare, Lilja, dutifully dragged in the larger skinned logs,      fearlessly crossing the sagging ice of the shallow      Twelve-Mile creek as gaping holes melted and expanded above      and below the trail. Dropi, the more timid chestnut      gelding, handled the smaller logs.    </p>    <p>      We did our best to respect the government guidelines. Slash      had to be scattered, trees cut flush with the ground, camp      kept tidy, and Slim's historical legacy left undisturbed.      Scattering the branches and bark was no problem, but with      heavy wet snow still covering the ground in early May,      cutting trees flush proved so difficult that I returned      after snowmelt to shave down the stubble of stumps. Slim's      "legacy" included widely scattered tin cans, a stove pipe,      buckets, and drums; so how could the camp ever look tidy if      we were prohibited from picking it up?<br />    </p>            <p>      Miki chinking and splitting roof logs. Miki chinking and,      later, trapping the Twelve-Mile cabin walls.Lilja hauling      moss for the roof.    </p>        <p>      With over 30 logs drying in the lengthening days of May, we      turned to roofing materials. Short logs, peeled and split      with chain saw, wedge, and maul into half-rounds, made      slabs for the roof. (We learned that if the bark peels off      in a spiral, the grain is also twisted, which means using      the saw often to start a new split whenever the crack      spirals off course.) Thick sheets of lush moss, free now of      winter's snow, parted reluctantly from the forest floor to      be piled into a dogsled that Lilja or Dropi dragged out of      the woods.    </p>    <p>      With May well advanced now and the creeks swollen with ugly      brown runoff, we began to scan the skies for the airplane      that was to airdrop our precious permit. Our building      materials all gathered and ready, we killed time by riding      along the creek, seeking out scattered greenery and last      year's dry grass so the horses could stretch their      dwindling supply of pelletal feed. We cut and hauled in      firewood and picked fermented cranberries (last year's      crop) to mix in our sourdough. We tapped birch trees,      collecting up to six gallons a day of the clear thin fluid      for syrup and for drinking water to replace water supplied      by clear ice that was washed away by the unpotable spring      flood. With my chain saw, I milled lumber from spruce logs,      making enough for the new cabin's bed and table.    </p>    <p>      We went on picnics and walked the dogs a few at a time.      Joni and her four grandpups enjoyed playfully chasing      phalaropes as the tiny shorebirds twirled around a little      pond. Old Streak, the most reliable guard dog, dutifully      treed squirrels and a porcupine, which helped stretch the      meat powder and rice we cooked for the dogs. Barki, Peter,      Arthur, and Beau tackled a startled black bear but gave up      the enterprise when I called them off. Toulouse's favorite      game was to follow Andi and swing off the yearling colt's      bushy red tail, while a highlight for Wiggles came when he      pushed into the tent to eat our carefully hoarded Oreo      cookies.    </p>    <p>      On a clear, calm evening in late May our brother Ray flew      overhead, dropping a sack of fresh fruit and meat that      splattered across the sandbar, narrowly missing one of the      horses! Glad to hear on the radio that all was well in the      outside world, we scraped up the hamburger and had another      picnic.    </p>    <p>      Four days later another plane droned overhead. This time      the streamer shooting out the window bore a more precious      cargo: the cabin permit. Moments later we broke the ground,      and by morning a layer of gravel over the bone-dry loose      substrate provided a suitable foundation.    </p>    <p>      Truth is, Miki and I had never built a cabin by ourselves,      although we'd helped other people several times. Undaunted,      we fitted the logs with ax and chain saw, aiming for a      paper-thin fit but settling for any gap smaller than a      little finger. I notched the top instead of the bottom of      the logs: a professional's no-no, but a much faster method.      In this dry location, and with a good roof, moisture was      unlikely to accumulate in the faceup notches, and with our      food dwindling rapidly, time pressed harder than the desire      to do fine work.    </p>    <p>      With logs only 10-14 inches in diameter and 15 feet long or      less, we suffered only a few kinked muscles and never      re-sorted to ropes, planks, or horses to lift the logs up      the ever-growing walls. Due to a limited number of spikes,      we only nailed diagonal corners. In five days we finished      the walls and suddenly had to face the fact the we had no      idea how to erect the gable ends, which had to balance atop      the walls yet be secure enough to support the two purloins      and the ridge pole. Making things up as we went, we spiked      in the logs, slanting the ends for the roof angle. Then we      popped sweat and cracked bones raising the long, heavy      purloin logs and ridge pole. At roughly 18 feet in length,      the ridge pole would provide a protective overhang in the      rear, and a sizable porch in the front for storing      equipment. I drove the chain saw through the front wall,      making two vertical cuts and shoving out the center: a      door. The next day June 6, I left.    </p>    <p>      Because of the many open rivers and swamps that made winter      trails impassable in the summer, the process of moving the      crew back home would be far more complicated than moving      out, so we began even before finishing the cabin. Leaving      Miki to start the roof by fitting and nailing half-rounds      to the ridgepole and wall, I headed home on foot with seven      of our huskies. Toulouse, Joni, Cody, Wiggles, Reuben,      Peter, and Barki ranged ahead as I waded rivers and circled      lakes and bogs, taking two tough days to reach home. I      planted our garden and left the dogs with our parents,      heading back out to find that Miki had chinked the walls      and finished nailing on the slabs: a bigger job than we      thought since a miscalculation gave us only half as many      half-rounds as we actually needed!    </p>    <p>      With very little dog food remaining, Miki set off to bring      five more dogs home: Old Streak, Amber, Bingo, Dusty and      Smokey. During her five-day absence, I threw plastic      sheeting over the slab roof, hammered a moss pole along the      lower edges to keep the sod from sliding off, and packed      many buckets of dirt and gravel to scatter on the Visqueen      before I added a layer of sod and another layer of moss      which resulted in over a foot of excellent      insulation-an improvement over the paper-thin canvas      wall tent!    </p>    <p>      I made quick work of banging together a table beneath the      tiny front window, and a slab bed against the back wall.      When assembling a door from the planks that had been our      bed in the tent, I cut it slightly shorter than the door      frame to allow room for the log walls to settle. A quilt      hung over the door would help protect us from the winter      cold which could dip to -50°F. Finally, the stovepipe      safety: a section of a steel drum with a 5gallon metal      bucket centered in it to secure the stovepipe in the roof.      By the time Miki returned, the cabin was essentially      finished. By using local resources-logs, poles,      gravel, sod, and moss-we limited the materials we had      to haul to spikes, nails, plastic sheeting, stove, and      stovepipe. The stovepipe safety came from discarded items      already in camp. Tools included the chain saw and axes,      shovel, maul, and wedge. A drawknife, peevee, scribe, and      other logging tools would have been helpful, but      all-purpose tools such as the ax made adequate substitutes      in that isolated location. We spent just one night together      under the solid roof-but only after pitching our      mosquito proof pup tent inside!    </p>    <p>      Our great adventure in cabin building over, we immediately      turned our attention to the great adventure of getting the      horses home without drowning them in the endless meandering      swamps that barred the path. A 130-mile detour did the      trick nicely. By staying on dry riverbanks and sandbars, we      trekked away from home to the high country of the Alaska      Range, before crossing to a river whose banks would lead us      back home. With two horses packing and young Andi foraging      loose, we walked the whole way. The three remaining dogs,      Pepper, Arthur, and Beau, ranged loose, wearing packs.      Bear, wolf, porcupine, and moose crossed our path,      diverting the dogs almost daily, although they rarely left      our side for long. Adventures with boggy creeks and      quicksand paled in comparison to the black storm that      swallowed us up one morning. The cloud of mosquitoes that      normally fogged our path vanished as a fine gray ash sifted      down on our small party. Mt. Spurr, a volcano 200 miles      south, had erupted and the winds swept the ash plume over      us. We marched grimly through the choking dust for three      days, emerging only after a long drizzle cleaned the      ash-laden brush.    </p>    <p>      Two weeks after leaving our new little cabin, we reached      home to replace our adventures with the long-delayed summer      chores of gardening, fishing, and berry picking.    </p>    <p>      Five months later, we mushed out the trapline trail,      thrilled to see our fine little cabin hunkered down under      towering spruces. How great not to have the bulky tent! How      wonderful to touch a match to kindling and bask in a      radiating heat moments later as the little shelter warmed.      It might be a simple overnight stop on the weekly trapline      circuit, but coming to the cabin was like coming home.    </p>
