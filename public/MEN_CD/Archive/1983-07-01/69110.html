                    <h5 id="byline">      By Paul and Anne Ehrlich    </h5>    <hr />        <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor <em>of</em> <em>Population      Studies and Professor</em> <em>of</em> <em>Biological      Sciences, Stanford University) and Anne Ehrlich (Senior      Research Associate, Department</em> <em>of</em>      <em>Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas</em> <em>of</em> <em>ecology and overpopulation      (most</em> <em>of us</em> <em>for instance -have read      Paul's book</em> The Population Bomb) <em>. . . few</em>      <em>people have any idea</em> <em>of</em> <em>how deeply      the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research (the type      that tends to be published only in technical journals and      college texts). That's why we're pleased to present this      regular semi-technical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educator s .</em><br />      <br />      In spite of its population problems, the People's Republic      of China (P.R.C.) has proved to be a "super-achiever" in      terms of improving the health of its people. The average      life expectancy of a Chinese at birth is now between 60 and      70 years . . . a decade or more longer than that of people      in other large, poor countries such as India, Indonesia,      Nigeria, and Bangladesh.<br />      <br />      One reason for this improvement is that the Chinese      population is no longer subject to massive famines      (although millions-especially in times of drought-may still      be malnourished). And though the average diet barely meets      the minimum nutritional requirements, the distribution of      food has been enormously improved, <em>so local</em> crop      failures no longer mean starvation.<br />      </p>      <h3>WATER CONTROL</h3>    <p>      In fact, despite a near doubling of the population during      the Communists' rule, the Chinese have increased grain      production to keep pace. This is a considerable achievement      in view of the far-from-ideal agricultural conditions that      prevail in a country which has long suffered from an      alternation of floods and droughts. (The 2,117 years      leading up to 1911 saw 1,621 floods and 1,392 droughts      recorded ... about a disaster-and-a-half per year!)<br />      <br />      The Yellow River, for example, has created constant      problems. It runs through deep beds of <em>loess,</em>      sandy formations left by the wind. From these, it picks up      the heavy silt deposits that give the river its name.      (Indeed, at times the river is almost half silt!) As this      detritus accumulates on the bottom of the river, the bed      gradually rises, which-in the past-often caused the water      to overflow the banks and brought suffering and death to      those who lived on its flood plain.<br />      <br />      In order to contain the river, the Chinese-centuries      ago-enclosed it in a system of dikes. Maintenance of this      system required organization that transcended feudal      domains and led to centralized bureaucracies that go back      more than 2,500 years.<br />      <br />      Even today, though, because the Yellow River watershed has      been largely deforested and thus the services of trees in      absorbing and gradually releasing water have been lost-some      threat of floods persists. In fact, the bed of the Yellow      River is now well <em>above</em> the level of the northern      China land through which it flows.<br />      <br />      To protect the land around the Yellow River <em>and</em>      the nation's many other flood plains against the vagaries      of the Chinese weather, the P.R.C. has launched massive dam      projects and reforestation programs to contain its water      supply. Such efforts, along with what is now the world's      largest irrigation system, probably will help prevent      disastrous flooding in the future.<br />      </p>      <h3>AGRICULTURE:INNOVATIONS AND      PERILS</h3>     <p>      While expanding its ancient irrigation systems, Chinese      agricultural research has in many ways been innovative as      well. Much work has been done on inter-cropping . . .      growing two or more crops together in ways that give higher      yields-and fewer pest problems-than do monoculture      plantings. Biological pest control methods have been      extensively employed, and the use of natural organic      fertilizers has been developed to a fine art. In addition,      agricultural production has been centrally planned to meet      local needs, as opposed to growing cash crops for export.      And the peasants have been involved in these      processes.<br />      <br />      There has, however, been a dark side to Communist China's      agricultural development. As in the United States, urban      expansion has been destroying cropland . . . a loss that,      while clearly serious in America, could be      <em>catastrophic</em> in China. Between 1957 and 1977, the      total number of cultivated acres dropped from 265 million      to 245 million. This reduction occurred in spite of the      fact that considerable portions of wilderness were turned      into farmland during that period . . . the actual amount of      cropland urbanized in those 20 years is estimated to be      about 70 million acres. And farmland continues to be      destroyed faster than new land can be made arable. The      P.R.C. urgently needs to build up and not <em>out,</em> as      is now the case with its sprawling, landwasting,      traditional "courtyard and compound" architecture.<br />      <br />      Then, too, central planning has not always yielded sound      decisions. Mao created an Inner Mongolian dust bowl by      decreeing that the area's arid grassland be planted in      grain. The attempt was an immense agricultural failure . .      . one that caused 10 million acres to become "desertified".      Repair of the land, if it's possible, may take a      century.<br />      <br />      Likewise, in Yunnan (in southwest China along the Burmese      border), a million acres of rare tropical forest were      burned . . . all to make <em>poor</em> cropland. Across the      nation in the northeastern province of Heilongjiang, 5      million acres of marshes were drained to the a new granary.      But that draining has already altered the local climate so      dramatically that much of the area is drying up.<br />      <br />      In short, the race between food and population in China is      still being run. The P.R.C. now has a mere <em>quarter of      an acre</em> of arable land per person. Confronted by an      array of both favorable and inauspicious signs, scientists      can not yet conclude with any confidence whether the      problems of feeding the Chinese masses have been      solved.<br />      </p>      <h3>OTHER RESOURCES</h3>      <p>      In nonfood resources, China is relatively rich. It has a      good supply of offshore oil and large coal deposits. The      latter, unfortunately, are still used quite inefficiently.      It takes, for instance, roughly three times as much coal to      make a ton of steel in China as it does in Japan.<br />      <br />      Coal is also the primary source of one of China's most      obvious environmental problems . . . air pollution. Besides      its use in industry, coal is the main fuel employed for      cooking, home heating, and boiling China's almost      universally polluted water. In fact, even though cigarette      smoking among Chinese men is epidemic, rural <em>women</em>      have more lung cancer than their male counterparts . .      presumably because of the women's higher exposure to coal      smoke in the home.<br />      <br />      Acid rain is another result of China's wide use of coal.      Its full extent is not known, but what a known is pretty      grim. In 1981, in one city in the western province of      Qinghai, Dr. John Harte of the University of California      measured precipitation that had a pH of 2.24 . . . which is      roughly the acidity of lemon juice.<br />      <br />      What's more, nothing has yet been done about surface-level      water pollution. Some 90% of industrial liquid waste goes      directly into rivers and streams. (While consuming drinking      water on our recent trip to China, we wondered how much of      it might contain heavy metals and other pollutants that      were <em>not</em> removed by the ubiquitous boiling.)<br />      <br />      Historically, of course, the origins of China's      <em>main</em> eco-catastrophe far outdate the current      regime. As George Borgstrom wrote in 1969, "Already in the      famous era of the bronze vases, when the water buffalo was      domesticated, China in effect committed its great      ecological blunder of cutting down the forest to gain      agricultural land."<br />      <br />      A massive attempt is being made to correct this mistake.      China plans to reforest over a million square miles . . .      an area four-fifths the size of India. The Chinese now talk      of a greenbelt 4,350 miles long running parallel to the      Great Wall. This "Green Wall" would be a barrier against      desertification. In 1980, it was reported that 3,500 square      miles of the Green Wall had already been planted.<br />      <br />      Still, China has made just a bare start in implementing      such grandiose plans. In our<br />      <br />      1982 travels, we were both impressed and depressed in this      regard. First, every one of the numerous wooded areas we      saw in the eastern part of the country consisted of even      aged stands of trees . . . clearly the result of a      tremendous effort at reforestation. But second, we were      struck by the tiny proportion of the vast, denuded areas      that has been replanted. The mountains around the Great      Wall north of Beijing, for example, display only scattered      patches of replanted trees.<br />      <br />      Much can still go wrong in areas that <em>are</em>      reforested. Transplanted seedlings do not necessarily      survive, and the exotic tree species (such as eucalyptus)      that are sometimes used may be difficult to maintain on a      long-term basis.<br />      <br />      Deforestation is just <em>one</em> symptom of China's      biotic impoverishment. In the far west around the Amne      Machin mountains, an area once rich in wild mammals has      been so ravaged by overgrazing that soon it won't even      support <em>domestic</em> animals. There also remains a      rich bounty on the heads of the few remaining snow leopards      . . . and the local tribesmen don't have to share such      bounty with their communes (as they must, say, any fees      earned from guiding services).<br />      <br />      On the other hand, the Chinese <em>do</em> display a      growing ecological consciousness-concern over the      preservation of the giant panda is one example of this-and,      of course, a widespread and deeply rooted traditional love      of birds, flowers, and natural beauty.<br />      </p>      <h3>POLITICAL FACTORS</h3>    <p>      Any overall evaluation of the environmental future of the      P.R.C. must include consideration of the political problems      that plague China's ancient society. Large portions of the      population are said to have been permanently alienated from      the Communist Party by the brutal excesses of the Cultural      Revolution. Too many of these people were transported from      the cities to virtual slavery in rural areas. Too many had      their careers ruined. Too many saw their loved ones      tortured and killed, and their books and other property      burned.<br />      <br />      As a result of this-and of continual revision of "correct"      policies and positions by the Party-discontent is      widespread. Indeed, the level of criticism the ruling elite      has suffered has forced it to back away from its recent      attempts at democratization.<br />      <br />      No one thinks that another revolution is in the cards, but      it's not at all clear whether the government will receive      the wholehearted support of the population in its future      endeavors that it had in the first decade of its reign. Yet      sound, and fully supported, environmental policy may prove      crucial to the nation's future. In many ways, then, the      People's Republic of China remains a society poised on the      brink of eco-catastrophe. It seems likely that only the      full cooperation of its billion-plus citizens c an keep it      from going over the edge.<br />      <br />      <em>The information on acid rains and Amne Mach is from      John Harte.
