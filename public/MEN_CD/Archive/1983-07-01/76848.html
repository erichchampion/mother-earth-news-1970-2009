                    <hr />    <p>      <strong>JULY MARKS THE MONTH WHEN THE "U.S. COMMITTEE FOR      ENERGY AWARENESS"</strong> a public relations group      representing (and substantially made up of executives from)      utility companies, plans to launch its multimillion-dollar      pro-nuclear ad campaign nationwide. AS we reported in this      column in MOTHER N0. 81, consumers will likely pay most of      the $40-million-plus tab for the promotion, which is      designed to "set the record straight" (according to the      slick TV spots) and convince us all that nuclear power is      both safe and desirable. If the ads appear on local      stations in your area, you're urged to contact the Safe      Energy Communication Council (Dept. TMEN, 1609 Connecticut      Avenue N.W., Suite 4B, Washington, D.C. 20009) for      literature explaining the other side of the story. The      council will also provide, if you wish, information on how      to organize to obtain free broadcast time under the      Fairness Doctrine for communicating the energy alternative      (via your own or SECC prepared messages) over your city's      airwave.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MEANWHILE, AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE KIND OF ADVERTISING      YOU CAN EXPECT FROM THE "U.S. COMMITTEE FOR ENERGY      AWARENESS"</strong> , here's just one audio script from a      CEA television spot. During the commercial, Dr. Leonard      Sagan, M.D., of the Electric Power Research Institute, is      the on-camera spokesperson (an animated sequence of a      cylinder being wrapped and buried is also shown). Says      Sagan, "In laboratories like these, scientists develop      procedures to safely dispose of radioactive nuclear wastes      vital to our continued use of nuclear medicine, nuclear      energy, the defense of our nation. The method is to      permanently seal off the waste from our environment and      store it deep in stable geological formations. The concept      is endorsed by the prestigious National Academy of      Scientists. Most people aren't aware of that. That's why we      brought you this message, to set the record straight."BUT      NO PROVEN MEANS OF SAFE DISPOSAL HAS EVER BEEN      DEMONSTRATED! As James J. McKenzie, Ph.D., senior staff      scientist for the Union of Concerned Scientists puts it,      "Through the use of poorly written, ambiguous language,      this ad would lead the listener to assume that the waste      problem has in fact been solved. To state that 'the method'      is to seal wastes away is to do little more than articulate      a goal that is presently far from being achieved."<br />      <br />      <strong>WHAT'S MORE, RECENT REPORTS FROM THE U.S.      GEOLOGICAL SURVEY</strong> concluded that "the difficulties      and uncertainties connected with the geological disposal of      high-level waste" represent "significant potential      stumbling blocks that need critical attention." And a      year-long study conducted during the Carter Administration      says that the problem is one "whose resolution will clearly      require an unprecedented extension of capabilities in rock      mechanics, geochemistry, hydrogeology, and long-term      predictions of seismicity, volcanism, and climate. "<br />      <br />      <strong>UTILITIES NOW HAVE 10,000 METRIC TONS OF SPENT FUEL      RODS</strong> in "temporary storage", according to Business      Week magazine . . . and each of the nation's 70 nuclear      power plants generates approximately 25 additional tons of      the radioactive garbage every year. Although the Nuclear      Waste Policy Act (passed late last year) mandates the      construction of two "permanent disposal" sites by the year      1998, major obstacles-including the selection of the sites,      the technological problems mentioned above, and the issue      of precisely who will ultimately pay the $14.8 billion      estimated cost of the project (the utilities would like to      pass the price on to customers)threaten to cause      substantial delays.<br />      <br />      <strong>PHOTOVOLTAIC CELLS COULD BE PRODUCING UP TO 30% OF      THE WORLD'S ELECTRICITY</strong> by the year 2050,      according to a report from the Worldwatch Institute (Dept.      TMEN, 1776 Massachusetts Avenue N.W., Washington, D.C.      20036). The organization predicts that-by the 1990's-global      production of solar cells will have increased fiftyfold,      resulting in a multibillion-dollar industry (as compared      with an estimated $150 million in sales worldwide in 1982).      And who, exactly, will get the lion's share of the      business? "Unless U.S. government programs are stepped up      soon or private industry dramatically boosts its      investments," says WI, "Japan will probably surpass the      U.S. in solar cell sales by the end of the decade." The      64-page report-" Worldwatch Paper No. 52"-is available from      the institute for $2.00 postpaid.<br />      <br />      <strong>PUTTING UNTAPPED ENERGY TO WORK-AND SAVING ENERGY,      T00</strong> -is the thrust of an ingenious weatherization      program now being proposed in Kansas City, Missouri. Under      the plan, unemployed sheet metal and carpentry union      members would be put to work (at half the union scale)      retrofitting low-income residences to make them more      energy-efficient. Some 50,000 homes in a three-county area      could qualify for the program . . . and because commercial      donors of building materials and of outright cash      contributions could write off half their gift against      taxes, the "everybody wins" scheme is expected to cost the      city little or nothing!<br />      <br />      <strong>A 300-KILOWATT PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER PLANT BILLED AS      "EUROPE'S LARGEST"</strong> will be completed this summer      on the island of Pellworm in the North Sea .... Not to be      outdone, <strong>A ONE-MEGAWATT PHOTOVOLTAIC POWER      PLANT</strong> in San Bernardino County, California has      earned the title of " <strong>world's</strong> largest" and      is producing enough current to supply 400 homes ....      Electricity prices increased last year at <strong>A RATE      NEARLY 2.5 TIMES THAT OF INFLATION,</strong> amounting to a      total jump of $7.6 billion.... The U.S. Department of      Transportation has recommended the construction of      <strong>A 250-MPH MAGNETICALLY LEVITATED TRAIN SYSTEM      BETWEEN LOS ANGELES AND LAS VEGAS,</strong> and estimates      that the mass transit system could carry as many as 3.2      million passengers . . . and save 20 million gallons of      gasoline every year!    </p>    <hr />
