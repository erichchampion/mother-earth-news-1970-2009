                    <hr />    <p>      <em>A sound design, combined with a simple and commonsense      approach, is the key to developing a successful      structure.</em><br />      <br />      In the past, MOTHER has featured a number of solar houses      built to combine function with economy and aesthetics. This      time around, we're going to break with tradition and      profile an efficient <em>design</em> rather than a finished      dwelling . . . in the hope that this "paper image" will      stimulate as much interest in alternative architecture as      would any <em>completed</em> structure.    </p>            <p>      It all started when solar designer Charles G. Woods-with      his associate, architect Albert Sincavage-approached      MOTHER's editors with the idea of offering our readers an      original plan for a sophisticated but sensibly designed      residence. We gave Woods a green light for his proposal,      but with two stipulations: The home had to be small to      acknowledge the current trend toward downsized housing . .      . and it should, through the judicious use of inexpensive      building materials, have a dollar-per-square-foot figure      near-or preferably lower than-the national norm. We also      suggested that it would be nice if the dwelling      incorporated some innovative (yet practical) features, and      could be owner-built without a lot of difficulty.    </p>        <p>      What Charles came up with was a functional meld of proven      energy-conserving construction techniques all wrapped up in      an attractive and-best of all-highly <em>flexible</em>      design package. "I understood the desire for a compact      arrangement," Woods stated, "and I knew that, since MOTHER      people are doers, they'd be concerned with keeping building      methods simple and costs down. However, I was also aware      that not all families have similar needs . . . and felt it      would be insensitive to limit those excited about the      home's features to a fixed floor plan that they might not      be able to live with."<br />      <br />      So, to make the package attractive to everyone, the      award-winning Pennsylvania designer-who apprenticed under a      direct student of Frank Lloyd Wright-set up the building      using a series of 4"-wide modular units. In other words,      the single-level, 2,460-square-foot house illustrated on      these pages is a bit deceiving, because it's actually an      <em>expanded version</em> of a central "core structure"      that takes up only 1,350 square feet. An individual home      can be easily broadened or condensed from the basic nucleus      (indicated in red on the floor plan). It could even be      <em>shortened</em> from front to back!<br />      <br />      A look at the renderings reveals that Woods relied on two      tried and true techniques to conserve energy: passive solar      insolation and earth berming. But what may not be so      obvious is that he incorporated a number of other features      in the design to further that end. Its 12" all-weather      outside walls are made from bentonite- or butyl-sheathed      <em>wood,</em> and are a lot easier for an owner-builder to      construct than conventional concrete ones . . . though      poured or block walls can be used if desired. (The framing      is also thick enough to accept super levels of insulation.)      The home's two optional fireplaces can provide supplemental      heat if necessary. And while the 1-1/2"-deep plywood roof      joists aren't stout enough to support an earth load (such a      "top" would have added <em>considerable</em> expense), the      roof's supports do allow room for 18" of fiberglass batting      . . . and carry fascia planters for the seasonal vines that      protect the transoms and clerestories from the summer sun's      rays. (Cool tubes can also be used to assist in      warm-weather ventilation.)<br />      <br />      Furthermore, the designer opted to Combine rock storage      with what he describes as a sort of "envelope in function".      He explains, "Collected heat that rises is ducted with the      help of a small fan-to a 4"-deep insulated plenum filled      with stone mass, lying beneath the floor. When needed, this      thermal storehouse supplies the living area with warmth      through a simple forced-air system."<br />      <br />      Woods's detailed calculations show that, in an environment      with 6,300 heating degree days, the house should require      almost no supplemental warmth. In fact, if a builder added      an air-to-air heat exchanger and insulating drapes, backup      heaters would be needed only in the most <em>extreme</em>      cold weather. Fortunately, the cost for all of this is      reasonable. The estimates range from about $25 per square      foot for the shell to somewhere in the neighborhood of $45      per square foot for the completed home. And, of course, the      more contracting you do yourself, the more you can reduce      <em>these</em> figures!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITORS NOTE: A complete six page set of high-quality      working drawings for this house including a perspective,      floor and foundation plans, structural sections,      elevations, mechanical system details, general      specifications and notes, and a materials list-is available      from Charles G. Woods and Associates, Natural Architecture,      Dept. TMEN, RD 3, Box 538, Honesdale, Pennsylvania 18431.      The cost of one set is $115 postpaid, with each additional      set priced at $15 if ordered at the time of purchase. (Plan      purchasers are also entitled to two hours of telephone      consultation with Woods-at 717/253-5452-if they initiate      the call.)</em><br />      <br />      <em>And 35 earlier Woods designs (not including this one)      are depicted in his book,</em> Natural Architecture . . .      available <em>for $15 postpaid from</em> Earth Shelter      Living <em>magazine, Attention: Bill Baker, Dept.
