                    <h5 id="byline">      By Allan R. Talbot    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      It's pretty obvious to anyone who watches television or      reads newspapers that we live in a quarrelsome society . .      . a culture that seems intent upon adding an eleventh      commandment, "Thou shalt sue thy neighbor, whenever      possible", to its liturgy. Still, in many instances,      particularly when environmental issues are contested, there      simply haven't been any alternatives to the use of the      court system. Unfortunately, asking judges to settle      environmental conflicts all too often seems to lead to      crowded court calendars, pyramiding attorney fees, and      results that fail to resolve-or even address the real      problems involved.    </p>    <p>      In recent years, however, mediation which has long been      accepted as a means of resolving labor/management      disputes-has begun to be used in environmental      confrontations . . . and has shown some promising results.      As you likely know, the settlement technique involves      allowing a neutral third party to meet with the opposing      sides, separately <em>and</em> jointly, in order to help      each to understand the other's objectives . . to point out      areas of agreement . . . and to encourage the opponents to      resolve their differences by means of compromise and      negotiation.<br />    </p>          <h3>SUCCESS STORIES</h3>      <p>      One of the most dramatic demonstrations of the potential of      environmental mediation took place in December of 1980,      when rep resentatives of three private utilities, several      public agencies, and two environmental groups were able to      settle their long-lasting dispute over the use of New      York's Hudson River for power production. At the heart of      the controversy was the Consolidated Edison Company of New      York's plan to construct an immense hydroelectric plant on      Storm King Mountain, in the Hudson highlands.<br />      <br />      This particular case could serve as a textbook example of      the limitations and frustrations that can result from      seeking a court remedy. Consolidated Edison had been      attempting to license the plant since 1962, with constant      opposition from activist groups who objected first on      aesthetic grounds (the proposed plant would mar the area's      scenic beauty) . . . and later because of concern that the      installation might harm aquatic life; pollute the adjacent      water table, and perhaps even trigger earthquakes!<br />      <br />      Over the years, the citizens against the plant waged a      broad legal attack. In the course of the struggle, judges      and other officials were called upon to rule on a      continuing series of questions, such as whether or not the      review and licensing agencies had followed the law . . .      examined the available evidence ... <em>and</em> built up      adequate information to support their decisions favoring      construction of the plant. These proceedings resulted in a      total of some $6 million in legal fees, yet never yielded a      final decision as to whether or not the generating facility      should be built!<br />      <br />      The frustration and apparent futility of the nearly      20-year-old struggle finally encouraged both sides to      try-in 1979-to negotiate a settlement. The mediator chosen      was Russell Train, president of the World Wildlife Fund.      Train spent approximately a year and a half meeting with      the opposing patties, in full session and in small      committees, and was finally able to hammer out an      agreement.<br />      <br />      The central point of conflict had through the years-become      the question of the cumulative effect of <em>all</em>      recently built (or proposed) Hudson River power plants on      the aquatic life found in the waterway. The compromise      solution, then, included Consolidated Edison's commitment      to abandon the Storm King project . . . and an agreement on      the part of the environmental groups involved to drop their      demands that utilities construct cooling towers at      <em>other</em> plant sites. (Those additions would have      cost the power companies approximately $500 million to      build . . . and $180 million, annually, to operate.) The      utilities also agreed to finance a research program to      measure the long-term effects of power production on the      river's ecology.<br />      <br />      While the opposing groups involved in the Hudson River case      were able to <em>see</em> that their legal war was likely      endless, and to decide, themselves, to seek a negotiated      solution, mediation is far more typically prompted (or      ordered) by an outsider . . . usually a government agency      or official. For example, in July 1975 Washington's      Governor Dan Evans induced that state's legislature to pass      a bill requiring the councils of Seattle, Mercer Island,      Bellevue County, and King County to vote on a proposed      extension of Interstate 90, one that-if built would pass      through all four districts. Yet, while people in and around      Seattle had been arguing for and against the planned road      since it was first proposed back in 1964, the bill gave the      localities only six <em>months</em> to make up their minds.      In short, Governor Evans' ultimatum set the stage for a      compromise solution.<br />      <br />      Two mediators were assigned to the case, and the pair      proceeded to spend their first three months simply      <em>preparing</em> themselves and the participants for the      bargaining process. This involved (among other things)      convincing everyone in question that the negotiators      were-in fact-impartial, and determining the real objectives      of the opposing groups . . . all in order to see if a      settlement <em>might</em> be possible. Once that groundwork      was completed, the mediators worked with representatives of      each jurisdiction to come up with a route proposal that      would satisfy every region's basic goals. The state highway      department then helped incorporate those ideas into a final      plan. The concluded agreement has since withstood one legal      challenge, and the road is now under construction.<br />      <br />      Another instance where some sort of deadline served as the      catalyst to mediation occurred in Port Townsend,      Washington. Numerous factions of local citizens there were      involved in a seemingly inconclusive argument about the      best location for a much-needed new ferry terminal.      However, when the townsfolk learned that-unless they      reached an agreement soon-the state would give the      necessary construction money to another project entirely,      they decided to seek mediation. Within two and a half      months, the differing parties reached a compromise.<br />      <br />      At its best, mediation can even defuse potentially      <em>dangerous</em> situations. Take, for example, the story      of a particularly bitter dispute between a small-scale      hydropower developer and a lakefront town in Maine. It      seems the individual wanted to draw upon water levels in      the lake for the purpose of power production, but the town      had denied him permission. The conflict drew national      attention when, in January of 1979, an unidentified vandal      set off a firebomb at the wooden gates of the developer's      dam. That violent incident persuaded the governor to ask a      mediator to step in . . . just as the town was planning to      challenge the individual's operating license in a hearing      before the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. The town's      lawyer, knowing that a protracted legal action could put a      serious strain on the municipal budget, was able (with the      encouragement of the FERC) to convince his clients to try      mediation first. Over a three month period, the negotiator      who tackled the case helped both sides agree upon exactly      when, and how much, the developer could draw upon the lake      for his hydropower system. These terms were then written      into the operating license that was provided him by the      town.<br />      <br />      A particularly "touchy" dispute pitted the What com County      Park Board against the Washington state Lummi Indian tribe.      The issue in this case concerned the future use of Portage      Island . . . which the Lummi had sold to the board in 1965,      and which Whatcom County planned to transform into a public      park. In 1970, however, members of the tribe began      patrolling the island -which is located in Bellingham Bay      with <em>in</em> the Lummi reservation in order to prevent      non-Indians from using the site. The Park Board protested,      appealed to the Department of the Interior, and was ready      to take its case before federal court. Beginning in the      fall of 1978, however, a pair of mediators was able to      unravel the problem: The park board agreed to sell the      island <em>back</em> to the Lummi . . . with the      understanding that the tribe itself would then maintain the      site as a public park!<br />      </p>      <h3>LOOKING AT THE LIMITATIONS</h3>      <p>      Although mediation has resulted in the resolution of a      goodly number of environmental battles, it is by no means a      panacea. In fact, an experienced negotiator named Howard      Bellman estimates that as few as 10% of all environmental      conflicts actually lend themselves to mediation. Bellman      feels (and he's not alone) that the technique becomes      useful only when a dispute matures to the point where the      issues at question are clearly defined . . and when the      parties acknowledge that they're facing a standoff They      recognize each other's power and realize that no solution      will be possible without some negotiation. This "perfect      conflict", of course, is quite common with clear-cut      labor/management disputes, but the structure of      environmental controversies is generally a good bit more      complex. There are typically more than two parties and      opinions involved, for example, and the issues are often      not based so much upon dollars and  cents as upon      conflicting notions about how basic decisions affecting the      use of natural resources should be made!<br />      <br />      And unfortunately, some such disputes simply cannot      <em>ever be</em> mediated. The establishment of a nuclear      power plant or offshore drilling rig, for example, will      likely be opposed by groups that are fighting on      <em>ideological</em> grounds and have no interest in      compromise.<br />      <br />      FUTURE TALK<br />      <br />      Environmental mediation-which is still in its infancy-has      thus far been treated as an experimental technique and has      survived through the support of such groups as the Ford,      Rockefeller, Atlantic Richfield, Hewlett, and Mellon      foundations. Funds from these sources are being withdrawn,      however, now that the "experiment" has been completed . . .      so it's time for mediation to become self-supporting.<br />      <br />      Fortunately, the problem-solving method isn't terribly      expensive. The actual mediation costs for the cases I've      described ranged from $3,000 to about $30,000 (either of      which would seem like a bargain compared with the expense      of lengthy litigation). Whether, in the future, negotiators      will charge clients for their services or rely on      governmental support-or both-remains to be seen.<br />      <br />      What is clear, though, is that, under the right      circumstances and conditions, the process works.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Allan R. Talbot's <em>book on</em>      this topic-Settling Things: Six Case Studies in      Environmental Mediation <em>-is available for $8.50 plus      $2.00 shipping and handling from the Conservation      Foundation, Dept.

CLOCKWISE FROM RIGHT. Consolidated Edison wanted to build a giant Hudson River hydropower plant in the side of Storm King Mountain (left bank) that would use water pumped up into a massive highland reservoir. Environmentalists opposed the facility on aesthetic and ecological grounds .... The ferry terminal at Port Townsend, Washington needed to be replaced by a larger landing facility, but local citizens strongly disagreed about where to locate one .... Portage Island, which lay with the boundaries of the Lummi Indian reservation, was supposed to be a public park. Indians who didn't like that idea tried to block access by any outsiders .... The four-lane bridge secured by floating pontoons-on Seattle's old Interstate 90 was too small to handle the booming area's traffic. However, people had been arguing about where to run a new extension since 1964!
