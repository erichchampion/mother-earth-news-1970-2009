        <p>RCA's photovoltaic research has opened a whole new world ofenergy:</p><p>Despite what shortsighted critics say, solar power is the waveof the future . . . and-of course-it's been the basis of ourenergy supply all along, since most of our current power sourceswould not be available today if it weren't for of Sol.Unfortunately, the process of converting sunlight directly intoelectricity which is the form of energy most useful to us bymeans of solar cells has been prohibitively expensive . . . untilnow!</p><p>That's right . . . just recently, a genuine <em>breakthroughin</em> photovoltaic technology-pioneered by a research arm ofthe Radio Corporation of America-has made it possible to reducethe cost of sun-produced electricity from an average of $10 awatt to $1.00 (or less) for that same watt . . . which,unbelievably enough, is even less expensive than someutility-supplied power!</p><p><strong>AGE-OLD TECHNOLOGY</strong></p><p>The truth is, photoelectricity has been around for some time.It was first recognized in 1839, and was eventually developedinto a useful source of energy with the advent of wafer-typesolar cells in the mid-1950's. In a nutshell, a conventionalphotovoltaic cell works like this: A semiconductor material (inthis case, silicon, which is a component of sand and is thusplentiful) is first refined to a high degree of purity in anelectric furnace. Next, this 99%pure material is "cleansed" evenfurther through various chemical processes, and is thenconverted-under intense heat-from a granular form into asingle-crystal state.</p><p>During the conversion process, the silicon is "doped" witheither boron or phosphorus to form P (positive) or N (negative)ingots. The impregnated crystals are then sliced very thin andjoined, P to N, using a doping agent and more heat. With thatdone, minute nickel or aluminum strips are attached . . . toconduct current and act as terminals. When sunlight penetratesthe thin P-layer, a reaction takes place in the "barrier"between. the P and N layers and electricity is produced.</p><p>Obviously, then, the cost of manufacturing a wafer-type solarcell can be quite high. Besides the expense of merely<em>producing the</em> necessary ultra pure silicon, thesubstance must be further processed by physically slicing theingots . . . then each cell must be assembled, which alsoincreases cost. So, not only are the necessary materials at apremium, but the manufacturing steps themselves run into bigdollars.</p><p><strong>THE SECRET'S IN THE SAUCE</strong></p><p>How, then, has RCA broken through the price barrier? To put itsimply, the firm has attacked the problem from a whole newdirection. <em>Conventional pho</em> toelectric cells arerelatively effective in terms of light-to-power conversion,achieving an impressive 10% (or higher) efficiency in the field.However, to achieve such a high rate of efficiency, the cellsmust be manufactured from only the purest grade silicon . . .anything less simply wouldn't yield the magic number.</p><p>RCA researchers decided to try a different approach: Ifmanufacturing costs could be reduced drastically, they reasoned;cell efficiency would no longer be of prime importance. So, asearly as 1974, RCA technicians began developing what they callhydrogenated amorphous silicon cells . . . hardware that not onlyuses inexpensive "impure" silicon, but requires less costlymanufacturing techniques as well.</p><p>According to Dr. David Carlson, group leader of RCA'sphotovoltaic research team, the fabrication process is completelydifferent from that used for conventional single-crystal siliconsolar cells. "We start with a gas called silane, which consistsof silicon atoms surrounded by four hydrogen atoms, and we use anelectrical pre-charge-much like that in a fluorescent tube tobreak up the silane molecules and deposit a film containingbetween 5 and 50 percent hydrogen by atomic weight. In otherwords, the hydrogen is chemically bonded into the silicon . . .and it's the hydrogen that makes the cells work. Prior to ourdiscovery, it was generally accepted -among scientists inphotovoltaic research-that you couldn't use amorphous, ornoncrystal, silicon semiconductors to make solar cells becausethere were too many broken bonds in the 'impure' structures. Butit turns out that the hydrogen 'heals' such defects and makes thematerial a fairly good semiconductor."</p><p>Of course, less costly silicon is only part of the story . . .the fact that the new process minimizes production costs is justas important. Since the gas and precharge technique doesn'trequire intense heat (necessary temperatures have been reducedfrom over 1,400°C to 200°C), not only is less energyconsumed in production, but many types of inexpensive material(including glass, sheet metal, and even plastic) can now be usedas a base or substrate . . . where only a high grade of metal wasacceptable before.</p><p>In addition, the innovative method cuts corners by<em>combining</em> processing steps. The substrate section isfirst coated with a very thin steel or titanium conductive layer,then alternate P- and N-doped layers-sandwiched around a "spread"of undoped silane about half a micron thick -are deposited. (Thebeauty of working with a gas, by the way, is that differentlayers can be "painted" on . . . and the "dope"-in this casephosphine and diborane gas-can easily be premixed with thesilane.) The final step involves coating the structure with atransparent conductive oxide-Indian tin-which naturally carrieselectricity <em>and</em> allows light to pass through. The entireprocess is so relatively quick and easy (it may take anywherefrom 1 to 20 minutes) that it makes the production of"old-fashioned" single-crystal silicon cells almost impractical .. . and, even more important, cuts costs to the point where theglass substrate is the most expensive material used.</p><p><strong>EFFICIENCY IS THE KEY</strong></p><p>Before the company goes into full swing with the amorphoussilicon solar cell program, its people would like to increase theefficiency of the little converters. So far, researchers havemanaged to reach a conversion factor of nearly 5% . . . whichwould put the cells in the range of $1.00 per peak watt for largequantities-right now. Carlson hopes, however, to be able toincrease that percentage in the near future . . . since thematerial they are working with now is <em>capable</em> of aboutan 8% efficiency. (He also claims that-in the next few years-a10% efficiency will likely be achieved.)</p><p><strong>TODAY RCA . . .T</strong> <strong>OMORROW THEWORLD</strong></p><p>Naturally, the effect that the mass production of inexpensivephotovoltaic cells could have on society as a whole is nothingshort of mindboggling. Since such devices will be well within thefinancial reach of the average American family, it isn'tinconceivable that-in the near future-rooftops all across thenation will be covered with arrays of the 3" X 3" minaturegenerating stations. The energy provided by photovoltaic cellscan, of course, be utilized in several ways . . . either totallyindependent of the local utility by adding battery storage(perhaps in combination with electrically heated water storagefor space heating if desired), or on a limited scale-in concertwith the power company . . . by swapping that utility's energy atnight for solar electricity during the day.</p><p>But that's not all . . . since the cells are capable offunctioning even under adverse conditions (RCA researchers findtheir creations can produce between 20 and 30% of total power onan overcast day), future possibilities include using them as asource of power for electric propulsion vehicles (in conjunctionwith lightweight batteries for nighttime use).</p><p>What it all boils down to is that tomorrow's dream is heretoday . . . and it shouldn't be long-perhaps two years orless-before we all can enjoy low-cost, <em>independently</em>produced electricity!</p><p>EDITOR'S NOTE: New developments in photovoltaic researchwithin the past few months may make it possible for us all toenjoy energy independence in the very near future: Keep a weathereye posted toward MOTHER's pages, because in. the next few issueswe should be reporting on. several other pioneering groups whoare on, the verge of making similar momentous discoveries.</p>
