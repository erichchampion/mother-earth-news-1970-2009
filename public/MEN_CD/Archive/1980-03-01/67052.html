                <p>      Here's more garden-tested suggestions from Brent Elswick...    </p>        <p>      Red, juicy, and burstin' with flavor, the tomato is-without      a doubt-one of North America's favorite crops . . . both      for in-thegarden reliability <em>and</em> on-the-table      taste. However, the crowd-pleaser is available in so      <em>many</em> forms that just choosing a prospective      cropper can be a problem.    </p>    <p>      If, for instance, you rely on whatever alreadystarted      plants your local garden center happens to offer (usually      only a few of the bestknown types), you'll be lucky if you      wind up with a variety that's even <em>suited</em> to your      area. But when you turn to the catalogs to order seed, the      sheer <em>number</em> of choices can be mystifying! I've      spent the last four years testing just about <em>all</em>      the varieties of tomatoes that are commonly available . . .      and here are my recommendations for home gardens.    </p>        <p>      Tomatoes fall into several categories, differing in such      qualities as habit of growth . . . fruit size . . . and the      time required for the plant to produce a ripe harvest. The      first distinction that the home gardener should understand      is the difference between <em>determinate</em> and      <em>in</em> <em>determinate</em> plants. Determinate      tomatoes climb to a genetically decreed height and thenas      the terminal bud blooms the plants stop growing. All of the      blossoms on such a bush set fruit at about the same time,      and the harvest is concentrated within a fairly short      period . . . often no more than a week or two.    </p>    <p>      Of course, such a growth habit is fine if you want plenty      of the tangy fruit ripe all at once (say, for canning), but      if you'd like to have freshpicked sandwich and salad      fixin's over a period of several months, you'd better plant      some <em>indeterminate</em> (or staking) varieties, too. On      such vines, the terminal bud doesn't flower . . . it just      keeps on growin'. As the blossoms on the lower part of      indeter minate plants set and begin to ripen fruit, new      flowers farther up burst into bloom . . . so the crop is      produced continually until frost kills the plant. A      wellrounded garden should have a mixture of both      determinate and indeterminate plants, to provide tomatoes      for both canning and the table.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SMALL FRY</strong>    </p>    <p>      The popularity of container gardening has recently brought      a lot of attention to smallfruited tomatoes, and plant      geneticists have come up with some real winners. First      among the little fellas that grow on compact determinate      vines is <em>Pixie Hybrid</em> (Burpee, Thompson &      Morgan, Stokes), which produces wonderfully flavored 1-3/4"      fruits-on 14- to 18inch plants-in 52 days from      transplanting.    </p>    <p>      Another compact winner is Park's <em>Bitsy VF,</em> which      offers all of Pixie's fine qualities plus a resistance to      troublesome wilt diseases . . . as indicated by the "V"      (for verticillium wilt) and "F" (for fusarium wilt)      attached to its name. (Actually, some tomatoes don't      contract the diseases at all, because they're      <em>resistant</em> to verticillium and fusarium. Other      cultivars, however, are <em>tolerant</em> of the wilts . .      . which means that even though the plant may contract the      disease, its fruit crop will be largely unaffected.      Unfortunately, many seed companies seem to have confused      resistance and tolerance, and it's difficult to tell-from a      catalog description-just how immune some varieties are. All      VF tomatoes, however, are <em>at least</em> tolerant of the      wilt diseases.) Some plants also sport an "N" after the      name, indicating a resistance to infestation by nematodes .      . . the small wirelike worms that attack the roots.    </p>    <p>      Other highly recommended cultivars include <em>Patio</em>      (Park, Twilley, Hastings). which produces 2"-diameter fruit      on two oot plants in 70 days . . . City <em>Best VF</em>      (Park), an improved Patio . . . Small <em>Fry VFN</em>      (Park, Burpee), with clusters of deliciously tangysweet      fruit on threefoot vines in 65 days . . . Tiny      <em>Tire</em> (Johnny's, Nichols, Jung), which yields      little 3/4" fruits on a plant perfect for hanging baskets .      . . and <em>Droplet</em> (Farmer), a variety known for      holding its fruit on the vine when ripe.    </p>    <p>      However, not <em>all</em> small tomatoes are borne on      determinate plants. Among the season-long indeterminates      are <em>Sweet</em> 100 (Burpee, Harris, Thompson &      Morgan), the extraordinarily heavybearing All-America medal      winner that's widely admired for its flavor <em>and</em>      high vitamin C content . . . and an English import,      <em>Gardener's Delight</em> (Johnny's, Thompson &      Morgan, Burpee). The transatlantic tomato has the real      tangy flavor of the "love apples" of a century or more ago,      according to the folks at Thompson & Morgan . . . and      the bite-sized yummies can be frozen whole!    </p>    <p>      <strong>EARLY SLICERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Turning now to "normal"-sized fruit (which can range from      four ounces to well over a pound!), we'll first discuss the      early varieties . . . which-since they mature within 45 to      65 days after the transplants are set out-are a real boon      to the short-season gardener. Two determinate types lead      off the list: <em>Spring Giant VF</em> (Twilley, Park,      Stokes), which ripens finetasting eight-ounce fruit in      about 65 days . . . and <em>Ultra Girl VFN</em> (Stokes),      which yields a heavy crop of half-pound saladmakers in a      short 56 days. The <em>earliest</em> variety, however, is      undoubtedly <em>Early Girl</em> (Park, Burpee), whose five-      to six-ounce fruits mature in just 45 to 50 days . . . but      this cultivar <em>does</em> sacrifice some flavor to      produce its quick crop.    </p>    <p>      Several indeterminate types that bear early and then      <em>keep on</em> producing fruit are Big Early (Burpee), 62      days . . . Extra Early (Park), 65 days . . . and Rushmore      <em>VF</em> (Stokes, Gurney), a 66-day type that's ideal      for the West and Midwest areas of the United States.    </p>    <p>      However, a new introduction called Early <em>Cascade      VF</em> (Nichols, Park, Burpee, Stokes) has the potential      to become the leading early tomato. The plant's delicious      fruits are small (four ounces), but are produced in great      profusion <em>and</em> over a long season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAIN CROPPERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The list of mid-season (maturing within 70 to 80 days after      they're set out) determinate varieties <em>has</em> to be      headed by <em>Floramerica VF</em> (carried by most major      seed houses), the great 1978 All-America Bronze Medal      winner. This widely adapted plant (it will bear in cool,      hot, or humid weather) yields fruit weighing up to 12      ounces . . . and it's tolerant of-or resistant tosome 16      tomato diseases! Herbst is offering another strong      performer: <em>The Godfather VFN,</em> which produces      eight-ounce globes that are resistant to several diseases      <em>and</em> to blossomend rot. Other quality mid-season      determinates are Big <em>Set VFN</em> (Gurney, Twilley),      which sets halfpound fruit well even in cold weather . . .      and Bonus V <em>FN</em> (Park, Twilley, Hastings), which      produces a heavy crop in 75 days.    </p>    <p>      The mid-season indeterminates are the "main croppers"-the      tomatoes folks rely on year after year-and the yardstick by      which all others are measured is <em>Better Boy VFN</em>      (Stokes, Twilley, Park, Burpee). Better Boy <em>really      is</em> an improvement over earlier hybrids: Not only is it      one of the most disease-free tomatoes ever bred, but it's      also considered one of the finest-tasting fruits available.      This 70-day variety has been reported to yield as many as      280 1-1/2-pound fruits <em>from one vine!</em> Make a place      for it.    </p>    <p>      However, even if you choose a superb performer such as      Better Boy, it's best not to put all your tomatoes in one      basket. You can achieve diversity by planting some of the      other fine mid-season varieties as well: such as Big      <em>Girl VF</em> (Burpee), a disease-spurning relative of      Big Boy that produces one-pound fruit in 78 days . . .      Whopper <em>VFNT</em> (Park), featuring a resistance to      tobacco mosaic (smokers, take note!) and luscious 10ounce      globes in 75 days <em>. . . Red Chief VFN</em> (Hastings),      an excellent southern variety with nine-ounce fruit in 80      days <em>. . . Terrific VFN</em> (Herbst, Park, Hastings),      a rugged hybrid with good crack resistance and 10-ounce      fruit in 70 days <em>. . . He Man VF</em> (Park), a robust      plant with six-ounce tomatoes in 80 days . . .      <em>Fantastic VF</em> (Gurney, Park, Stokes), which yields      tangy eight-ouncers in 70 days ... <em>Ultra</em> Boy      <em>VFN</em> (Stokes), which-although it has one-pound      fruits that ripen in 72 days-doesn't match its sister,      Ultra Girl, in flavor . . . and <em>Nepal</em> (Farmer), a      large variety for the North.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BEEFSTEAK BROTHERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      The heavyweights form a class of their own. The huge fruits      of these late-ripening (75-90 days) indeterminate plants      are enormously popular for slicing. For years Beefsteak set      the standard for such tomatoes, but this variety is subject      to disease. Look for Beefmaster <em>VFN,</em> an improved      Beefsteak variant (from Herbst, Park, and Burpee), which      bears heavy crops of fruit weighing up to two pounds and      has a flavor that challenges that of Better Boy. Other      giants that have performed well for me include Bragger      (Park), rough-fruited but vigorous and crackresistant . . .      The Duke VF (Park), a highly productive vine which yields      fruit weighing up to two pounds in 75 days . . . Wonder Boy      <em>VF</em> (Herbst, Stokes, Twilley), which produces      onepound love apples-of excellent flavorin 80 days . . .      Supersonic <em>VF</em> (Harris), which ripens superb      half-pound fruit in 79 days . . . and <em>Pink-Skinned</em>      Jumbo (Park), an improvement over the old Ponderosa      variety.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLAYING KETCHUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      If the space allotted to tomatoes in your garden isn't      already crammed to bursting, you should consider planting      some of the plum-shaped paste types. Their fruits make      superb ketchup as well as fine tomato paste, and they're      great canners, too. Look for <em>Roma</em> VF, a 76-day      determinate variety from Park, Stokes, and Burpee . . . San      <em>Marzano</em> (Burpee, Stokes), an 80-day indeterminate      with a high percentage of solids . . . <em>Veepick</em> VF      (Stokes), an easy-peeling type with 73-day maturity . . .      and No <em>va</em> (Stokes), an early (65 days) Roma      variant.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you might also want to try a few of the yellow      varieties that are popular in many parts of the country. It      has often been claimed that yellow tomatoes -because of      their mild flavor-are low in acidity . . . but the USDA has      found that the blander flavor comes from increased sugar      content, <em>not</em> less acid. Among the popular yellow      tomatoes are <em>Sunray</em> F (Burpee, Harris, Twilley),      an 80-day indeterminate vine . . . Jubilee (Nichols, Park,      Burpee), an 80-day indeterminate that's the oldtimer among      the yellow fruit .. . and <em>Golden Delight</em> (Gurney,      Stokes), a 65-day determinate plant. You can even purchase      <em>white</em> tomatoes, but they lack both disease      resistance and fine flavor and are generally considered      only novelties.    </p>    <p>      Well, there you have it. I've listed a farm full of      reliable performers, andamong them-several certified      all-time winners. Put it this way . . . any garden that      contains some of the following can't go wrong: Sweet 100,      Ultra Girl, Better Boy, Floramerica, and Beefmaster. And      now that you've got some ideas on what to grow, take a look      at the accompanying sidebar and find out <em>how</em> to      grow 'em.

Box 65<br />      Trevose, Pennsylvania 19047    </p>    <p>      <strong>GROW 'EM FROM SEED!</strong> If you want to try      many of the tomatoes described in the accompanying article,      you're going to have to raise 'em from seed . . . since      most of the varieties mentioned just aren't often available      as alreadystarted plants. Don't be frightened off, though      ... you'll find that it's easy-as well as inexpensive-to      raise your own "starts"! Here's how:    </p>    <p>      First, get out your calendar and mark the occurrence of the      last frost in your area (you can get the information from      your county agricultural agent) . . . then count back six      to eight weeks. The date you come up with is when you      should plan to start your tomatoes-to-be.    </p>    <p>      To germinate the seeds, you'll need some soilless mix (sold      under such names as Jiffy Mix, Pro-Mix, Metro Mix, or      Terra-Lite Tomato Soil . . . and available through seed      catalogs and garden centers), some seed flats to hold the      mix, plastic bags for "instant greenhouses" to enclose the      flats in, milled <em>sphagnum</em> moss <em>(not</em> peat      moss), and a source of mild-75 to 80°F is idealheat:      Use an electric heating pad, tray, or cable . .. or a      well-insulated radiator or heat pipe,    </p>    <p>      Now fill the fiats with the soilless mix and dampen 'em      well . . . sow the seeds on top (spaced an inch apart) and      cover them with a half-inch layer of milled sphagnum . . .      wet the moss thoroughly . . . put each flat in a plastic      bag. . . close the sacks with twist-ties ... and place the      "incubators" on the heat source. The sphagnum moss will      prevent dampingoff disease, the plastic bags will retain      the moisture so you won't have to water until the little      plants are up, and the heat <em>will really</em> speed up      germination. In fact, you can expect the seedlings to      become visible in about a week.    </p>    <p>      Once the young'uns are up, brace the plastic covering so      the plants don't touch the damp material (the bag can be      discarded when the seedlings are about a week old), remove      the flat from the heat source, and grow the sprouts-at      about 60°F-an inch or two under a twin-tube 40watt      fluorescent light fixture. (The lamplight "day" should be      between 14 and 16 hours long.) Raise the little plants      under these conditions until they're two to three inches      tall and have at least one set of true leaves (not just the      cotyledons that are the first to appear). At that point,      you'll be ready to perform the first transplanting.    </p>    <p>      Gather together some three-inch flowerpots (plastic cups      will also work fine), fill them with the soilless mix,      andcarefullylift the seedlings from their trays and place      them In their new homes. In transferring them, set the      immature plants deeper than they were growing in the flat.      . . even if you have to nip off the lower leaves. Tomatoes      have the ability to sprout roots all along their buried      stems, so deep planting will help produce substantial root      systems. Feed the seedlings each time you water by giving      them a <em>quarter-strength dose</em> of soluble houseplant      fertilizer, and continue growing the young vines under the      lights until they are about 10 inches tall.    </p>    <p>      Now it's time for the <em>second trans</em> planting ...      this time into half-gallon milk cartons (or similar-sized      containers). Again set the plants deep: Remove all the      lower leaves, and-with the roots touching the bottom of the      carton-bury the denuded stem almost up to the top.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the entire purpose of double transplanting is to      produce stocky plants with substantial root systems,      <em>not</em> to rush fruiting. So, if the vines do develop      flowers or fruit before it's time to set them out, it's      best (although the act can break your heart) to pinch off      the precocious buds. As the folks at Johnny's Selected      Seeds point out in their 1980 catalog, if such surgery      <em>isn't</em> done, the plants may remain stunted and      produce only a few small, poor-quality fruits when they're      placed in the garden.    </p>    <p>      After the last frost, begin to harden off the plants. Omit      a watering or two, and then place the seedlings (still in      their containers) in a sheltered, semishaded place in the      garden for three or four days . . . bringing the plants in      at night. Then, for the <em>toliowing</em> week or so,      allow the plants to remain in a sheltered spot in the      garden <em>overnight.</em> While the young vines are      hardening off, you'll have time to prepare the bed (if you      didn't do so the previous fall). Take a soil test, and      adjust for a pH of 6 to 6.9 . . . adding lime if the soil      is too acidic (the calcium will help prevent blossom-end      rot, too) and sulfur if it's too alkaline.    </p>    <p>      Tomatoes are particularly fond of organic matter, so try to      incorporate large amounts of compost or      <em>well-rotted</em> (not fresh) manure as you work the      plot to a depth of ten inches. If your soil test indicated      a need for fertilizer, remember that a low nitrogen -mix is      best: Look for a 510-10 blend.    </p>    <p>      Then, if you live in a region with a balmy spring and a      scorching summer, place the transplants in compost-lined      holes deep enough to cover each vine almost to its top set      of leaves. Nip off the lower fronds, wrap a three-inch      strip of newspaper around the stem as a cutworm collar      (half above the soil line and half below), set the plant in      the hole, fill and firm the soil, and water it well. The      deep root run will be shielded from summer's heat and.      dryness, and belowground moisture will always be available      to the plant.    </p>    <p>      If, on the other hand, you live in a <em>colder</em> area,      try the trench planting method advocated by Dick Raymond in      his <em>Down-loEarth Vegetable Gardening Know-How</em>      (Garden Way, 1975 . . . available for $5.95 from most      bookstores orfor the listed price plus 95d shipping and      handling-from Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739). Dick suggests      digging a three-inch-deep trench, placing a halfinch layer      of compost or aged manure in the bottom, and then laying      the transplant (after pinching off all but the topmost      cluster of leaves) on its side in the groove. Cover the      stem with soil, propping up the tomato's top with a little      pillow of earth, and water it well. Mother Nature will soon      have the plant growing straight and tall; while the roots      that form along the stem will be basking in the sun's      warmth under their shallow earthen blanket.    </p>    <p>      No matter <em>which</em> system of planting you choose,      you'll still have to decide how-and if-you want to support      your plants. If you're raising <em>determinate</em>      tomatoes, there's little problem. The sturdy but compact      growers hold their own heads up high, and little or no help      is necessary (although sometimes a minimal two-foot cage is      useful). <em>Indeter</em> minate plants can become huge,      though, and-unless you're willing to let the big vines      sprawl (with the attendant waste of space and rotting      fruit)you'll probably choose either staking or cages as a      method of support.    </p>    <p>      Staking starts easily but requires additional work later.      Use an eight-foot 2 X 2 for the prop, and drive it in next      to the plant-downwind from the prevailing breezeat      transplanting time. That's the easy part . . . now comes      the work: pruning and tying up. The main stem must be tied      to the pole. Use <em>soft</em> cloth or twine, or plastic      tape . . . and tie the stalk loosely, of course, to avoid      girdling (and killing) the plant. (One excellent scrounged      tying material is old nylon stocking or pantyhose fabric .      . . !t has enough give to avoid choking the vine.) Then, as      suckers-or new branches-develop where the old limbs meet      the stem, the new growth must be pinched out. Let a cou ple      of leaves develop on the sucker, and then prune above the      leaves . . . to better protect the fruit from the sun.    </p>    <p>      Caging the plants, on the other hand, requires more work up      front . .. but virtually no maintenance later. The real      labor is in making the cages, for which you should use      'large-meshed (five-inch or greater) concrete-reinforcing      or hog wire. The ideal cage size seems to be two feet in      diameter and five feet tall, so you'll need to cut a 8'4"      length of five-foot fencing to work with. Form the wire      into a cylinder and crimp the ends to each other to ensure      stability.    </p>    <p>      You can anchor the cage to the ground by using wooden      stakes or wire attached to the bottom of the support . . .      or you 5 can remove the bottom layer of crosspieces and      push the vertical prongs into the earth. That's it! The      plant will be contained and supported by the cage without      any pruning (or other action) on your part. Now all you      have to do is to keep the vines fed and watered and the      bugs picked off . . . and to harvest-in the fullness of      time-a bumper crop of succulent red tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> Ortho <em>Publications</em> has      <em>produced a beautifully illustrated and wellwritten (if      you ignore</em> the pesticide bias) <em>book entitled      All</em> About Tomatoes, <em>which will</em> answer just      <em>about</em> any <em>question you</em> might have      concerning the fruit.
