        <p id="byline">I knew that saving a couple of billion gallons of water a day wouldn't be an easy task, but the present world water shortage-compounded by the problems of disposal, pollution, and humankind's generally wasteful habits-caused me to set my brilliant mind to work. Surely, I thought, I could find a solution, save America . . . and (ahem!) maybe make a few bucks in the bargain!</p><p>I must have flushed my toilet-a device that I know is a legendary waterwaster-a hundred times in one day while researching the problem. My poor well gave a hollow echo as it dried up from overuse . . . and just as the last droplets dribbled slowly into the tank, my own sudden water shortage provided inspiration. I had the answer! My idea was, in fact, so simple that I wondered why no one had ever thought of it before. Since only about a third of a tank is necessary to flush away liquid waste efficiently, why do modern commodes use a whole tankful of water to do so? What's needed, I figured, is a two-way toilet flush valve: Turn it one way for solid waste and the opposite way for liquid waste!</p><p>In order to get a rough notion of the worth of such a device, I contacted the Philadelphia Water Department, which informed me that it costs almost $500 to purify and then dispose of one million gallons of "used" water. By my own estimate, I calculated that each American flushes five times a day: twice for solid wastes and three times for liquids. (I didn't even count those folks who use five gallons of pure water to get rid of cigarette butts, and I left out about 25 million little children . . . as well as people with outhouses and an assortment of other nonflushers.)</p><p>On the basis of those figures, I quickly recognized that a two-way valve could save ten gallons per person daily. Then, by multiplying that amount by an estimated 200 million people in the U.S. who use conventional commodes, I concluded that two billion gallons of pure drinking water per day wouldn't need to be taken from our streams and wells . . . wouldn't have to be treated with chemicals . . . and wouldn't eventually be dumped into our rivers. Furthermore, at an average processing cost of $500 per million gallons, the dollars saved each day would total a nice round million . . . or $365 million a year. If I got only a 5% royalty on the money saved by my invention, I'd be in the megabucks, earning over $18 million a year.</p><p>But wait . . . aside from asking for a commission on the water conserved, I'd naturally expect a 10% cut on the sales of the valve itself. At $20 a unit times 100 million, my take would be a round $200 million! The figures were so astronomical that I became afraid to tell anyone about my invention. Just consider . . . how could I be sure the patent lawyer wouldn't have me erased when I explained my idea? How could I even trust my best friend with the concept? How could I get a manufacturer to develop the valve without the risk of being measured for a new pair of concrete shoes while he or she prepared to rake in my money?</p><p>Despite such fears, I forced myself to take a train to Washington, D.C. and the Metro over to Crystal City in Alexandria, Virginia . . . to the home of the U.S. Patent Office. The people there were most cordial-too cordial for my liking-and I immediately became suspicious: After all, why were they working at the patent office if not to steal people's ideas? I was assigned to a smooth-talking, shifty-looking assistant who immediately asked me about my invention.</p><p>"Hold on!" I told him. "I want help, but I don't want to tell you anything about my idea. I don't trust anybody' "</p><p>He grinned an all-knowing smile and sat back . . . seemingly willing to wait as long as necessary for me to resolve the stalemate.</p><p>After a minute or two of electrically charged silence, I tried an oblique approach and mentioned that I was interested in conservation. He sat up-fairly twitching with eagerness-and inquired whether I wanted to save land, trees, people, buildings, food, or water. I gave a start when he mentioned water, and he smirked to himself.</p><p>"So, you want to save water, do you?" the assistant asked, with the manner of a stalking puma. "Is it in garden hoses? No. Perhaps a new kind of dam system that no one has ever thought of before?" His eyes burned into mine as I sat transfixed in the chair, too shocked to move or even talk. The inquisitor went on to reel off a string of possible ways to conserve water. "Do you want to spread a thin sheet of oil on the oceans to control evaporation? No, I guess not. I suppose you might want to save water in waste disposal." (I just about fell off my seat. I hadn't said a word for ten minutes. It was the slickest interrogation I'd seen.)</p><p>"Well, in that case," he went on, "I imagine you're interested in some sort of two-way flush valve for toilets. They're all on file on the second floor, third rack from the elevator. Here's the classification number. If I remember rightly, the first two-way valve was invented around the turn of the century. Now if you have any more questions, or if I can help you in any way, please come back to my office. Perhaps we can have a cup of coffee and talk about your particular application."</p><p>I gave the man a bewildered nod . . . thanked him dully . . . staggered from his office . . . found the second floor and the third bank from the elevator. . . and, in a daze, shuffled through a veritable mountain of two-way flush patents. A further search on the computer turned up 30 more designs that were first cousins to my idea. Still in shock, I photostated a half-dozen at random, stuffed them into my (now unchained) briefcase, and stopped to thank the assistant.</p><p>As I finished my coffee and rose to leave, the patent aide said, "You know, I've always wondered why the government never did anything with two-way valves . . . especially now, with today's water shortages and expensive waste treatment. Why, if Uncle Sam mandated that all federal buildings and federally financed construction install such devices, we could probably save a billion gallons of water a day . . . maybe even two billion! Well, it was a pleasure meeting you, and if you have any more ideas, you hurry on back, hear?"</p>
