                <p>      The health threat posed by toxic metals was recently      brought only too close to home, when a group of urban crop      raisers discovered a connection between...    </p>        <p>      <em>. . . if we're letting the lead industry get</em>      <em>away with dangerous pollution, we should do something      about the lead industry ... "</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dr. John Gofman,<br /></strong> <strong>MOTHER NO.      67, page 121</strong>    </p>		    <p>      Some 5,000 years ago, the human race smelted the first      lead-silver alloys, and thus began soiling its own nest      with the heavy metal. In fact, at the high point in their      history, the Romans were using so much lead in pots and      aqueducts (indeed, the very word "plumbing" comes from the      Latin word for lead, plumbum) that the toxic element may      well have contributed to the downfall of their empire. Yet      in spite of the fact that people have long recognized the      health dangers of processing and using lead, we now mine      and employ an almost astronomical quantity of the metal.      (Compare the 80,000 tons of lead produced each year during      Roman times to the 3,000,000 tons      produced-annually-today!)    </p>    <p>      Lead is, in short, omnipresent in modern society (the metal      has even polluted the polar icecap), and perhaps that's the      reason most of us have seemingly forgotten that it exists.      We're constantly exposed to the heavy metal, in the form of      house paints . . . industrial emissions . . . exhaust from      automobiles . . . colored ink in newspapers, magazines,      comic books, and even candy wrappers ... ceramic glazes ...      the solder used to seal food cans . . . old water pipes . .      . and more.    </p>    <p>      But a new grounds-well of concern about the dangers      of this widespread element is beginning to take hold in our      country. And the movement was spawned, ironically, by an      investigation of one of the least suspected means of human      lead ingestion . . . gardening.    </p>    <p>      Now you may well be shocked by the notion that growing      one's own food-an The health threat posed by toxic      metals was recently brought only too close to home, when a      group of urban crop raisers discovered a connection      between. . . activity that's come to be symbolic of      wholesome, self-reliant living-can actually be hazardous to      human health. But don't get too alarmed. Lead toxicity is a      problem only in some gardens and for some people (primarily      small children) . . . and, as we'll explain, the hazard can      be identified and dealt with in those instances. However,      there is real cause for concern about all the means by      which lead finds its way into your own and your children's      lives, especially since many other sources of exposure to      the toxic element are likely much more significant than is      any that can come from a home vegetable plot.    </p>    <p>      It was a group of gardeners, though, who recently rekindled      public awareness of the lead issue . . . and it's those      same horticulturists-members of an organization of      community gardeners in Boston, Massachusetts-who are      working hard to educate people about the numerous ways      (including crop raising) in which families may be exposed      to harmful levels of the metal. The purpose of this      article, then, will be to share some of what many such      health-conscious people have learned, so you can      effectively reduce the sources of exposure to lead in your      own life.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE EFFECTS OF LEAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      Although many of the facts of this complex issue are      obscured by controversy or ignorance, no one-not even the      most ardent defenders of America's lead industries-would      deny that, at high levels of exposure, the element labeled      "Pb" is dangerously toxic. Victims of "clinical" lead      poisoning (which is also called plumbism) can suffer      headaches, nausea, anemia, kidney damage, blindness,      hemorrhage, convulsions, coma, and death.    </p>    <p>      Another undisputed truth is the fact that children under      six (including, since lead crosses the placenta, infants      still in utero) are far more susceptible to lead poisoning      than are adults. Youngsters have high metabolic rates, are      at delicate stages of growth, and are often physically      close to such sources of lead as old paint chips,      contaminated dirt, and auto exhaust. All told, children's      bodies can absorb and retain around 40% of the lead that      they ingest . . . while adults can eliminate all but a      small percentage of the element that gets into their      systems. Consequently, youngsters are much more likely than      adults to develop serious lead poisoning. Of course, men      and women employed in lead smelting, storage battery      manufacturing, shipbuilding, automotive body painting,      printing, deleading, pottery glazing, and other leadrelated      industries or crafts may-because of the high levels      of exposure in such occupations-suffer clinical lead      poisoning, as well.    </p>    <p>      But the accepted truths don't tell the whole story of lead      intoxication. Recent evidence indicates that even Pb      intakes well below established clinical levels can      seriously harm children. Youngsters with lowlevel lead      exposure are sometimes afflicted with headaches and      abdominal pain ... or such "lesser" symptoms as      irritability, clumsiness, listlessness, and loss of      appetite.    </p>    <p>      And, sadly enough, the organ most easily affected in a      growing child is the brain. Dr. Herbert L. Needleman      carefully compared the levels of lead in children's teeth      (the heavy metal accumulates in teeth and bone) with the      same youths' rating by various testing systems and teacher      evaluations. (The results were reported in the March 29,      1979 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.) He      discovered that low levels of absorbed lead can decrease a      child's attention span, impair his or her auditory and      language-processing abilities, promote poor social      behavior, and-in a word-reduce the youngster's      intelligence.    </p>    <p>      Worse yet, the brain damage caused in young children by      "subclinical" lead poisoning is often irreversible.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEADED GARDENS?</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the strongest recent efforts to combat the hazards      of lead exposure began in 1977, when a few members of the      Boston Urban Gardeners (BUG)-an organization      dedicated to revitalizing communities and people's lives by      means of vegetable growing-became worried that some      soil might contain enough lead to endanger small children.      The BUG members, along with concerned scientists and public      agency representatives, investigated the subject and      demanded that their city's public services address the      problem. The group's dogged efforts paid off handsomely,      too: Boston (and the state of Massachusetts as a whole) now      offers soil-lead testing, bloodlead testing, and related      health information to all of its residents.    </p>    <p>      The Boston task force raised the question of whether plants      could absorb lead that's present in garden soil. To find      the answer, Thomas H. Spittler and William A. Feder      cultivated lettuce, beets, carrots, snap beans, and      radishes-in a carefully controlled greenhouse      environment-during the winter of 1977-78. They found (and      published their findings in "A Study of Soil Contamination      and Plant Lead Uptake in Boston Urban Gardens",      Communications in Soil Science and Plant Analysis, 1979) "a      definite correlation between soil Pb content and plant      uptake" . . . and the pair went on to observe that the      element tended to concentrate primarily in plant leaves, to      a lesser extent in roots, and hardly at all in fruits.      (Hence, tomatoes absorb much less lead from soil than do      potatoes, which-in turn-take in less than does      spinach.)    </p>    <p>      More important, though, Spittler and Feder also expressed a      possibility that other researchers soon verified: If one's      garden soil is so toxic that the plants can absorb a      measurably significant amount of lead, the earth itself is      more of a health threat to children than are the crops! As      research agronomist and heavy-metal expert Rufus L. Chaney      put it, "We think we have confirmed that plants don't take      up enough lead to matter, as far as its getting into      people's diets is concerned. The really big risk is soil      ingestion by children." After all, youngsters play in dirt      . . . they're likely to get some on their hands and      accidentally ingest contaminated soil in the course of      normal hand-to-mouth play, or-in some      cases-even develop the habit of deliberately eating      soil (and other nonfoods ... a pattern of behavior called      `pica").    </p>    <p>      Essentially, then, gardening in lead-con taminated areas      can constitute a health risk to young children (although      not, at least so far as we now know, to adults) . . . and      this threat comes primarily from the soil itself, rather      than from the plants per se. (Indeed, more lead is likely      to accumulate on the surface of crops-from settled      auto exhaust fumes and garden dirt-than will collect      inside the vegetables.)    </p>    <p>      The problem of toxic soil is not a shortterm one, either.      The metal does not tend to percolate down through the      ground, but instead settles in the top few inches of earth,      where it can remain for centuries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHERE DOES IT COME FROM?</strong>    </p>    <p>      And just how does one's garden plotor yard-build up a      dangerous level of lead to begin with? There are several      possible means of contamination, and their relative      importance will vary from site to site . . . but the most      likely source of severe lead buildup is house paint. Until      1950, you see, almost all homes were protected with paints      that contained dangerous amounts of lead. (In fact, some      home coatings used for years after that date -right up to      1971-were formulated with lesser, but still      significant, doses of the metal.) And even though old      buildings may have since been repainted, several times,      with less toxic coverings, the original lead-based exterior      layer can still shed the dangerous element into the soil.      Chips of the material may drop off ... and rain      will-over time-wash some lead down from even      nonpeeling walls. Or, worse yet, a lead-painted building      may have been burned or demolished-years ago-on what's now      a gardening site.    </p>    <p>      Lead is deposited in the soil in many other ways, as well.      In areas near heavily traveled roads, auto exhaust fumes      can contribute an appreciable amount of the toxic substance      to the earth. Emissions from factories that use lead in      their manufacturing processes can constitute a very      significant local Pb source. Even treated sludge can      contaminate-rather than fertilize-garden soil.    </p>    <p>      You may be surprised to know that, contrary to popular      myth, lead-sullied soil is not only an urban problem . . .      rural folks need to be concerned about it, too. Any country      vegetable plot that's next to-or receives rain runoff      from-an old painted house or barn will most likely      contain an above-average level of lead. Farm plots,      like city gardens, can be located close to frequently      traveled roadways or downwind from industrial lead-using      factories. On top of that, the ground may have received an      extra burden of lead if its owner has-at one time or      another-spread wood ashes from painted boards on his or her      garden site.    </p>    <p>      A rural growing plot may also be significantly contaminated      if the soil was formerly commercial farm acreage: For many      years, lead arsenate was a common ingredient in pesticides      (particularly in those insecticides used in orchards).    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BLOOD TEST</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you can see, having lead-contaminated ground can      increase the amount of exposure that your children will      have to the toxic metal, but remember: Human beings absorb      lead from many sources.    </p>    <p>      Therefore, it's important that concerned parents determine      whether or not their youngsters are ingesting and retaining      harmful amounts of lead, regardless of the environmental      source. Fortunately, there is a way to determine the amount      of the dangerous element currently entering any person's      system: a blood test.    </p>    <p>      To get your own or your child's blood checked for lead      content, first contact your nearest health department and      ask whether it offers this service. (If the agency does so,      the testing may well be performed free of charge.) Should      the folks there not be equipped to handle this exam, ask      them-or your family doctor-who, in your region,      does have the capability. One of those parties should be      able to find out, take your blood sample, and send it off      for testing. If, however, neither your physician nor the      health department can locate a blood-lead testing service,      write the Department of Health and Human Services, Public      Health Service, Center for Disease Control, Dept. TMEN,      Atlanta, Georgia 30333. Someone at that agency will send      you the address of the testing center nearest you.    </p>    <p>      A blood-lead test will be either a fingerstick exam (in      which blood is taken from a pricked finger) or a venous      test (in which the sample is drawn from a vein in the arm).      Both types give an erythrocyte protoporphyrin, or EP,      reading. (Protoporphyrin is a substance that accumulates in      the bloodstream's erythrocytes-the red blood      cells-when excess body lead interferes with normal      hemoglobin production. An EP test, then, is a good      indicator of the extent to which lead is currently      affecting one's body.) EP results are given in micrograms      of protoporphyrin per 100 deciliters of blood (mcg/100dl).      A reading below 50mcg/100dl is currently considered to be a      "normal" EP level, while counts of 50-249 mcg/100dl and      250+mcg/100dl are considered "excessive" and "dangerous",      respectively.    </p>    <p>      The venous blood test measures the bloodlead level as well      as an EP count. A level of below 30 micrograms of lead per      100 deciliters of blood is currently considered acceptable.      (The Boston Urban Gardeners people warn that it's best to      take that "acceptable" designation with a grain of salt,      however .. . since it is now suspected that blood-lead      levels as low as 10mcg/100di may cause some damage to a      child!) Readings of 30-49mcg/100dl, 50-69mcg/100dl, and      70+mcg/100dl are officially categorized as "elevated",      "excessive", and "dangerous", respectively.    </p>    <p>      Both types of blood test indicate the level of lead      currently circulating through a person's body. The      advantage of such readings is that they offer means of      gauging change: You can quickly discern how much lead your      children are ingesting, then find out, through subsequent      tests, whether you've been successful in reducing that      toxic intake. The limitation of the exams-on the      other hand-is that they don't provide figures for the      total amount of previously absorbed lead that may have      permanently accumulated in the body.    </p>    <p>      To insure that your own children are safe from low-level      lead intake, you should test youngsters aged six months to      three years-and your older offspring, if you live in      a high-risk area-once every six months. Most children      beyond three years of age require only a yearly checkup.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT TO DO</strong>    </p>    <p>      If blood test results indicate that a child of yours has an      excessive or dangerous lead level, you should see a doctor      for im mediate treatment of this serious poisoning problem.      If, however, the results indicate no more than a possibly      elevated blood-lead count, take measures (such as those      described below) to reduce the amount of lead the youngster      ingests, and use a series of doctor visits and follow-up      blood tests to see how successful your efforts are.      According to the Center for Disease Control in Atlanta, the      child's blood lead should remain stabilized at a safe level      for six months before the parent can feel that he or she is      effectively dealing with the problem. (Keep in mind, too,      that a youngster's blood-lead level will often fluctuate on      a seasonal pattern ... and tend to be highest during those      let's-playoutdoors summer months.)    </p>    <p>      And, of course, whatever steps you take to reduce the lead      in your child's environment, be aware of the possibility of      exposure to the metal in your garden's soil, along with the      other potential sources of ingestion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GARDENING WITH LEAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      According to the Boston Urban Gardeners' Julie Stone, you      can feel pretty sure that your soil has a high lead level      if it's [1] located next to an old painted building, [2] on      the site of a former building or dump, or [3] in an area      that's heavily contaminated by auto or lead industry      exhaust. Should any of the above conditions apply to your      garden, it's best-for the safety of young children or any      other persons in your household who face high levels of      lead exposure in their occupations-to grow all vegetables      in containers . . . find another, safer gardening site ...      or have the topsoil replaced with clean earth. You should      also make sure any exposed garden dirt can't become a      health hazard by covering it with gravel or with a tough      grass such as K-31 fescue.    </p>    <p>      It's much more difficult to "guesstimate" whether your      garden may have an elevated (rather than high) lead level.      If the plot is in an area that's not far from an old      painted building or is subject to regular smog or some auto      exhaust, though, you will probably want to take the      following gardening precautions .. . to protect any      lead-risk family members:    </p>    <p>      *Grow leafy green vegetables and root crops as far as      possible from busy roads or older houses.    </p>    <p>      *Use fences or tall plantings of sunflowers, morning      glories, or dwarf fruit trees to help cut down the amount      of airborne lead that reaches your garden.    </p>    <p>      *Wash all produce (especially the fruit grown to provide an      airborne lead "windbreak") thoroughly before eating .. .      and discard 'the outer leaves of lettuce, cabbage, chard,      etc.    </p>    <p>      *Peel all root crops before eating them.    </p>    <p>      *Enrich the soil with peat moss, compost, or manure. The      organic matter will help you raise healthier, more      nourishing plants . . . and add uncontaminated growing      medium to your soil.    </p>    <p>      *Mulch the garden. Aside from helping plants thrive, the      covering will keep airborne lead off the soil. (If your      garden site is exposed to a lot of poisonous exhaust,      discard the mulch at the end of the growing season instead      of composting the material or tilling it into the ground      ... to avoid adding the accumulated lead to the garden.)    </p>    <p>      *Adjust the soil pH until it's as close to neutral as your      crops will tolerate. It's been suggested that a neutral pH      will tend to inhibit lead uptake by plants grown in soil      with a moderately low level of lead.    </p>    <p>      *Add phosphorus to your soil ... because Pb will often bind      to that mineral and form the safe substance, lead      phosphate. (In fact, research agronomist Dr. Rufus L.      Chaney believes that neutralizing an acidic plot without      adding extra phosphorus might even be counter-productive .      . . since the increased alkalinity will tend to render      ineffective whatever amounts of the leadbinding element are      already in the soil.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIRT AND DUST</strong>    </p>    <p>      Besides following the foregoing gardening suggestions, a      person who's trying to reduce local heavy metal      contamination in his or her area should also wage war      against the amount of leaded dirt and dust a child may be      exposed to while at home or at play. (Such Pb "carriers"      frequently are among the major contributors to lead      poisoning in children.)    </p>    <p>      To do so, the members of the Boston Urban Gardeners      recommend that you always wash your children's hands before      the youngsters eat and after they've been playing in any      dirty area . . . build a sandbox so they'll have a spot to      play that doesn't contain contaminated soil ... be sure      your tots sit at a table when eating outdoors (a couple of      boards set on crates will do fine) . . . grow a tough grass      ground cover in dusty areas . . . place old rags or mats      over scruff spots such as the earth under swings and at the      bottom of slides ... and get rid of any paint chips found      near buildings. It's also important to keep the interior of      your home as dust-free as possible, by thoroughly wiping      furniture and sweeping and wet mopping floors. In addition,      if any member of your family works in a lead-related      industry, that person should always shower, shampoo, and      change to clean clothes and shoes before coming home.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIET CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the most positive steps you can take to reduce the      amount of lead your children absorb is to make sure the      youngsters have healthful diets. Iron and calcium, in      particular, are very effective in combating lead retention      in the body. Foods high in iron include dried fruits, dark      leafy vegetables, and red meat .. . while dairy products,      some nuts, and most vegetables are good sources of calcium.    </p>    <p>      It may be best, though, to reduce the amount of canned      foods your child eats, since the solder used to seal the      cans may contain significant amounts of lead. Indeed,      according to Dorothy M. Settle and Clair C. Patterson's      estimates (in "Lead in Albacore: Guide to Lead Pollution in      Americans", Science, March 14, 1980), "Half the lead in the      American diet proba bly originates from lead-soldered      cans." So it's actually possible that a person could get      more toxic metal from a tinned tomato than from one grown      in his or her own leadcontaminated garden!    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, since Settle and Patterson made their study,      many canning companies have started to drastically reduce      the amount of lead solder in their containers, so the      possibility that leaded cans may contribute significantly      to lead accumulation may be fading. Two particular canned      foods definitely worth avoiding, though, are citric juices      that have stood, opened, in the refrigerator a few days and      tinned infant formula. (Aluminum cans may be safe, but we      don't recommend them.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PIPES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Older homes, and some old municipal water systems, may have      lead waterlines, and such pipes can be another source of      the toxic element (particularly in regions with soft      water). People trying to reduce their family's lead intake      should-if their drinking water comes through lead      pipes-consume bottled water . . . use a water      treatment unit approved for lead removal by the EPA . . .      or, at the very least, run the tap for a few seconds before      drawing any liquid for drinking and cooking purposes. (You      should be able to get your water tested for lead content by      your local Public Health Service, water pollution control      agency, or even a person or organization who does      blood-lead testing.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>PAINT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Without a doubt, though, the easiest way for any child to      get an extremely high dose of lead is by ingesting      lead-based paint. So, besides cleaning up paint chips      inside and around your home, you may-if the house was      at one time coated with such a paintwant to cover the      interior walls with paneling or wallpaper, or remove the      toxic coating entirely.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to get rid of the leadbased paint, be      absolutely sure you take all the proper precautions. Don't      use a power sander (which would create dangerous dust) or      burn the old coating off (which, worse yet, would vaporize      the toxic matter). Instead, remove the paint by dry      scraping only. Use a dropcloth, wear a respirator, keep the      work area and workers clean, change clothes after working,      and eat in a separate space ... in other words, follow      strict sanitary measures. In addition, make absolutely      certain that children and pregnant or nursing women stay      away from the work area. There have been numerous reported      cases of well-intentioned home remodelers who received      damaging doses of lead while deleading their houses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOIL TESTING</strong>    </p>    <p>      One of the most positive lead-control actions any concerned      person can take is to help organize a community      soil-testing program. There are very few parts of the      country right now where an individual can easily get his or      her cropping ground tested for lead content . . . but that      state of affairs can be changed.    </p>    <p>      The best-known example of a successful community soil-lead      testing program is, as you'd imagine, the one in Boston. As      BUG's Julie Stone describes it, the folks there were able      to convince the extension service and other government      agencies to set up soil- and blood-lead testing services,      partially because they rallied concerned scientists and      agency officials to their cause . . . but primarily as a      result of "a handful of committed individuals who learned      never to take no for an answer".    </p>    <p>      While gathering support from a number of determined people      might well be the best way to initiate a lead-testing      movement where you live, Linda Roth-of the Suffolk      County, Massachusetts Agricultural Extension      Service-advises that you will also have to track down      a facility that has the type of (expensive)      spectrophotometer that can run accurate soil-lead tests.      Linda suggests that you first contact those experienced      soil testers, the folks at your county extension service,      to see whether they have the needed equipment on hand.    </p>    <p>      Other places that might be able to provide access to the      machine are state agricultural extension programs,      university science labs (you could even be fortunate enough      to find a graduate student interested in testing soils as      part of his or her research work), state health boards,      regional labs of the Environmental Protection Agency, state      pollution control agencies, and private medical or research      labs. Indeed, the Boston Urban Gardeners located one of      their first testing facilities at a private laboratory . ..      after one of the members read a newspaper article about a      researcher who was looking into lead levels in pet foods!    </p>    <p>      If your group needs further advice on how to organize a      successful soil-testing service, contact Linda Roth, Dept.      TMEN, Suffolk County Extension Service, University of      Massachusetts Downtown Center, 100 Arlington Street, Room      908, Boston, Massachusetts 02125. Linda regrets that she      simply doesn't have time to handle in dividual lead-related      queries, but has graciously offered to do all she can to      help lead-activist groups get off the ground.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE BIG PICTURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Evidence of the hazards of lead contamination keeps      mounting steadily ... but unfortunately, the amount of the      toxic element being added to our total environment is also      ever on the increase. Conscientious measures to help      protect one's own garden soil, family, and community are      important, but individual efforts obviously aren't enough      to remedy the situation. We all need to take action to meet      the problem at its source: that is, to reduce the amount of      the toxic metal being spewed throughout our country.    </p>    <p>      And, as a first step, you should know about some pending      government decisions that may cause serious setbacks to      much of the progress that has been made in combating      environmental lead contamination in the U.S.    </p>    <p>      [1] The Clean Air Act of 1970 is up for revision this year.      This major piece of legislation has helped regulate the      amount of airborne particulates, sulfur dioxide, carbon      monoxide, hydrocarbons, nitrogen dioxide, ozone . . . and      lead introduced into the environment. There are many      interests that would like to see the important restrictions      of the Clean Air Act substantially weakened.    </p>    <p>      [2] The 1978 Lead Standard. The Labor Department's      Occupational Safety and Health Administration (headed by      Thorne Auchter) wants to replace "maximum protection of      workers" as the standard for pollution in lead industries      with a "costbenefit analysis" of individual safety      measures. The proposed slackening of health controls could      affect 835,000 American workers in at least 120      occupations.    </p>    <p>      [3] The 1971 Lead-Based Paint Poisoning Prevention Act. Run      primarily by the Center for Disease Control, the program      established under this act has already screened 3,475,659      children and referred 227,904-that's more than a      quarter of a million!youngsters to pediatric care for      treatment of elevated blood-lead levels. This vital public      health aid has been extended and expanded three times since      its inception . . . but is now slated to expire this      November.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to help create public pressure for the      continued reduction of lead in the air and the workplace,      or for the reestablishment of our only nationally effective      lead-screening program for children, you may want to write      your elected federal representatives and voice your      concerns. (You can find out the names and addresses of      these individuals by phoning your local public library.)    </p>    <p>      Lead poisoning is the number one neurological disease of      children in this country. Yet even today, scientists admit      (as Dr. Jane S. Lin-Fu pointed out in the January/February      1979 issue of Children Today) that it's "a uniquely      neglected public health problem". Furthermore, lead      poisoning is especially insidious because so often it slips      by unidentified . . . damaging children's health and mental      potential without anyone's even knowing the harm has      occurred!    </p>    <p>      It's simply not enough to try, like an ostrich, to isolate      yourself by hiding your head in the ground. After all, even      that soil may not be safe anymore!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: The National Center for Appropriate      Technology has just published a booklet, compiled by the      Boston Urban Gardeners, that outlines the dangers of lead      poisoning and the steps you can take to garden more safely.      It's available for 50 cents postpaid from Lead Booklet,      National Center for Appropriate Technology, Publications      Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 3838, Butte, Montana 59702.    </p>    <p>      In addition, the Center for Disease Control (Department of      Health and Human Services, Public Health Service, Center      for Disease Control, Dept. TMEN, Atlanta, Georgia 30333)      offers two free handouts on lead: a reprint of Dr. Lin-Fu's      "What Price Shall We Pay for Lead Poisoning in Children?"      (which contains a history of the problem) and Preventing      Lead Poisoning in Young Children (a technical booklet-for      physicians and health service personnel-covering cause,      identification, and treatment of plumbism).    </p>    <p>      MOTHER would like to thank the Boston Urban Gardeners      (particularly Charlotte Kahn and Julie Stone), Rufus L. Cha      ney, Linda Roth, the Center for Disease Control, NCAT's      Nancy Goodman, and especially Ben Barber-who alerted      us to the seriousness of the lead poisoning issue-for      their kind help in gathering much of the information for      this article.    </p>
