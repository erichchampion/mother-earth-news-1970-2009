                		<hr />    <p>      The shimmering heat of summer lies heavy upon the land. As      parading thunderheads pile high in the sky, wait for the      first fat drops of precious rain to release the earth's      rich fragrance. Later-after the soil's thirst is slaked and      the storm rumbles away-feast on fresh corn, beans, cabbage,      and tomatoes, and give thanks for the season . . . and for      the goodness of the garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUMMER IN THE GARDEN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Beginning with this issue, we'll try-on      occasion-to bring you detailed gardening suggestions,      tailored to the USDA climate zones shown on the color map.      Of course, regional variations exist just about everywhere,      and advice that's suitable for a general location may have      to be modified to suit any <em>particular</em> site. Still,      you should find our suggestions pretty close to the mark      for your region. Just add your knowledge of local      conditions, and get gardening!    </p>        <p>      <strong>ZONE THREE</strong></p><p> Even in      always chilly Zone 3 (where frost can come in early      September and the winter temperatures sometimes drop      below-30Â°F), you can plant a second crop of      heading lettuce or endive as late as mid-July . . . and      turnips, peas, and kohlrabi can also be seeded up to the      15th of the month. Other greens-such as leaf lettuce,      spinach, and mustard-can be sown all month long.      Radishes will crop if planted in July or the first half of      August, and early turnips (such as Tokyo Cross) should      mature if they're sown before August 10th.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        GLEANINGS      </h3>      <p>        Are you nuts about nuts? Well then, by all means send an        18--stamp for the Leslie H. Wilmoth Nursery catalog        (Dept. TMEN, Route 2, Box 469, Elizabethtown, Kentucky        42701). Mr. Wilmoth features 38 black walnut cultivars        and also has a wide variety of pecans, butternuts,        hickories, Persian walnuts, and hicans (the pecan/hickory        hybrid). The nursery is sold out for this year, and        you'll have to order by October to reserve a tree for        next spring . . . . Don't forget, in the heat of the        summer, that your compost pile needs water as much as        your garden does . . . . Take geranium cuttings in        August, let the cuts callus, dip the stems in rooting        hormone, and plant them indoors for fall and winter        color.      </p>      <h3>        OFELIX SALIX      </h3>      <p>        The Avant Gardener, that gold mine of horticultural        information (it's available, at a cost of $15 for a year        of twice-monthly issues, from Horticultural Data        Processors, Dept. TMEN, Box 489, New York, New York 10028        . . . and well worth the price), recently reported on the        discovery of a potent root-promoting compound that comes        from willow tree (genus Salix) cuttings. The substance,        which is not a rooting hormone but greatly increases the        effects of such products, is said to produce dramatic        results. In one test, for instance, hard-to-start yellow        birch cuttings failed completely when rooting was        attempted with a standard 0.3% hormone treatment, but        achieved 100% success when the willow extract was added        to the hormone.      </p>      <p>        If you'd like to try the extract yourself, discoverer        Prof. Makota Kawase-of the Ohio Agricultural Research and        Development Center-suggests the following procedure: Soak        willow cuttings, in enough water to cover them, for 48        hours . . . then remove the sticks and place cuttings of        a woody species that you want to root in the "willow tea"        for 24 to 48 hours. After their soak, dip the cuttings in        0.3% hormone powder (Hormodine is one commercially        available brand) and plant the sticks in the cutting bed.        Professor Kawase also suggests soaking seeds of woody        plants in the fluid, and even watering transplants with        the liquid. Give the technique a try . . . and let MOTHER        know the results!      </p>    </div>    <p>      <strong>ZONE FOUR</strong></p><p> You      folks up in cool Zone 4,where frosts often occuraround the      first of October,can plant bush beans, Chinesecabbage,      beets, carrots, andSwiss chard through the firstweek of      July. Transplant yourfall cauliflower seedlings      beforemid-month, and sow kale andkohlrabi seeds by then,      too.You can start endive, lettuce(both heading and      leafvarieties), mustard, peas,radishes, spinach, and      turnipsalmost anytime during July.August, however, offers      lessopportunity: Spinach can besown until the 15th, and      someof the minor greens (corn saladand cress) will beat the      frosteven if planted later still.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZONE FIVE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gardeners in Zone 5 have a relatively wide range of choices      available to them. Up to mid-July, brussels sprouts and      broccoli seedlings can still be set out, as can cabbage      transplants. The 15th of July is the last day for planting      seeds of okra, rutabaga (so sweet and mellow on a winter's      evening!), summer squash, and heat-loving New Zealand      spinach. You can normally plant bush beans, beets,      cauliflower seedlings, carrots, and Swiss chard through the      third week in July . . . while Chinese cabbage, kale,      turnips, parsley (mulch it well and it'll even winter      over), and kohlrabi can be started anytime this month.</p><p> Come      August, you can plant leaf lettuce, endive, and mustard      before the 15th ... while spinach, radishes, and turnips      can probably be put in all month long. Early in August,      tip-prune your melons and winter squash. All the energy      that would have gone into setting flowers will be thrown      into ripening the fruit that's already on the vine.</p><p>      <strong>ZONE SIX</strong><br />      <br />      Since the first frost in Zone 6 occurs about October 20,      you folks can still do a good deal of planting. During the      first two weeks of July, for example, it's safe to sow bush      beans, corn, cukes, melons, summer squash,.and rutabaga.      Pepper transplants (especially varieties-like Canape      and New Ace-that set fruit well in cooler weather)      can also be set out till midJuly, as can ,potatoes. Plant      brussels sprouts seedlings, beets, broccoli transplants,      Chinese cabbage, carrots, cauliflower (transplants, of      course), Swiss chard, collards, kale, kohlrabi, leaf      lettuce, New Zealand spinach, and turnips <em>anytime</em>      in the month of July.</p><p> Zone 6 gardeners can keep busy in      August, too. Until the end of the second week, Chinese      cabbage, kale, kohlrabi, parsley, and turnips can be sown.      Many salad makings (lettuce, endive, mustard, and radishes)      can be planted all month, while the fall spinach crop      should probably go in around the 15th. And don't forget to      sow a cover crop of winter rye in any area of the garden      that's finished producing vegetables.</p><p>      <strong>ZONE SEVEN</strong><br />      <br />      If you live in temperate Zone 7, you can choose among a      <em>wide</em> variety of succession crops. With the first      frost due around November 1, there's time for many foods to      reach maturity. You can still plant limas or bush beans,      broccoli or brussels sprouts transplants, carrots, Swiss      chard. chicory, early corn, cucumbers, black-eyed peas, New      Zealand spinach, and summer squash anytime in July. During      the <em>first</em> half of the month, sow melons, soybeans,      and winter squash . . . and transplant peppers.</p><p> Then, from      July 15 to midAugust, you can set out cauliflower seedlings      and plant potatoes . . . and during all of August you can      sow Chinese cabbage, beets, Swiss chard, kale, kohlrabi      (generally the Purple Vienna variety-or the Grand      Duke hybrid-will be best for fall), lettuce, parsley,      peas, and turnips. Mustard and radishes will get a good      start in the cooler weather of late August.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZONE EIGHT</strong>    </p>    <p>      In southerly Zone 8 (where frost often arrives in      midNovember), July is too blamed hot to plant <em>some</em>      vegetables . . . but heat-loving lima and bush beans, corn,      cukes, black-eyed peas, pepper seedlings, and soybeans will      flourish if planted at any time of the month. You lucky      folks can set out tomato and eggplant seedlings until      midJuly, and plant seeds of winter squash during the same      period. The second half of the month provides prime      opportunities to make fallripening plantings of      watermelons, muskmelons, and rutabagas.</p><p> August, being a      little cooler, is actually a better month for succession      planting in Zone 8 than is July, and is a good time to sow      bush beans, beets, broccoli, brus-sets sprouts, carrots,      Swiss chard, endive, garlic (to be harvested <em>next</em>      year), kale, and shallots (they'll winter over, too). You      can also set out cauliflower transplants and start more      potatoes. Things should cool down enough by the 15th to let      you safely sow Chinese cabbage, collards, kohlrabi,      lettuce, mustard, and tangy sorrel.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZONE NINE</strong>    </p>    <p>      In the balmy reaches of Zone 9, where frost holds off until      December, both July and August are ideal months for      transplanting eggplant, peppers, and tomatoes ... and July      is a good time to sow Swiss chard, cukes, okra (mmm ...      gumbo!), black-eyed peas, soybeans, and summer squash.      Winter squash can be planted between mid-July and midAugust      ... while limas, bush beans, broccoli, brussels sprouts,      and potatoes can be sown at any time in August.</p><p>      <strong>ZONE TEN</strong></p><p>      Folks in the heart of the sunbelt-Zone 10, where      frost doesn't arrive till midDecember (if it comes at      all!)-can transplant peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes      in July and August. Both months are fine for putting in      Swiss chard, black-eyed peas, and summer squash, too . . .      but longseason soybeans should be planted in July. And      August is best for sowing brussels sprouts, potatoes,      broccoli, and okra.</p><p> Finally, southern gardeners should know      about a beautiful new book by Richard Ray and Lance Walheim      . . . <em>Citrus: How to Select, Grow and Enjoy.</em> The      fine large-format paperback is crammed with magnificent      color photographs and detailed growing advice on over 100      varieties of familiar and <em>un</em> familiar-citrus      fruits . . . including some (like the pummelo, calamondin,      and citrangequat) that <em>most</em> folks have never heard      of!
