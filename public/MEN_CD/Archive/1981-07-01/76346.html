            		        <p>      <strong>FAIR WARNING</strong> . . . In 1950, the U.S.      population used 30 billion gallons of ground water daily.      Now the figure has increased to 100 billion gallons a day      .... Last fall-for the first time ever-690,000      residents of Tidewater Virginia were subject to water      rationing because the region had received only half of its      average rainfall .... It requires an estimated 50,000      pounds of water to produce one pound of beef .... The      Tennessee Valley Authority termed the prospects for      bringing its reservoirs to full capacity this summer      "extremely poor" unless there is a dramatic change in the      weather patterns that have prevailed since June of 1980.    </p>    <p>      <strong>..</strong> <strong>. AND THEN SOME!</strong>      Arable farm soil in the U.S. is currently being paved over      at the rate of one-half square mile per hour .... About 225      million acres of American land-making up an area      roughly the size of the original 13 colonies-are      undergoing severe desertification .... Nearly 4.2 million      acres of wheat, cotton, and summer fallow lands were      damaged during the 1980-81 wind season (to put it      graphically, two bushels of farm soil are blown or washed      away for every bushel of corn grown in Iowa) .... Between      five and seven million hectares of agricultural land      worldwide are being completely lost to production, through      soil deterioration, every year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EAT YOUR FIREWOOD:</strong> Scientists say that      products of the "shmoo tree" (named after Al Capp's      amorphous cartoon characters) can be used as cocktail      snacks, fertilizer, timber for building, coffee      substitutes, flour surrogates, candy, and cattle forage.      The fast-growing relative of the mimosa-it's commonly      called the leucaena, leadtree, or jumbie beanwill flourish      on marginal land, as well!    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOPE FOR HERPES:</strong> A protein found in      pokeweed-a plant that grows wild throughout the      southeastern U.S.may be a cure for herpes. Texas      researchers report that the plant extract inhibits the      growth of herpes viruses, yet is not toxic to surrounding      cell tissue.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EARTHSHAKING FACTS:</strong> The number of      significant earthquakes-that is, those that      registered 6.5 or above on the Richter Scale-increased to      71 during 1980 (1979's total was 56). Of the 11 quakes that      occurred in the U.S. during that spell, seven hit      California.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUBTERRANEAN SURVIVAL:</strong> The first      underground condominiums-266 windowless residences      buried beneath 8 inches of reinforced concrete and 3-1/2      feet of earth-have gone on the market in La Verkin,      Utah. The survival condos range in price from $39,000 to      $78,000 . . . and the dwellings "extra" features include a      four-year supply of dried food per home, air and water      filtration systems, water storage facilities, and emergency      generators. <strong>PASSIVE SMOKING DANGER:</strong> A      15-year Japanese study has concluded that the spouses of      heavy smokers (defined as people who smoke a pack a day)      are more than twice as likely to develop lung cancer-even      though they themselves do not use tobacco-as are nonsmoking      partners of nonsmokers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE RADIOACTIVE FLUSH:</strong> The Nuclear      Regulatory Commission has proposed new standards that would      permit a wide variety of garbage containing "small" amounts      of radioactive material to be burned, placed in landfills      or dumps, flushed down toilets, or-in the case of      metals-sold as scrap!    </p>    <p>      <strong>RARE EARTH:</strong> MOM's staffers have discovered      the ultimate wish book: Rare Earth Report, a publication      featuring exotic real estate properties around the world .      . . some of which cost less than $20,000! One-year,      six-issue subscriptions are available-at      $36-from Rare Earth Report, Dept. TMEN, Box 946-REL,      Sausalito, California 94966.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AS SAFE AS MOTHER'S MILK:</strong>      PCB's-extremely stable, carcinogenic      chemicals-have been found in every sample of breast      milk taken from 1,000 nursing mothers in Michigan. Health      officials say that the amounts ranged from a trace to 5      parts per million, with the average being 1.5 PPM.      Ironically, if cow's milk contained a level of PCB's as      high as 1.5 PPM, it could not be sold!    </p>    <p>      Secretary of the Interior James Watt has stopped all      further expenditures to acquire land to protect the      <strong>APPA</strong> <strong>LACHIAN TRAIL</strong> ,      bringing to a halt negotiations that would have provided      critical links in the wilderness path way .... Experts now      believe that hyperkinesis-a disruptive behavior      disorder once believed to be largely con fined to      children-probably afflicts about <strong>ONE IN EVERY 20      ADULTS</strong> .... The Consumer Product Safety Com      mission recorded ten <strong>HOT TUB DROWNINGS</strong> in      1979, and attributed the deaths to excessively high water      tem peratures. Three of the accidents were linked with      alcohol consumption .... Although all of the rivers in the      Brazilian state of Sao Paulo have been declared      biologically dead, the nation's president has postponed the      en forcement of a law <strong>BANNING THE USE OF      NONBIODEGRADABLE DETERGENTS</strong> for two years .... A      Pasadena, Texas landowner and state wildlife officials are      locking horns over the fate of a pond on the Lone Star      Stater's property that is alleged to contain some      <strong>WHITE AMUR, A FISH PROHIBITED IN TEXAS</strong> .      Biologists want to de stroy the pond's inhabitants because      they fear that flood waters could carry the grass carp's      roe to a body of movin water, where the eggs could hatch      .... <strong>SNAIL DARTERS HAVE BEEN FOUND</strong> 80      miles from the contro versial Tellico Dam in Tennessee, an      area thought to be the darters' only natural habitat.      Biologists are ques tioning whether the fish have migrated      from the Tellico site or always lived at the "new" spot.    </p>
