                <p><strong>      SEASONS    </strong></p>        <p>      <strong><em>We all knew it has something to do with warm      spells; now find out the facts for sure</em></strong> .    </p>    <p>      <em>Three upcoming events in October and November are so      intriguing that I won't apologize for</em> <em>allowing      them to dominate the following paragraphs. The first is      this November's total eclipse of the Moon-an eclipse      for the entire country to finally enjoy. The others are the      annual (and ever-popular) changing of leaf color and the      somewhat confusing period known as Indian summer.</em>    </p>    <h3>      An Eclipse for All America    </h3>        <p>      How many of you witnessed the total lunar eclipse of last      December or the one last June? Unfortunately for those in      the West, the former was visible in its entirety only in      eastern parts of the United States. The June eclipse, on      the other hand, was an extremely West-oriented affair (only      Hawaii got a full serving of it). So I tell you with great      delight that on the night of November 28, 1993, the entire      United States will finally get a chance to see a      third-and probably very different looking-total      eclipse of the Moon.    </p>    <p>      I saw last December's eclipse and know that it was one of      the rare, very dark lunar eclipses that occurs after the      Earth's atmosphere is clogged with ash or sulfuric acid      haze from a major volcanic eruption. (You'll probably      remember that this was the handiwork of the June 1991 blast      of Mt. Pinatubo.) By the time the June 1993 eclipse      occurred, the Pinatubo haze had significantly abated. But      because the Moon passed more centrally through the Earth's      shadow, the eclipse was still not very light.    </p>    <p>      That's why I'm so eager to see November's eclipse; the      volcanic veil should be even further thinned, and the Moon      will be crossing closer to the southern edge of the Earth's      shadow, or "umbra:' It's more than likely the Moon will      remain easily visible; in fact, it will probably shine a      cheerful orange or pink-with perhaps a few eerie dark      patches-throughout the eclipse.    </p>    <p>      The accompanying timetable lists the times at which the      most dramatic effects of the eclipse can be seen. The light      shading of the "penumbra," or peripheral shadow of the      Earth, is usually not detectable until it's about halfway      across the Moon's face. Every total eclipse of the Moon is      unique, so this is one event you shouldn't miss. Hopefully,      skies won't be so overcast where you live that they hide      the Moon on the big night. Unfortunately, if you miss this      one, you're out of luck-no total lunar eclipse will      be visible from anywhere in the world again until April 4,      1996, when only the eastern United States will get a look.    </p>    <p>      Other interesting astronomical events in November include      the striking gatherings of the planets, Moon, and stars      (see the "Sky Calendar" on page 18 and the Almanac on      BELOW). November's partial solar eclipse is only visible in      the extremely southern part of the Earth. But on November      6, Hawaiian readers will get a chance to behold the rare      sight of Mercury passing across the face of the      Sun-as long as they're careful to observe the Sun      safely. (Refer to a journal, such as November's <em>Sky      & Telescope,</em> for viewing directions.)    </p>    			<h3>      Flame of Foliage Color    </h3>    <p>      Returning our gaze back to Earth, we find October colors      that even the most brilliantly hued lunar eclipse can't      match (although I did see purple briefly in last December's      eclipse). "October is the month for painted leaves," says      Thoreau in his little-read essay "Autumnal Tints" (which I      highly recommend). Of course, you'll find that even the      great Thoreau cannot capture all of the complexity,      majesty, and heart-piercing poignancy of fall foliage.    </p>    <p>      I'll be brief and only mention a few observations about      autumn's leaf-color changes. One little-known fact is that      all of the vivid hues of these leaves-the reds,      oranges, yellows, and purples-are actually present in      leaves year-round. But it is only in autumn that the leaves      lose chloro phyll, the chemical that produces the dominant      green color, permitting the hidden hues to be revealed.      Also interesting is how factors such as tree age, location      in direct sunlight, and anything else you can think of,      decide which trees (or parts of a tree) start changing      color first. I'd be glad to hear from any reader who has      comments about this, lunar eclipses, or any other subject      in this column.

But, as weather-watcher and New England folklorist      Eric Sloane once declared, "...no one is completely certain      as to its exact date, its origin, or even what the term      implies:'    </p>    <p>      Many authorities believe Indian summer is the first spell      of decidedly warm, calm weather after the year's first      frost. If we accept this definition, of course, Indian      summer falls on different dates at different places and in      different years, making it really hard to keep track of.      But there have also been attempts to identify this "second      summer" or "fifth season" with one of two periods that are      reputed to have this kind of weather every year on the same      dates.    </p>    <p>      In Europe, for example, there are two versions of Indian      summer: "St. Luke's Little Summer" and "St. Martin's      Summer." The former runs from St. Luke's Day on October 18      through October 28. (St. Luke is the author of one of the      Bible's four Gospels about Christ's life.) The latter runs      from St. Martin's Day (Martinmas) on November 11 through      November 20. St. Martin was an early bishop who died in      A.D. 397. This active missionary in Gaul gained a      reputation as one of the greatest wonder workers in his      time. In the United States, of course, Martinmas is      overshadowed by Veteran's Day, the day on which World War I      ended.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PROPER CREDIT: We have President Abraham Lincoln to      thank for our annual turkey feasts.</strong>    </p>					<p>      A less famous period-invoked presumably when the      appropriate weather occurred between St. Luke's and St.      Martin's summers-is Allhallown Summer, named for All      Hallows' Day on November 1.    </p>    <p>      But now comes the most delightful complication of all. St.      Martin's summer was once known as "goose summer," probably      because, in parts of Europe, November is regarded as the      time when geese are in season. For instance, in German,      November (spelled the same as in English) means "geese      month." But the term "goose summer" gave rise to a word      that describes the delicate strands of spider web that are      common in many lands during spells of warm, calm weather in      autumn: gossamer. (The transition from goose summer to      gossamer may have even included a stage in which there was      a "gauze summer.") I first learned of the connection      between gossamer and Indian summer, and about the aerial      feats of tiny spiders, in Eric Sloane's <em>Look at the      Sky</em> (Hawthorn Books Inc., 1970). You can read about      other interesting twists in the etymology of gossamer in      the <em>Oxford English Dictionary.</em>    </p>			<p>      But what about the origin of the term "Indian summer"      itself? One leading theory holds that the periods of warm,      still weather in autumn were the times when Native      Americans began their fall hunting trips. Another theory      claims that the haze characteristic of these periods was at      first thought to be caused by, or at least to resemble, the      smoke from Native American campfires in the hills.    </p>    <p>      Although many parts of the United States have spells of      such weather, the most common and exemplary episodes of      Indian summer occur in the region where the term first      appeared, in records written during the Revolutionary War:      the Mid-Atlantic states and the Ohio Valley. Indian summer      in this region is generally caused by high-pressure systems      that frequently stall near West Virginia at this time of      year.    </p>    <p>      By the way, some authorities maintain that Indian summer      occurs not after the first frost but after the first      freeze-and that the intermediary spell of freezing      weather is known as "squaw winter."    </p>    <h3>      Happy Thanksgiving    </h3>    <p>      We are often reminded that the American holiday of      Thanksgiving got its start with the Pilgrims and Native      Americans in 1621. But few people know that we probably      never would have had this holiday were it not for Abraham      Lincoln, the Civil War, and a woman named Sarah Josepha      Hale.    </p>    <p>      There was no regular yearly celebration of Thanksgiving for      almost 250 years after the Pilgrim's first feast (despite      what you may have learned in second grade). It was Sarah      Josepha Hale who, from 1821 until 1863 (42 years!), wrote      editorials in women's magazines arguing for a national      celebration of Thanksgiving on a single day each year. Her      editorial in September 1863, published in the midst of the      Civil War, sparked the interest of Abraham Lincoln, who      thought it was an excellent idea that would bring together      the divided country. On October 3, 1863, Lincoln decreed      that the last Thursday in each November should be a      national Thanksgiving Day. So, before you take that first      bite of fresh turkey this Thanksgiving, take a second to      give thanks to these two.    </p>
