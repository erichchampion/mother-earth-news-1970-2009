                <p><strong>      HERBALIST'S NOTEBOOK    </strong></p>    		<p><strong><em>Drink away common ailments and frayed nerves    with herb teas.</em></strong></p>    <h5 id="byline">      <em>By Carol Pearson</em>    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Drinking a cup of hot sassafras tea after a long      week of work will help perk you for the weekend.</strong>    </p>        <p>      Ever wish you could drink a cup of magic potion to      alleviate that headache or soothe those nerves after a      long, exhausting day? Herb teas, called tisanes, may be as      near a potion as you'll ever find, offering an incredibly      wide variety of flavors and medicinal uses.    </p>    <p>      Old-fashioned horehound tea, for example, is considered      good for colds and sore throats. Elder tea, which smells      and tastes like lilacs, can be helpful to asthmatics and      those with skin trouble. Spicy sassafras tea makes an      excellent spring tonic. If your main interest is getting      hooked on a delicious herb tea-as opposed to a      caffeine-plagued coffee or tannic-acid-filled tea-you      can try an assortment of teas, from lemon to licorice to      apple. Serve them steaming hot in fall or winter, or      refreshingly iced in summer-and sweeten with honey if      desired.    </p>    <p>      To introduce yourself to herb teas, purchase a      quarter-ounce of several different types of tea herbs. If      you purchase them at an herb shop or farmers' market, make      sure each package of herbs is labeled or otherwise marked      so you'll know what it is when you get home. Most herb teas      come in tea bags as well. <em>Note:</em> Use equal parts of      caution and common sense when consuming herbs as you would      with any type of medication. In the beginning, don't overdo      the strength of your beverage mixture or the amount you      drink.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Preparation</strong>    </p>    <p>      To use loose herbs, you'll need a tea bob or strainer and a      glass or porcelain container with a tight-fitting lid. Add      one teaspoon of the herb or herb mixture to one cup of      boiling water and steep in container for five minutes.      (Amount of tea and steeping time can be adjusted to taste.)      If making only one cup, cover with a saucer while brewing.      Metal teapots without linings, such as those made from      aluminum, are not suitable because traces of the metal can      contaminate the herbs.    </p>    <p>      For iced tea, add four to eight teaspoons of herbs      (according to taste) to a quart of boiling water. Steep for      approximately five minutes, let cool, and serve over ice.      If you like a richer, stronger taste throughout the course      of your drink, make and freeze some herbal tea in icecube      trays ahead of time to add to your glass.    </p>    <p>      Another refreshing option is sun tea: Add four to eight      teaspoons of herbs to a quart or so of cold water in a      clear glass container and place in the sun for two to six      hours. Chill and serve over ice.    </p>    <p>      Infusions are made only from the leaves and flowers of      herbs, which release their volatile oils when steeped in a      teapot of boiling-hot water. (If the herbs are simply      boiled, the oil evaporates.) Crush one teaspoon of dried      herbs for every cup of wa ter and put into teapot with an      extra teaspoon added for good measure. (You can also use a      handful of fresh herbs.) Pour boiling water over the herbs      and let stand five to 15 minutes until it reaches the      desired strength.    </p>    <p>      All seeds and roots, and the leaves of a few herbs such as      horehound, lemon balm, and bee balm, must be boiled to      extract their volatile oils. To make a decoction, first      crush the roots or seeds, allowing one teaspoonful for each      cup of water and one for the pot. Boil the herbs for 15 to      20 minutes in a glass or porcelain container. Seeds, roots,      and bark such as sassafras may also be percolated like      coffee. Decoctions are often used in preparing medicinal      herbs.    </p>    <p>      For a real hot blast, heat your teapot before adding      boiling water for an infusion or pouring in a decoction. Or      do as the English do: knit or sew a "tea cozy" to cover and      insulate your teapot.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Garland of Teas</strong>    </p>    <p>      ALFALFA: The seeds and leaves of this valuable herb are      packed full of vitamins A, D, E, and K. Alfalfa is also      considered to be one of the best sources of essential      minerals.    </p>    <p>      It also contains eight known enzymes and makes a mild,      grassy tisane that can be flavored with mint. ANGELICA:      Known in the past as the "root of the Holy Ghost," this      heavenly aromatic variety reputedly sweetens the digestive      tract and strengthens the heart, cure the top plate and      roof to the footings. Then cover all of the straw walls      with netting or 1" chicken wire before adding the finish of      cement plaster and stucco.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Step 6.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before you build your own plastered straw-bale house, talk      to someone who has already gone through the process. The      next best thing is to start with a step-by-step guidebook,      such as <em>A Straw Bale Primer,</em> available from its      author, S.O. MacDonald, for $10. Write to MacDonald at P.O.      Box 58, Gila, NM 88038.    </p>    <p>      Construction details that include drawings and specific      answers to construction questions are also available from      consultants Matts Myhrman and Judy Knox of Out on Bale      Unlimited (602/624-1673).    </p>    <p>      One especially useful booklet available from them is      "First-Aid Kit for Plastered Straw-Bale Construction,"      which shares the lessons they have learned by building      straw-bale homes.    </p>    <p>      Another good manual that contains construction details is      <em>Plastered Straw Bale Construction,</em> by David      Bainbridge with Athena and Bill Steen, which is available      for $12 from The Canelo Project, HCR Box 324, Canelo, AZ      85611 (602/455-5548). This manual contains an extensive      bibliography on the technology of strawbale construction.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Additional Sources of Information</strong>    </p>    <p>      To order <em>The Last Straw,</em> contact Judy Knox at Out      on Bale Unlimited, 1037 East Linden Street, Tucson, AZ      85719.    </p>    <p>      Carol Escott of Sustainable Systems Support has put out a      video entitled "Straw-Bale Construction: The Elegant      Solution" for $33 (including shipping and handling). Write      her at P.O. Box 318, Bisbee, AZ 85603.    </p>    <p>      The Straw Bale Test Fund, under the Community Information      Resource Center, C.I.R.C., will administer the test ing      program and funds. Tax deductible contributions to this      fund can be sent to P .O. Box 42663, Tucson, AZ 85733.      These contributions are applied toward purchas ing      materials for compression tests and obtaining a fire rating      for stucco-covered straw-bale walls.    </p>    <p>      One source for purchasing bamboo stakes (which can be used      to spear bales so that they stay aligned) is Hummert's Seed      Company. They sell bundles of 200 sixfoot rods. You can      write them at 2746 Chouteau, St. Louis, MO 63103, or call      800/325-3055.    </p>
