                <p><strong>      PET HEALTH</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em><strong>With equal training, veterinarians charge a      fraction of human doctor fees. They simply love animals.</strong>			</em>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">			<em>By      Andrea Looney, D.V.M.</em>    </h5>        <p>      I was on emergency duty recently and responded to a client      who came running through our doors, bathed in tears and      desperately clutching her 14-year-old hyperthyroid cat in a      red tow el. Boo-Boo, a gentle yet antiquated calico, had      somehow struggled up underneath the hood of the neighbor's      car, strad dled the fan belt, and nearly met her death the      next morning when the engine turned over.    </p>    <p>      The owner, Ms. X, was frantic, and with good reason.      Boo-Boo was a disaster. In shock and dehydrated, she had a      severe heart murmur-worsened by her hyperthyroid      condition and two large gashes on her hind legs and chest      from the nasty fan belt. The night was already late. The      financial situation of the owner was grim at best. I      couldn't help but wonder why only my emergency nights      seemed plagued by "full-moon" near-fatalities such as this      one.    </p>    <p>      I sent Ms. X home with the notion that somehow we'd devise      a payment plan if and when the little cat made it through      the night. She unwillingly left, still crying, clutching      her purse, and mumbling to herself something about nine      lives.    </p>    <p>      I wandered back to the intensive-care unit to commence the      massive cleanup effort of Boo-Boo's wounds, started her on      intravenous-fluid therapy, and stabilized her heart      condition. It wasn't until 1 A.M. that the last of 47      sutures was placed in her legs, the anesthesia was turned      off, and I left to get a few hours of sleep.    </p>    <p>      At 7 A.M. the next morning, much to everyone's      satisfaction, Boo-Boo was bright and alert, though still a      bit shocked and pained. She had made it through the worst      part of the trauma.    </p>    <p>      Over the next three days, her condition improved enough so      that she was able to return home under strict house      confinement, medication, and tender loving care. Her owner      was ecstatic, and I ended up waiving the emergency fee and      surgery cost, charging only for hospital boarding. I'm not      sure if this was due to the good Samaritan in me or the      fact that I had forgotten to log the fees in the computer      due to late-night drowsiness. Either way, it was one more      happy ending.    </p>    <p>      But the experience left me thinking. Too many pet owners      I've spoken with believe that veterinarians enjoy sinking      their hooks into patients. They are convinced that      veterinarians force them into unnecessary payment traps or      perform emergency care just to bring in extra income. I      tell the Boo-Boo story simply to convey the thought that      veterinary medicine is probably one of the biggest bargains      you can obtain these days. I come to believe this more and      more as I progress in my career, and hope it's a thought      you can also share, albeit under different circumstances      than a late-night fan-belt mishap.    </p>    <p>      Anyway, I'll stop lecturing and wish you all a Happy      Thanksgiving. If you have any questions about the dog who      got into too many turkey table scraps after the great      dinner, or the cat who ate someone's Halloween candy, I'd      be happy to answer them. In the meantime, do me a small      favor: Keep your car hoods closed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea,</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We purchased a five-month-old bulldog recently and      are interested in having her spayed. My husband believes      that it's wrong to deprive an animal of the natural right      to reproduce and that spaying will change our pup's      personality. Can you give us some insight on these      questions?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Evelyn Petersen<br /></em> <em>Topeka,      Kansas</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Evelyn,    </p>    <p>      There seem to be many old wives' tales about whether to let      a pet breed or not.    </p>    <p>      Many of these myths seem to be surrounded by our ability to      anthropomorphize our pets; in other words, why would we      want to deprive our pup of the chance to bear offspring      when we wouldn't do that to ourselves? Actually, though,      when you consider the medical and behavioral      advantages-as well as the social and humane issues      involved-spaying and neutering may be one of the      kindest things we can do.    </p>        <p>      By spaying a female animal (removing her reproductive      tract), we do deprive her of the ability to bear young. But      unlike humans, most of an animal's sense to mate and breed      is initiated by internal or physiological mechanisms and      has very little to do with matters of the heart. To carry      this even further, consider the actions of planned breeding      and artificial insemination. Using these techniques,      owners, breeders, and animal-show workers breed animals in      an attempt to optimize certain qualities of specific      breeds, often for their own purposes and sometimes with      severe medical consequences.    </p>    <p>      As for changing your pet's personality, your husband is      probably correct in thinking this will happen. But it's      often in your favor. Without the necessary organs to      reproduce, animals usually don't produce those key      hormones-estrogen and testosterone-that      initiate mating behavior in the adult pet.    </p>    <p>      We're all aware of the events that surround "in-season"      times: roaming, fighting for mates, aggressivity,      personality changes, etc. Chances are, you will benefit      from any psychological or social changes that might result      from the surgery, because your pet will probably not engage      in roaming (possibly into someone else's territory or worse      yet, traffic) or fighting over po tential mates. She is      also likely to have a more stable temperament.    </p>    <p>      The surgical procedure referred to as spaying ("neutering"      is usually reserved for male animals) is medically termed      an ovariohysterectomy. The animal is anesthetized and the      ovaries, uterine horns, and uterine body of the female's      genital tract are removed under sterile conditions.    </p>    <p>      The most common reason for spaying is to eliminate the      possibilities of unwanted kittens or puppies, and to obtain      a certificate of sterilization for licensing. In addition,      by spaying before the animal's first heat (or estrus), dogs      will have 1/12 the incidence of breast cancer of those      spayed after their first heat cycle. Dogs spayed after      their first heat cycle (but usually under two to three      years of age) also have a lower incidence of mammary tumors      than those that aren't spayed at all.    </p>    <p>      So by spaying your pup, you're actual ly giving her      preventive care for her adult life. If this is done prior      to her first estrus cycle-outside of eliminating the      possibil ity of uterine infections and uterine or ovarian      cancer-you're also decreasing her chances of      developing mammary cancer.    </p>    <p>      Most vets agree it's best to neuter or spay a puppy at five      to six months of age. Current research in veterinary      anesthesia and surgery, however, is examining the      possibility that these "elective surgeries" can be      performed earlier in the animal's life (eight to 12 weeks      of age) in an effort to help control animal overpopulation      and reduce the leading cause of death in animals - euthana      sia (putting an animal to sleep).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea,</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>I own a 13-year-old dalmation,</strong>      <strong>Roscoe, who has a small tumor on</strong>      <strong>his toe. My vet</strong> <strong>sums</strong>      <strong>removing it</strong> <strong>surgically, but I am      afraid of the fate.</strong> <strong>Is it safe for      Roscoe?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>-Peter Davidson</em></strong> <em><br />      <strong>Vineland, New Jersey</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Peter,    </p>    <p>      Using anesthesia on an older dog can be challenging but is      a relatively safe procedure if necessary precautions are      taken. Any geriatric patient, canine or feline, is likely      to have more disease than a young patient, as well as less      "reserve;" or ability of the body systems to handle the      stress of disease, hospitalization, anesthesia, and      surgery.    </p>    <p>      Thus, the primary goals of treating any geriatric patient      under anesthesia are to minimize stress by keeping      anesthesia time to a minimum, using drugs that produce      minimal cardiopulmonary depression, maintaining adequate      kidney function, and monitoring constantly and closely.      Most modern veterinary hospitals are equipped with adequate      cardiac and respiratory monitoring devices to ensure that      precautions are taken and patients under anesthesia stay      within a "safe zone."    </p>    <p>      One of the best precautions you can take is to maintain a      basic wellness plan. This involves keeping Roscoe's      vaccinations up-to-date, having him undergo yearly physical      exams and parasite checks, and possibly even doing a      presurgical blood screening and complete blood-cell count.      (These are often performed annually in geriatric animals as      part of a routine health-care screen.)    </p>    <p>      SPAYING/NEUTERING: Most veterinarians agree that it's best      to spay or neuter your puppy at five to six months of age.    </p>    <p>      This would allow your vet to choose suitable anesthetic      drugs and ensure that Roscoe's liver and kidneys are      working adequately to clear them out. In addition, some      simple blood tests may flag other health      problems-including metabolic, endocrine, cardiac,      liver, and kidney troubles-that should be addressed      prior to the surgery. Some vets even suggest preanesthetic      electrocardiograms or radiographs (x-rays) to evaluate      their patients more thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Particularly important, especially for Roscoe's breed, is      an evaluation of his urinary tract (kidneys and bladder)      before surgery. Dalmations are often predisposed to urinary      calculi (stone) formation. The urinary tract is very      important in clearing any drugs, let alone anesthetic      agents, from the bloodstream, so make sure that his kidneys      are in good shape prior to surgery. Your vet might suggest      a complete urinalysis and/or ultrasound of Roscoe's      abdomen.    </p>    <p>      Local anesthesia or nerve blocks are an option to remove a      simple skin tumor from Roscoe's toe. However, if the mass      is firmly adherent to any underlying tissues (which is      usually the case), it's probably safer to reduce his stress      and pain completely with the use of general anesthesia.    </p>    <p>      In response to the increased number of animals that we      consider "geriatrics," modern veterinary medicine has      developed some of the finest techniques in anesthesia and      analgesia (pain relief) for making surgical procedures      safer. Should you take these precautions, the age of your      pets no longer becomes the determining factor for avoiding      the surgery. Consider what one of my favorite mentors has      been quoted as saying, "Age is never a disease; don't make      it one!"    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea,</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We just obtained a kitten who has a few additional      toes. Are there any problems with these? Should we consider      declawing her?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Judy Preston<br />      Orange County, CA</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Judy,    </p>        <p>      Most cats have five toes on each of their front feet and      four on each hind foot. Polydactyly-the presence of      one or more extra digits (or toes)-is commonly      present at birth in pigs and cats and is extremely common      in cats from northeastern United States and southeastern      Canada. In certain breeds of cats, a double-pawed condition      sometimes appears.    </p>    <p>      There are a few problems with extra or supernumerary toes.      Often, the toes that are duplicated are the first or      innermost toes, with respect to our thumbs. These toes,      which do not contact the ground, are known as dewclaws.      With little or no ground or surface contact, the nails tend      to overgrow; if not clipped regularly, they usually grow      into the pads or skin, causing great discomfort.    </p>    <p>      Also, these extra toes are usually extremely mobile because      they have less connective tissue attachments (bones and      ligaments) to the foot than their normal counterparts.      Therefore, they often catch on rugged surfaces, or are      pulled and torn by carpeting. Cats have less of a problem      with these extra toes than do dogs, because most cats and      kittens are more agile and have better balance.    </p>    <p>      I would not suggest declawing any cat unless it was an      alternative to euthanasia or giving it up. In fact, I      believe that if more owners knew the logistics of the      surgery, they might be more reluctant to have their pets go      through with it. Declawing is a misnomer. A more accurate      term might be "de-toeing" because the procedure actually      involves the amputation or removal of the outermost bone of      each of the toes. This is a painful procedure, as is any      amputation, and most vets who perform the surgery provide      cats with a balanced anesthesia regime that includes pain      relief or analgesia first and foremost. The surgery, if      need be performed, is best accomplished early in the      kitten's life (six to eight months of age), when the      connective tissue is more easily severed, and recovery is      often speedier. Declawing is usually performed only on      indoor or well-protected cats that have little need to      defend themselves, and it is normally necessary to declaw      only the front feet.    </p>    <p>      Many people declaw cats to prevent damage to furniture and      injury to owners, but there are alternatives: behavior      modification (training the cat not to scratch), capping the      nails with synthetic covers, or even alternate surgical      procedures that sever the tendons involved in flexing the      toes (which some believe is less drastic).    </p>    <p>      <em>Editor's Note: Send your questions to Dr. Looney c/o:      Country Pets,</em> <em>M OTHER E ARTH</em> <em>N EWS , P.O.
