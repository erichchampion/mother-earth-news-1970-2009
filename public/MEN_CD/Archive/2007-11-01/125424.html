        <p>Few of us make it through the winter without a scratchy throat,a runny nose or worse. You can't very well hold your breath allwinter, but you can put your immune system in top-notch form tofight colds and flu by employing these natural methods for easingsymptoms and hastening recovery:</p><br /><p><strong>Vitamin C.</strong> While study results vary on usingvitamin C to prevent colds, some vitamin C users do report areduced duration and severity of cold symptoms, indicating that itmay play some role in respiratory defense mechanisms. Eatingvitamin C-rich foods, such as peppers, guava, citrus fruits,strawberries and leafy greens, is always a great idea.</p><br /><p><strong>Zinc.</strong> There have been about a dozen studies onzinc lozenges and nasal gels, with mixed results. In a recentEuropean study, children received zinc sulphate (15 milligrams ofzinc) as a syrup for seven months, with a doubling of the dose atthe onset of cold symptoms. Compared to kids who took a placebosyrup, those taking zinc had significantly fewer colds, and thecolds they got were shorter and milder. Side effects with the zinclozenges include nausea and weird taste. And there have beenreports of people permanently losing their sense of smell afterusing the nasal gels ? a good reason to choose lozengesinstead.</p><br /><p><strong>Echinacea.</strong> Two types of echinacea preparationshave repeatedly been shown effective in fighting colds and flu: thejuice of the aboveground parts of <em>E. purpurea</em> (marketed asEchinagard), and the alcoholic extracts (tinctures) of the roots of<em>E. purpurea</em> and <em>E. pallida</em>. Though study resultsare mixed, most experts say that when a good product is taken inadequate and frequent doses at the onset of symptoms, echinacea canshorten the duration and severity of a cold.</p><br /><p><strong>Elderberry.</strong> An extract of the blackelderberries (<em>Sambucus nigra</em>) produces beneficial immuneactions and helps fight influenza and other respiratory viruses.Two small studies have demonstrated rapid recovery from influenzawith a proprietary elderberry extract called Sambucol, which isavailable in many natural food stores. You also can make your ownelderberry syrup.</p><br /><p><strong>Licorice root.</strong> This tasty root has manyproperties that can relieve cold and flu symptoms. Licorice root issweet and makes most herbal blends taste great. It's ananti-inflammatory, demulcent (soothing to sore throats),antispasmodic (to relax tight coughs) and expectorant (expelsrespiratory mucus). However, don't take licorice for more than fourto six weeks ? it causes your kidneys to retain water and sodiumand lose potassium. Don't take it at all if you're pregnant, havehigh blood pressure or low blood potassium, or take a potassiumdepleting diuretic.</p><br /><p>Have you tried these or other natural remedies for colds andflu?
