                    <h5 id="byline">      by Richard Freudenberger    </h5>    <p>      Tread lightly if you don't use geometry, patience or basic      carpentry skills. By Richard Freudenberger    </p>        <p>      <strong>M</strong>AKE A POINT SOMETIME to study the stairs      in your home. Inthe light of scrutiny, that one piece of      construction can change from a taken-for-granted utility to      a display of planning and execution that's as close to      perfect as you're likely to see under a family roof.    </p>    <p>      Think of all the elements that could've gone askew: An      angle too steep or too shallow, a beam placed just where      your pate passes daily, steps that are short, narrow or      pitched one way or the other-any of these would make      a quick run upstairs seem like a dash through an obstacle      course.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, others have gone before us and charted the      way. And stairs in the great majority of houses don't      require the skills of a master builder but rather an      appreciation of planning. Once that's established, a      circular saw and a few hand tools can work wonders for the      careful soul seeking a simple stair to another story.    </p>    <h3>      Some Garden Varieties    </h3>    <p>      An <em>open</em> stairway is just what it implies: It's      exposed on one or both sides and uses a balustrade if there      are more than two or three steps. <em>Closed</em> stairways      are flanked by full or knee walls and use handrails rather      than the post-and-banister railing of the open style.      Stairs with no backboards, or risers, are called <em>open      tread</em> stairways and may or may not be exposed.    </p>    <p>      For a stair builder, there are further distinctions based      on how the treads and risers are fastened to the stair      carriages, or <em>stringers.</em>    </p>    <p>      But the most manageable design uses a cutout, or notched,      stringer. The seats for the treads are cut directly into      the 2 X 12 carriage planks, making an exaggerated sawtooth      pattern in the upper edge. The assembly can be exposed, as      in a basement stair, or dressed up with      <em>skirtboards</em> -side trim that is fitted to the      treads and risers to give a finished look to the structure      beneath. It's a good stair for the first-time builder to      tackle.    </p>            <h3>      The Flight Plan    </h3>    <p>      The few rules that exist in stair building are based upon a      combination of common sense and code compliance. For      example, main stairways usually must be 36" wide from wall      to wall, but a 42" width is more comfortable. Likewise,      minimum headroom-the distance from the nose of the      tread to any overhead member-is established at 80", but      many house stairs are more generous by 6" or so-and      basement steps are shy that by a couple of inches.    </p>    <p>      The open side of any stairway higher than 30" should have a      railing fixed at 30" to 34" above the tread nosing; closed      stairways require a handrail on one side (or both, if the      steps are wider than 44").    </p>    <p>      Carriage stringers are nearly always made from 2 X 12s,      since their depth allows for the minimum 3 1/2" of wood      between the plank's lower edge and the cuts. Stairs with      two-by or thicker treads-deck steps or rustic      interior designs-have stringers spaced 3' apart. A finished      stair with thinner tread stock needs a stringer every 30".      Of course, a center member can be added to any stairway to      improve stability.    </p>    <p>      Since we're creatures of habit, we tend to develop certain      expectations, and one of them is that a flight of stairs      will feel "right" underfoot. Building codes set guidelines:      a tread width no less than 9" and a riser height no more      than 8'/a". Within those limits, there's enough flexibility      to work up a stairway that's comfortable-in both step and      angle-and which will fit in any reasonable space between      floor levels.    </p>    <p>      One well-known method of arriving at the best tread and      riser combination is to add the two together: The total      should equal 17 1/2", give or take a fraction. So, a 71/4"      riser and a 10 1/4" tread is just about right. (The 1" to 1      1/4" nosing isn't included in the calculations.) The angle      of incline is a little more subjective, though somewhere      between 32° and 37° is considered      ideal-slightly more than exterior stairs, but not as      steep as the 50° stairways in some older homes.    </p>    <p>      Meeting the headroom requirements demands a sharp eye      toward several points mentioned earlier. Increasing the      risers (and narrowing the tread, front to back) will do the      trick, but you'll pay the price in a steeper stairway.    </p>    <p>      Enlarging the stair opening at the top may be a better      choice; a 3' X 10' framed well can be lengthened a bit to      gain "altitude" over those lower steps. Framing most stair      openings amounts to simply doubling the headers and trimmer      (side) joists-but stair wells built away from      load-bearing walls need support from below unless the      overhead joists are properly designed.    </p>        <h3>      Go Figure    </h3>        <p>      Now you can get down to cases. After you've established the      height between <em>finished</em> floors and checked for      levelness of the upper and lower surfaces, grab a      calculator, and prepare to plug in some trial numbers.      Let's say you have a 7 1/2' ceiling, and your working      height is 102". Divide that by 15, a common number of      risers for a house stair. The result-6.8" per      riser-is a bit low; reducing the plan by one riser, to 14,      will give you a riser height of 7.28", just about perfect.      Then, using the old 17 1/2" rule of thumb referred to      earlier, subtract 7.28 from 17.5 to get the width of each      tread: 10.22, or comfortably close to 10 1/4".    </p>    <p>      Next, you'll be calculating the total run-the      horizontal length of the stairway from bottom riser to top,      where the header will form the last riser. (This isn't true      of a stair that ends in a full or partial tread, but that      doesn't affect the formula, since that surface is still      part of the carriage.) Mind you, this is not the diagonal      measurement, but the length of space that will ultimately      be taken up on the floor below.    </p>    <p>      To get that figure, multiply the number of treads (13) by      each one's width (10.22") to arrive at 132.86", or just a      saw blade's width over 11' . But how did we know the number      of treads? Easy: There's always one less tread than there      are risers in any stair, simply because the floor surfaces      serve as treads without being part of the stairway.    </p>    <p>      Armed with this information, you can quickly determine      whether your flight plan will fit in the space intended. If      you're shy of room at the foot of the stairs, it's not the      end of the world. Narrow the treads a bit, or remove one      tread and riser, and live with a steeper stair.    </p>    <p>      Finally, you'll need to calculate the length of the      stringers. They're really just the third leg of a triangle,      so simple geometry (a 2 + b 2 = c 2 ) will give you that      figure-167.5". However, because to mark accurately      you'll need to know where the "missing" floor tread would      end, you'll have to add the width of a tread to get a      working figure, 177.72". That's 14' 9 3/4'; so 16' planks      would allow plenty of room for trimming and for planning      around knotholes.    </p>    <h3>      Square the Corners    </h3>    <p>      At this point, the theory becomes fact. You're ready to      transfer the numbers to the stringer planks and make the      cuts that will establish your stairs. To do it right,      you'll need a 16' wide-blade tape measure, and a 2' framing      square with screw-on stair gauges-small knobs that      fix to the edge of the tool.    </p>    <p>      First, mark the edge of one stringer to the length you      calculated. Then pinpoint the tread width and the riser      height on your square, and clamp the stair gauges to the      outside of the square blades at those points.    </p>    <p>      Starting at one end of the stringer, hold the gauges      against the edge of the board, and strike the tread and      riser cut lines along the blade edges, beginning each      successive combination at the end of the previous one.      Don't make the mistake of reversing your dimensions, or      you'll end up with narrow treads that are pitched forward      drastically.    </p>    <p>      Before doing any cutting, you'll have to take into account      the thickness of the tread material and its relation to      that of the finish flooring. This process, known as      "dropping the stringers," insures that all the finished      riser heights will be the same when the stair's installed,      and amounts to nothing more than trimming the base of the      stringer boards.    </p>    <p>      An easy way to calculate that cut is to subtract the      thickness of the finish floor material from the actual      tread thickness. The result is the amount you'll need to      trim from the bottom. If the stairway rests on a finished      slab, that dimension will equal the thickness of a tread.    </p>    <p>      Use a circular saw to make the end cuts and nearly the full      length of each tread and riser cut. You'll have to use a      handsaw to complete the inside corners because the      curvature of the circular blade doesn't produce a square      cut. If you're unsure of your arithmetic, you can always      complete just the base and header cuts, then fit the      stringer temporarily into position to check things. Done      correctly, the stringer will meet the floor and header      flush at both ends, and all the tread lines will be level.      Once that's the case, use the finished cutout stringer as a      template for any others you'll be making.    </p>        <h3>      Step It Up and Go    </h3>    <p>      The stair carriages must be fastened securely at the top      and bottom, both for safety and to minimize the creaking      that will tend to develop over the years. At the top of the      stairs, it's easy to let the header be the first riser. In      this case, the carriage can be secured to a full-length      hanger board equal to the depth of the stringer and the      height of the riser. The board is then nailed to the      header. Preformed steel hangers can also be used.    </p>    <p>      If a full or partial tread meets the finished floor, the      stringers can be nailed right to the header; an even better      setup is to notch the lower corners at the top of the      carriage and install a stair-width 2 X 4 ledger to help      support the assembly from below.    </p>    <p>      Attaching the base is even easier. It can be nailed      directly to the subfloor or cut to fit against a landing      frame, then secured. On a slab or wooden floor, a      pressure-treated 2 X 4 plate bolted or nailed to the      surface and set behind the bottom riser can serve as a      stop, much like the ledger board above.    </p>    <p>      Before actually nailing the stringers in place, you'll need      to decide if the carriages will remain exposed or be      trimmed with a skirting. Structurally, there's little      difference, but in a finished stair one or both of the      outside stringers may be set in 3" or more. The newel post      can then be fastened to the stringer, and the lowest tread      and its adjacent skirt cut to fit around the post so it's      flush with the skirtboards.    </p>    <p>      Of course, you may want the post at the end or the outside      of the staircase; if that's so, the stringer can be shifted      outward.    </p>    <p>      Installing the treads and risers can range from a      cut-and-nail assembly job to a tedious fitting process. In      the simplest case, an exposed stairway has 1 X 8 risers      ripped to the appropriate width and cut to meet the outside      edges of the carriage. The treads are cut to leave the 1"      or so nosing at the front when the backs are butted against      the already-installed risers, and a slight overhang is      included at the sides.    </p>    <p>      Far more labor-intensive is a stair built against a wall,      buf finished with skirt trim. Here, before the stringers      are placed, a 1 X 10 skirtboard is nailed to the wall,      parallel with the line of the tread nosing. The open      skirtboard is cut out in the pattern of a stringer, with      the exception that the vertical edges which meet the risers      must extend far enough forward to accept a 45° miter (a      table or radial-arm saw would help here). The skirt is then      finish-nailed to the outside stringer on 1 X 4 blocking.    </p>    <p>      Each tread and riser is cut to the right width as before.      Then the risers are mitered to match the skirting, and the      opposite ends individually cut and fastened as you work      your way up the stair. The treads are cut to overhang the      open side, to match the nosing. Each square edge can then      be rounded with a rasp and sander, or the front corner can      be mitered and the edge trimmed to accept a piece of      rounded nosing trim. A molding is usually used beneath the      tread to cover the joints where the riser and skirt meet      it.    </p>    <p>      Use 8d finishing nails to secure both the treads and risers      to the stringers (screws can also be used, especially if      the tread material is thick). If you have hardwood treads,      predrill the holes before sinking the nails. It's      important, too, to make sure the inside joint between tread      and riser stays intact; a few 2" nails placed into the      tread's back edge will discourage any separation.    </p>    <p>      To finish the stairway, you'll need to add the balusters      and handrails. It used to be common for the balusters, or      spindles, to be dovetail-joined to the overhang at      the side of each step. Today, they're usually fitted to      sockets in the handrail and tread (or nailed or screwed,      two to a tread, at the bottom).    </p>    <p>      Premanufactured railings and fastening hardware are often      used because of the work involved in shaping those finish      parts; they're popular enough that almost any size and      style is common stock. If you make your own, be certain to      fasten the handrail securely with long No. 12 wood screws      to the newel post and a structural wall member above.    </p>    <p>      Stair building is still one of the skills that's by and      large left to the experts. But with a good foundation in      the basics, you'll be able to tackle small, outdoor-deck      stairways, and to better plan those in a contracted      house-building project. And, who knows, once you have a      little experience under your belt, you might be ready for      the <em>next</em> step!    </p>
