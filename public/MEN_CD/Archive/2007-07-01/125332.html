        <p>It's hard to resist the lure of the outdoors during these summermonths. But whether it's a chore, a meal or a simple frolic thatbeckons you into the open air, you're likely to be stung, feastedon or just irritated by bugs.</p><br /><p><strong><u>Prevention</u></strong><br /> Rather than reaching for manufactured insect repellents that usepowerful chemicals to keep bugs at bay, try these tips to naturallyprevent bug bites.</p><br /><p><strong>Wear</strong><strong>light-colored, loose-fittingclothing</strong> when outside. You'll lower your chances ofpopping up on a mosquito's radar, as these bugs are attracted todark colors and easily bite through tight clothing. Also avoidwearing bright or floral patterns, as resembling a scrumptiousflower can make you attractive to bees and wasps.</p><br /><p>Even if you don't have a pool or pond, you still need to<strong>eliminate standing water</strong> around your home, whichis an invitation for mosquitoes to lay eggs near your abode. Drillholes in the bottoms of things like trash bins to drain water thatmay collect in them. Change birdbaths and pets' water dishes atleast once a week and as often as possible in the summertime towipe out any breeding grounds mosquitoes may have created. Checkfor other standing water sources, such as gutters, flower pots andchildren's toys.</p><br /><p>Rosemary, basil, catnip,<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Natural-Health/2007-08-01/Grow-Mosquito-Repellent.aspx" target="_blank">lemon balm</a> and rose geraniums are a few of the <strong>plantsyou can grow</strong> that have insect-repelling qualities. Lemonbalm and catnip are especially good for warding off mosquitoes:Researchers at Iowa State University found the essential oil incatnip to be about 10 times more effective at repelling mosquitoesthan DEET, the widely used synthetic repellent. Simply crush theleaves of any of these plants to release their s cents and rub themon your exposed skin.</p><br /><p><strong>Make your own catch-all insect repellent</strong> from aconcoction of essential oils:</p><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>2 ? teaspoons total of any of the following essential oils:<em>basil, cedarwood, citronella, juniper, lemon, myrrh, pine, rosegeranium or rosemary (available at health food stores)</em></li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>1 cup 190-proof grain alcohol (available at liquor stores)</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Place ingredients in a jar with a tight-fitting lid and shakevigorously. Transfer to a small bottle for storage. To use, rub asmall amount on exposed skin, though test first to make sure skindoesn't react negatively.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ul><br /><p>Don't like measuring and mixing? Buy an herbal insect repellent<a href="http://www.vitaminshoppe.com/search/en/query.jsp?q=insect+repellent&intsource=main" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br /><p>An irritating mosquito to humans is welcome nourishment to<strong>bats</strong>.
