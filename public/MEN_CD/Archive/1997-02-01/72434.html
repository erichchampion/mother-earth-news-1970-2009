                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>What      happens when you can't afford the best treatment?</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Andrea Looney, DVM    </h5>        <p>      For many animal lovers and owners who face decisions about      the health and care of their pet, the most difficult      problem can be a matter of balance between what we feel in      our hearts is right for our animal friends and what can be      achieved both practically and, unfortunately, economically.      For example, if a dog is diagnosed with a tumor or a horse      with laminitis, both potentially fatal problems,      veterinarians often suggest treatments including surgery,      chemotherapy, or other drugs that will definitely treat the      problem and may provide months or even additional years of      life for the animal. However, if the owner has a somewhat      modest or, worse yet, restricted income, the thousands of      dollars involved in these treatments might not be available      to treat the pet in such an optimum way.    </p>        <p>      In situations like this, we all know what we would ideally      like to do. However, for many folks, this best-treatment      plan simply may not be an option. Should owners sell their      car, move into a cheaper apartment, or forfeit the house so      that their pet can live six months longer? I wish these      were simple hypothetical dilemmas for many companion animal      owners, but, alas, they are not. Where is the balance      between a desire to do what's right for our pets and what's      feasible for us?    </p>    <p>      As a general practitioner, I have become well acquainted      with these gray areas and the complexities which simple      lack of health insurance for pets brings. While we may not      always be able to opt for the best treatment or care, we      can try to be as informed and compassionate as possible, to      alleviate the most pain and suffering we can, and to keep      in mind that basic care for our companion animals should be      no different than care for any member of our family. There      should not be despair in being unable to afford the optimum      treatments for our pets' problems. Indeed, many solutions      to medical and surgical problems often begin and remain      simple, in those gray zones, far from optimum. What matters      is that we do care about the well-being of the pets that      share our lives; and we can bring wisdom and solutions to      almost any of their problems, if we are smart enough to      look for answers. Keep those questions coming!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our six-year-old cat was suffering from a tumor      caused by feline leukemia virus</strong> <strong>and was      euthanized in December. We can't replace her, but I would      like to get another cat sometime if I weren't so afraid it      would get the same thing. How soon is it safe to</strong>      <strong>be thinking of this?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Christa Jackson<br />      Lancaster, OH</em>    </p>    <p>      Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) is transmitted from one cat to      another via bodily fluids - urine, saliva, blood, and      milk. There is no way to tell how your cat was infected,      but one usually assumes that exposure to the virus occurs      through contact with an infected cat. Cats can even get the      virus from their mothers through ingesting infected milk      when they are kittens.    </p>    <p>      The virus usually requires the incorporation of cells into      a cat's blood and bone marrow to remain active and      infective. Outside the body, it dies within minutes. In      rare cases, it can remain infective in the environment for      up to 2-3 days, but, again, this is rare. Thus, there      should be little chance of you having a live virus in the      house or yard to infect a new cat or kitten, unless some      other cat is still spreading the germs.    </p>    <p>      Be sure to have the new cat tested for the disease-a      simple blood test is all that's required. If the animal is      negative, a vaccine can be administered to prevent      infection in the future-or you may simply choose to      keep the cat under dose scrutiny when outdoors in order to      guard against cat fights, the major method of viral spread.      If the animal tests positive, I would recommend retesting      again in 2-3 months as many cats "clear" (get rid of) the      virus over time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>It was recommended that we spay our one-year-old      rabbit. We are worried about the surgery, and it's costly.<br />      Is it worth it?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Janet Allen<br />      Memphis, TN</em>    </p>        <p>      Ovariohysterectomy in rabbits is a common procedure to      perform. However, there are advantages and disadvantages to      having it done. The most common reason to perform an      ovariohysterectomy, or spay, is to prevent uterine      adenocarcinoma (a cancer) from occurring in the uterus,      which all female rabbits are at risk of developing. This      form of cancer is aggressive and difficult to remove once      identified.    </p>    <p>      Spaying a rabbit also prevents the occurrence of      pseudopregnancies which are false pregnancies that occur      after a sterile mating or mounting by other does or female      rabbits. In pseudopregnancies, does pull hair, build nests,      and become aggressive for protective or territorial      reasons.    </p>    <p>      The downfalls to performing a spay often revolve around the      anesthesia. Sadly enough, these animals are often so small      and easily stressed that the drugs we are accustomed to      using for our other companion animals like dogs and cats      may not be appropriate for rabbits. However, if dosed      accordingly certain drugs, even inhalant gases, can be used      safely and effectively to achieve lade of feeling and      suitable anesthesia. The actual surgery is not complicated,      and if the animal is in good health prior to the procedure      it may be worth having her spayed.    </p>    <p>      Weigh the pluses and minuses. If you plan on this rabbit      being around other animals, it is in her favor to have her      spayed because of the behavior changes associated with      pseudopregnancy. Also, as she ages, the risk of developing      the uterine tumor becomes higher, and if she is suddenly      diagnosed with it it's usually too advanced and too late to      have it removed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our border collie, Stella, and four cats play      together constantly. Stalls commonly scratches her ears      after play. Is it possible that she has ear mites from the      cats, and, if so, how do we treat them?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Danny Stamets<br />      Lawrence, KS</em>    </p>    <p>      Otodectes cyanotis (the ear mite) may cause an external ear      infection (otitis externs) in dogs, cats, foxes, rabbits,      and ferrets. The mites live on the surface of the skin and      membranes of the ear canal, and feed by piercing the skin      and ingesting lymph and serum, resulting in a bad      irritation, inflammation, and a lot of crust formation.      There are several species of mites that do the same but      Otodectes is the most common.    </p>    <p>      Ear mites are very persistent and resistant parasites. They      cause the animal to shake its head and scratch or rub the      affected ears. A waxy, dark-brown, flaky exudate, commonly      referred to as "coffee grind" debris, results and      accumulates in the canal. If you look closely, you might      even be able to see small white or flesh colored mites on      the debris.    </p>    <p>      Treatment involves first removing the debris which the      mites create and then ridding the mites themselves.      Instillation of a bland oil (mineral or baby oil), or some      type of cerumen (wax) lysing agent (make sure its      nonalcohol based), into the ear canal on cotton or cotton      swabs may be useful in loosening and removal of the debris.      If the debris is not removed, medication to kill the mites      is ineffective and often times the itchiness remains. Avoid      pouring anything directly into the ear canal; if the ear      drum is ruptured secondary to the mites, this is often very      caustic and may injure the inner ear as well. Also avoid      packing the debris further into the ear as you clean.    </p>    <p>      A particularly useful product for killing the mites often      contains the miticide pyrethrin or some other chemical in      an oil solubilizing base. This can be obtained from your      veterinarian and will kill the mites. Other treatments      include injections of drugs such as ivermectin, which are      effective against the mites but currently not recommended      or licensed for use on all animals, especially collies and      collie cross dogs. These animals have a different barrier      between their blood and brain tissue which may predispose      them to neurologic disease or even death if the wrong      products are used in inappropriate doses or forms.    </p>    <p>      An important treatment for all parasites is cleanliness of      the environment, which means cleaning and vacuuming the      carpets and bedding and hot washing what you can to rid the      area of mite eggs and debris.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our Jersey cattle have been lucky enough to dodge      shipping fever and the severe pneumonia and cough it      brings. But we're interested in purchasing a few cows who      might have had this in their herd, although they look      healthy now. What do you think?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-John Wilson<br />      Eau Claire, WI</em>    </p>    <p>      The disease known as shipping fever is probably the most      serious disease faced by the dairy herd or cattle feedlot      owner. There are several known factors which cause the      complex and some unknown ones as well. Shipping fever is      caused by a bacteria known as Pasturella multocida and a      virus called Parainfluenza working together at a time of      stress. Other viruses may be involved as well. The      characteristic fever (104° F. or higher), loss of      appetite, and nasal discharge commonly appear at times of      stress in the herd or animal, such as moving or shipping,      hence the name shipping fever.    </p>    <p>      Shipping fever differs from simple cold or pneumonia in      that it tends to be quite contagious. Although stress      precipitates the disease, even animals not apparently under      stress frequently come down with it because of its tendency      to spread. Pasturella tends to be the most invasive and      problematic organism and appears to be at the root of the      disease. Pus and infection from this bacteria may clog the      lung, causing pneumonia, cough, fever, and even death.      Animals in the late stages of the disease are reluctant to      move and will stand with their head and neck extended,      gasping for air.    </p>    <p>      The key to treatment is once again prevention. It goes      without saying that you should buy only healthy      replacements. Furthermore, don't buy from commission sales;      buy directly from the farm where the animals were born and      raised if possible. Secondly, regardless of the source,      keep newly purchased animals separated from the main herd      for at least two weeks. In this period, try not to change      their feed suddenly, vaccinate them, or subject them to      frequent handling.    </p>    <p>      To more directly answer your question, it would be prudent      not to purchase any animals with a history of this disease      in their background. This disease is so contagious that the      transfer of animals from herd to herd is likely to initiate      a recrudescence of this nasty underlying respiratory      illness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our Quarter Horse mare is constantly pulling      tendons on the turns. Should she be walked or mildly      exercised right after an in</strong> <strong>jury or not?      We would like to prevent scar tissue from forming, and have      heard different ideas on when to return her to      working.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>- Sarah Malloy<br />      Half Moon Bay, CA</em>    </p>    <p>      The best treatment for a "pulled tendon" - which      classically appears as a swollen, hot, painful back of the      leg or simple vague lameness - is ice, wrapping and      <em>rest, rest, rest</em> ! When an injury first occurs      (within 24 hours), ice should be applied for approximately      one hour, three to four times a day. The ice or cold water      is not only analgesic (pain killing) but controls      hemorrhage by constricting the vessels and slowing release      of inflammatory mediators (chemicals) from the lining of      vessels and cells. Bandaging should be constant, firm, and      uniform to collapse the tissue planes and reduce fluid      buildup between them. Exercise will only aggravate further      injury and shoes should be removed in the early recovery      stage.    </p>    <p>      Within two days of the injury, the repair process begins.      It is at this stage (2-28 days) that <em>controlled, slow      movement</em> stimulates circulation, maintains some      flexibility in the limb, and helps with structural repair      of the tendon fibers if the injury is not excessive.      Passive motion of the limb - your holding and moving      the limb gently - will strengthen the fibers still in      place and decrease the chance of adhesion formation. After      two days, alternating warm and cool (not ice) washes      provides for rapid vasodilatation and increased lymph flow.      Lymph helps clear the injured tendon of waste products from      the trauma.    </p>    <p>      "Sweats" - topical medications that improve      circulation - are also beneficial in this period if      applied appropriately and rinsed from the skin before      reapplication. Hydrotherapy, turbulator boots, or      whirlpools all stimulate circulation, as does the product      DMSO, which can be prescribed by your veterinarian and      should be used with gentle movement. Aspirin,      phenylbutazone, and flunixin are antiinflammatories which      come in oral and injectable forms; these will decrease the      swelling and make movement easier.    </p>    <p>      Within two months, walking can be supplemented with      swimming, underwater treadmilling, or very gentle jogging      exercise. Bear in mind that the longer you are able to      stretch out the rehabilitation period, the better the      chance of healing the tendon completely. Support bandages      should still be used in this period on both the injured leg      and the opposite limb to prevent further tendon damage.    </p>
