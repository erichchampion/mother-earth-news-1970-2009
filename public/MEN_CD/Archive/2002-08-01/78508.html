        <p>Country Lore</p><p>My recycling tip is to check out your local hazardous waste facility.</p><p>Sounds awful, doesn't it? But our facility, actually located in the next county, has an exchange room that everyone is welcome to browse (no exchange needed). People are encouraged to send unwanted paint and other chemicals to the facility rather than improperly disposing them by pouring them down the drain or behind the garage. And our facility managers wisely put anything in good condition into the exchange room.</p><p>I recently went there and picked up a gallon of paint for our shed, metal primer and rust-proof paint, a can of chalkboard paint, latex additive for grouting and a new, never-been-used can of watersealer. The number of paint cans was unbelievable, and there were many different chemical compounds from oven cleaner to fertilizers, all free for the taking.</p><p>How much better to use up rather than throw away what others don't want. It's a great money saver, too.</p><p>MAUREEN UNGER<br />Shawano, Wisconsin</p>
