                <p>      <strong>Energy and Environment</strong>    </p>    <p><strong>      Living off the Grid, Part III</strong>		</p>		    <p>      If you thought hydroelectric power was only practical at      the bottom of a cascading torrent of water... you're in for      a surprise. Tapping the natural force of even small streams      using modern turbines can offer a lifetime's escape from      utility bills.    </p>		<h5 id="byline">		By James R. Udall	</h5>	            <p>      Two years ago, Norm and Sue Benzinger, owners of th Coulter      Lake Guest Ranch, a wilderness retreat in th Rockies, had a      problem: They were seeing too much of the propane delivery      man.    </p>    <p>      The ranch's propane bill had topped $10,000 in      1992-much of it consumed by a generator. Hoping to      slash his energy costs, Norm contacted Ken Olson, a      renewable energy expert who directs Solar Energy      International in nearby Carbondale, Colorado.    </p>    <p>      "He said he had a stream falling down the hillside,"      recalls Olson. "Turned out it was a great water power      site."    </p>    <p>      Working together, Olson and Benzinger installed a      hydroelectric turbine. Now the generator, which used to      drone for hours a day, has fallen silent. A water power      system that cost $6,000 will save $2,500 in its first      winter.    </p>        <p>      Over the last 10 years, small-scale hydropower technology      has taken a quantum leap thanks to the invention of the      microturbine. Inside a metal case that is smaller than a      bread box, a miniature water wheel, not much bigger than a      cinnamon roll, is coupled to a pickup truck generator. When      the wheel is spun by a jet of pressurized water,      electricity is created. The design is simple yet      sophisticated, a triumph of appropriate technology.    </p>    <p>      Progress has also been fueled by the dramatic evolution of      solid-state inverters and load controllers-the brains      in the Benzingers' system. A decade ago, inverters, which      transform direct current (DC) to alternating current (AC),      and con trollers, which govern electrical production, were      dumb, unreliable, and inefficient beasts. Tamed with      computer chips, they now perform the same tasks in a much      more intelligent, reliable, and energy-efficient manner.    </p>    <p>      Together, these advances have revolutionized the world of      homeowner hydro. Because a microturbine requires only a few      quarts or gallons of water per second, it's now possible      for even a slender stream to provide all the electricity a      house or modest farm requires.    </p>    	    <p>      Although this technology sometimes makes sense for people      whose homes are already connected to the utility, it's most      economical for those living, or contemplating, life "off      the grid"-a group that includes homesteaders as well      as farmers and ranchers who irrigate or own water      impoundments. With utilities charging $10,000 or more to      extend power lines a mile, an understanding of hydro basics      can prove valuable indeed.    </p>    <h3>      Water into Gold    </h3>    <p>      Hydropower is one of the oldest forms of alchemy, a way to      convert falling water into wealth. Historically, that      wealth has been measured in many coins: milled flour, sawed      wood, and pumped water. Today, the currency of choice is      most often the kilowatt-hour.    </p>    <p>      By almost every measure, water power is the world's best      energy resource. What's cleaner? Cheaper? Even among      renewables, hydro is a head above. Falling water is more      reliable than the wind, and it works at night, too, unlike      the sun. Per dollar invested, a hydro system will typically      produce three to 10 times more energy than a photovoltaic      (PV) or wind power system.    </p>    	    <p>      Hydro's disadvantage? It discriminates against the many in      favor of the few. The wind and sun are democratic: everyone      gets some. Water does not spread its blessings; it      concentrates them. You either have water or you don't. And      most don't.    </p>    <p>      For this reason, hydropower has always been viewed as a      finite resource. We humans can mine more coal or build more      PV panels, but it's not in our power to make rivers or      invent streams. Today, however, thanks to the inspired      tinkering of a handful of ingenious engineers, the      landscape has changed. No new rivers have been created, but      the horizon has moved nonetheless, the scope for alchemy      extended. Good hydro sites remain rare. But they're less      rare than ever before. Now even a brook or creek can be      spun into gold.    </p>    <h3>      A Typical System    </h3>    <p>      In the vocabulary of hydro experts, the word typical is      typically missing. "Every site is different," they insist.    </p>    <p>      "Every installation, unique:" Talking to them, you get the      impression they'd sooner cut off a finger than com pose a      rule of thumb.    </p>    <p>      That said, the system at the Coulter Lake Guest Ranch is,      in many respects, typical. A short distance uphill from the      lodge is a screened concrete box, the <em>intake,</em>      which channels water into a pipe or <em>penstock.</em>      After falling downhill, the penstock terminates in a small      shed or, to give it its fancy name, <em>powerhouse.</em>      Inside are the turbine, generator, batteries, inverter, and      load controller. After passing through the turbine, the      water flows out of the powerhouse through another pipe and      into a rock-lined ditch or <em>tailrace.</em>    </p>    <p>      What is most remarkable about the setup is its water      source-a spring-fed ditch three feet wide and six      inches deep. Just half this piddling quantity feeds the      turbine, enough to produce 400 watts continuously, plenty      to power the Benzingers' lodge or a home.    </p>    <p>      To anyone familiar with electricity, that statement may      sound absurd. After all, 400 watts is only enough power for      four 100-watt lights-and a refrigerator momentarily      draws 1,500 watts when its motor starts. But 400 watts,      over 24 hours, is 9,600 watt-hours. And, believe it or not,      that will amply fuel a modern version of what Zorba the      Greek once jokingly referred to as the "complete      catastrophe": husband, wife, kids, fridge, freezer, washing      machine, dishwasher, microwave, computer, VCR, stereo,      Dustbuster, Crockpot, plus a garage full of power tools.      Note that these are standard, 110-volt tools and      appliances-Makita, Kenmore, Maytag, whatever. You're      not outfitting your house from an RV catalog.    </p>    <p>      There is, of course, a hitch. In most residential systems,      you can't use an electric stove, electric hot water heater,      or electric clothes dryer. They guzzle too much juice. No      baseboard heat, either. For cooking, drying, and space      heating, a hydro household will rely on sun, wood, and      propane.    </p>    <p>      But wait. If a system only provides 400 watts at one time,      what supplies the surges of power needed to start that      refrigerator motor? For that matter, where does the power      come from when 10 lights, stereo, washer, computer, and TV      are all running in the evening?    </p>    <p>      Batteries. An inverter draws juice stored in a battery bank      to start motors and meet evening and morning peak needs.      The batteries recharge when the lights go off, or the next      day when the kids are at school.    </p>    <p>      Thus, if you are willing to heat your food, home, and water      with some combination of propane, wood, and sun, then a      300- to 500-watt system will provide all the electricity      you need and then some. Nor is 300 watts the lower limit,      particularly if you use energy-efficient lights and      appliances. A 50-watt turbine, the Lil Otto manufactured by      Bob-O Schulze, can power a weekend cabin, while 100-200      watts is adequate for an energy-conscious household. Don      Harris, who built the Benzingers' machine, runs two houses      and his shop (lathe, mill, etc.) on 150 watts of      hydropower.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT'S YOUR HEAD AND FLOW?</strong><br />      These two most important variables dictate how much      hydropower can be produced.    </p>    <h3>      What About the Cost?    </h3>    <p>      If the owner of a PV system needs more power, they buy      another module or two. In hydro, though, what you have is      what you have. Moreover, the correlation between how much      money a hydro system costs and how much power it generates      is not linear. Sometimes it's inverse. A marginal site may      cost more to develop, yet generate less power, than a prize      winner. It all depends on stream size, penstock length, and      other variables.    </p>    <p>      That said, a 400-watt system would typically cost $4,000 to      $6,000, broken out like this: turbine, $700-1,000;      batteries, $800-1,600; solidstate inverter and load      controller, $1,200-2,000; transmission line and other      electrical equipment, $500- 1,000. To this, add the price      of penstock pipe (in some systems, the largest single cost)      and of the intake, powerhouse, and labor.    </p>    <p>      Once you've bought a system, "fuel" is free. Since hydro      systems are very reliable, annual maintenance costs should      be $100 or less. But plan on replacing the batteries every      decade or so.    </p>    <p>      Smaller systems are less expensive. A weekend cabin setup      might run $800 to $1,500. And if you already own a wind      power or PV system, adding a hydro turbine to help charge      your batteries can cost as little as $400.    </p>    <p>      So far we've been talking about DC or "battery-based"      systems, where alternating current is supplied by an      inverter. But if you are blessed with water-say, 10      times more than you need for a DC system-you may be      able to dispense with the inverter and generate AC      directly.    </p>    <h3>      AC Systems    </h3>    <p>      Nine years ago, David Scott, a teacher who lives six miles      off the grid near Gypsum, Colorado, got tired of trudging      through the snow each morning to start a propane generator.      Back then, his family was using 6,000 gallons of propane      each winter to provide heat, hot water, and electricity to      the three buildings on their property. Energy costs were      eating them alive.    </p>    <p>      One summer Scott installed a hydro system. It wasn't cheap.      Expenses-not including his time or use of a friend's      backhoe-were $14,000, half of it for 4,000 feet of 8"      pipe. By the end of August, though, Scott was the proud      owner of a 35,000-watt (35-kilowatt or 35-kW), hydro system      that, in his words, "sounds like a Boeing 747 when you turn      it on:" (It ought to: Water enters his turbine at 98 mph.)    </p>    <p>      This system generates a staggering amount of electricity,      whose retail value is about $21,000 a year. Since there's      no utility to sell it to, Scott uses it to light and heat      his house, a guest house, and a 1,600-ftz apartment. The      surplus goes through a transformer and then to a neighbor,      who uses it to heat and power <em>his</em> house.    </p>    <p>      Although Scott's AC system is much larger than most, it      illustrates the possibilities. Over an eight-year span,      it's been shut down four times for routine maintenance. And      with a useful life of 50 years or more, it's already paid      for itself many times over.    </p>    <p>      "Just in Colorado, there are probably dozens of places that      could be doing this," says Scott. "Few people realize how      fairly simple it is."    </p>    <p>      Although AC systems cost $7,000 to $20,000 and up, they      provide much more electricity than a battery-based system      at a cheaper per unit cost, often including a surplus that      can heat a hot tub, radiant floor, greenhouse, or what have      you. But one principal advantage of an AC system-no      batteries-is also a principal constraint. An AC      system must be big enough to start a refrigerator motor,      with power left over to meet evening and morning peaks. For      this reason, most AC systems are 3 kW or bigger, with 5 to      8 being optimal. Below 2 kW, you'll have to go with DC and      an inverter.    </p>    <p>      There is rarely any need to agonize over the AC versus DC      choice, because generally speaking it doesn't exist. At      nine of 10 sites, AC isn't an option. The reason has to do      with <em>head</em> and <em>flow.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Sizing Your System's Potential    </h3>    <p>      Short of having our computer size your system's potential,      the chart below will give you a good idea of how much      output in watts you may expect per different gpm (gallons      per minute), for varing feet of head. Multiply the number      of watts by 24-watt-hours to get the total number of      watt-hours generated in one day. Divide this by system      voltage to get your amp-hour per day output.    </p>		       <h3>      Hydro Physics    </h3>    <p>      "What's your head and flow?"    </p>    <p>      Call Powerhouse Paul to talk hydro and that's the first      question he'll ask. These variables dictate      everything-how much power can be produced, what type      of turbine is best, what size penstock pipe is required,      and so forth.    </p>    <p>      Head (or "drop" or "fall") is the vertical distance between      the intake at top and turbine at bottom. Flow is the      quantity of water passing through the turbine.    </p>    <p>      Hydropower texts are replete with arcane equations, but the      relationship between head and flow is not complicated. To      determine your site's power potential, multiply the two.      For example, a site with 10 units of flow and one unit of      head will produce 10 units of energy, as will a site with      one unit of flow and 10 units of head.    </p>    <p>      In the equation, head and flow are equally valuable. On the      ground, though, head trumps. Yes, power can be generated at      heads as low as three feet, but this re quires tremendous      quantities of water, large turbines, expensive diversion      structures, and expert planning. For backyard applications,      you'll want at least 15 feet of head, and preferably 50      feet or more. On the other hand, you don't need much flow.      Microhydro isn't really "garden hose" technology, but in      terms of water required, it's close.    </p>    <p>      Recall that 400 watts will power a house. To generate that      we'd need approximately: 100 gallons a minute falling 50      feet. Or 50 gallons a minute falling 100 feet. Or 25      gallons falling 200 feet. Or 16 gallons-a mere      <em>quart</em> each second!-falling 310 feet.    </p>    <p>      The implication is clear. A rill, tiny brook, step-across      creek, mountain spring, irrigation ditch-with enough      head behind it-trickle of water from any of these can      produce a torrent of power.    </p>    <p>      As head drops below 50 feet, power production diminishes      and the economics of small hydro systems become      increasingly tenuous. Nonetheless, if you've got a small      pond a mere 25 feet above from which you can divert 100      gallons a minute, you can still generate 200 watts. Combine      that with efficient lightbulbs and appliances, and you've      got energy independence.    </p>    <h3>      Surveying a Site    </h3>    <p>      Okay, you've got a possible hydropower site. How do you      assess its potential?    </p>    <p>      Two people can survey most sites in a day or less. You'll      need a notebook, pencil, stopwatch, tape measure, bucket,      shovel, and plastic tarp. Wear tennis shoes. Your feet will      get wet.    </p>    <p>      Head first. Although a topographic map or handheld      altimeter will provide a rough idea, more precise      measurement requires some sort of level. In open terrain,      use a builder's level or transit, four-foot carpenter's      level, or cigarshaped sight level.    </p>    <p>      If you know what a transit is, you probably know how to use      one. To use a carpenter's level or sight level, cut a staff      of known height a few inches shorter than you are tall.      Start at the proposed turbine location. Put the level on      the staff and center its bubble. Then sight along it as      your assistant climbs the hill. When his or her feet are      level with your eye, have them stop. Bring the level up to      that point and continue in this fashion uphill. At the      intake, total your results.    </p>    <p>      In brushy terrain, use a water level-a 50-foot length      of tubing attached to a plastic container-that can be      snaked around trees, rocks, and other obstacles. Water      levels are accurate and easy to use. They can be bought for      $30 or cobbled up for $10.    </p>    <p>      A third method-perhaps simplest of all-exploits      the fact that every foot of head equals 0.43 pounds per      square inch (psi) of water pressure. Screw two or more      hoses together, carry them to the intake and fill with      water. Attach a pressure gauge to one end and carry it      downhill. Note the pressure. Bring the other end to that      spot (keep the hose full!) and repeat. At the bottom,      divide your psi readings by.43. That's your head. Keep      track of hose lengths, too, and you'll know how long your      penstock needs to be.    </p>    <p>      Head is fixed. It won't change in a lifetime. Streamflow is      trickier. It's always in flux. Are you measuring during      snowmelt? In the dry season? After a big rain?    </p>    <p>      Since any single measurement of flow is probably      unrepresentative, it's best to measure flow repeatedly over      the course of a year. What you want to establish is the      reliable yield. Try also to establish a winter flow, since      that's the season you'll probably use most electricity.      This will help you determine how close hydro will come to      meeting your energy needs.    </p>    <p>      There are many ways to measure flow. For a shallow stream,      three or four feet wide, the bucket-and-stopwatch method is      simplest. Build a temporary dam with stones, dirt, and      plastic tarp, leaving an outlet to one side. Next,      improvise a trough (a piece of culvert or metal roofing      works well) to channel the entire stream into a container      of known volume. Time how long it takes to fill. If a      five-gallon bucket fills in 15 seconds, the flow is 20      gallons per minute.    </p>    <p>      As stream size increases, measuring flow becomes more      difficult. Unless you contemplate an AC system, it also      becomes somewhat less important. Remember, if you've got 50      feet or more head, two gallons a second is all you really      need.    </p>    <p>      The best way to measure stream flow in large streams is to      dam them with a wooden weir, with a rectangular opening of      known size in its center. (Sometimes easier said than      done.) Next, measure the difference in height between the      bottom of that opening and the top of the pond that forms a      few feet upstream. Plug this measurement into a "flow rate      weir table" (found in a hydropower textbook) to get your      flow.    </p>    <p>      Strive to be accurate as you measure head and flow, but      don't worry if you're off by a few inches or ounces. Close      enough is good enough.    </p>    <h3>      Regulations and Red Tape    </h3>    <p>      After measuring head and flow, and estimating your power      output, you decide to build. The first step is to obtain      the necessary permits. Here, generalizations really are      useless. In some states, small hydro systems aren't      regulated. In others, they get lumped in with domestic      water systems, which rarely encounter permitting problems.      (If you are developing a new homesite, design your penstock      to provide both water and power.) Finally, there are      states, California for example, where the red tape is more      formidable.    </p>    <p>      In truth, many people fail to get a permit, either as an      act of civil disobedience or because they fear bureaucrats      who strain at gnats while swallowing camels or because they      just don't want to bother. But this can be risky.    </p>    <p>      Remember, water regulations are designed to protect you as      well as the resource. It's worth jumping through a few      hoops to guarantee your water rights.    </p>    <p>      With this is in mind, the best approach is to find out what      the law is, <em>then</em> decide how to proceed. In most      cases, it's easy to comply. Begin by calling your state      energy office or water resources department.    </p>    <p>      So much for humanity's laws. How about Nature's?    </p>    <p>      In contrast to huge dams whose reservoirs invariably wreak      immense havoc, home-owner hydrosystems impound no water and      have few environmental impacts. Nonetheless, taking too      much water out of a stream, even if its only for a few      hundred yards, can raise its temperature enough to kill      fish and other aquatic life. Diverting the entire flow is a      hanging offense-or should be. In California, during dry      years, Don Harris will close his intake for months at a      time. (He uses photovoltaics for backup power. PVs dovetail      nicely with hydro: If it's not raining, the sun is usually      shining.)    </p>    <p>      If you have any questions about the impact of your system      on salmon, salamanders, or frogs, Harris suggests that you      explore them with the biology department of the nearest      university or the local fish and game department.    </p>    <p>      Remember, we all live downstream.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOLLOW NATURE'S LAW</strong><br />      Diverting too much from a stream can easily kill fish and      other life.    </p>    <h3>      Do It Yourself?    </h3>    <p>      In most cases, the answer is yes. Indeed, you may <em>have      to</em> simply to keep costs within reason.    </p>    <p>      With the help of reference books from the library and guide      sheets from turbine manufacturers, any reasonably adept and      persistent person can design and install a hydro system. Be      forewarned, though: It will cost more and take longer than      you expect. Since there is a learning curve involved,      expect some head-scratching. Here's a primer to get you      started.    </p>    <p>      The most trouble-prone point of a hydro system is the      intake. A poorly designed diversion structure is a constant      migraine. If you want to get it right the first time, study      the site in detail. Ask yourself. What happens in a      drought? A flood? And remember that uncontrolled      diversions, however brief, may cause mudslides and horrific      erosion.    </p>    <p>      In many cases, a small rock or log dam is built to create a      pool a few feet deep. This traps silt and provides a place      for the intake pipe, usually located in a concrete or      plywood box. Often it's easier and wiser to divert water      away from the stream to a 55-gallon drum, stock tank, or      tiny pond and begin the penstock there. In any case, the      intake must be screened to prevent leaves and gravel from      being sucked down the pipe. To avoid endless trips up the      hill, design the screen to be self-cleaning.    </p>    <p>      The penstock should be as short, straight, and steep as      terrain permits. Avoid undulations and abrupt changes of      direction. Most penstocks are polyvinyl chloride (PVC) or      polyethylene pipe.    </p>    <p>      PVC is generally cheaper. Unfortunately, sunlight degrades      it, and it will shatter if it freezes. A plugged penstock      at minus 30 is the worst nightmare imaginable. In a perfect      world, every penstock would be buried to protect it from      falling trees, freezing, bears, and other mischief. But      many aren't. If you intend to leave PVC on the surface,      paint it before installing it. In a cold climate, be sure      to insulate it with fiberglass wrap or a thick layer of      straw.    </p>    <p>      Although polyethylene pipe can be more difficult to install      than PVC and, in large diameters, more expensive, it is      also much more frosttolerant. Where winters are frigid and      the penstock won't be buried, it is the choice. Be      forewarned though: Unrolling a coil of poly is like      wrestling a 100-foot python.    </p>    <p>      Sizing the penstock involves a tradeoff. The smaller the      pipe, the cheaper its cost. But friction (and thus power)      losses increase as pipe diameter decreases. So, the longer      the penstock, the larger the pipe needs to be. Most      household systems have 2"-4" penstocks, although AC systems      often require 6", 8", or larger.    </p>    <p>      A powerhouse doesn't have to be large or expensive. A      concrete floor is nice, not essential. Plan the equipment      layout so that maintenance will be convenient. And be sure      to install a pressure gauge and shutoff valve upstream of      the turbine. This gauge is your troubleshooting tool.      (Pressure higher than normal? A turbine nozzle is plugged.      Pressure too low? The problem is uphill, probably at the      intake.) Powerhouses are generally sited on the stream      bank, which makes them vulnerable in a flood. Make sure      yours is out of the floodplain!    </p>    <p>      A complete discussion of the many kinds of hydro turbines      is beyond the scope of this article. Although each type has      its niche, there is a great deal of overlap. Most      home-owners use either a Pelton or Turgo. (These are      designs, not brand names.) At heads over 50 feet, both work      well. Since a Turgo can handle more water, it's often the      choice for lower heads. If you are very handy with a      welding torch and want to build your own turbine, build a      cross-flow-a squirrel cage-like contraption efficient      across a wide range of head and flows. (MOTHER sells      plans.) For more on turbines, contact the manufacturers      listed below.    </p>    <p>      Transmission lines can be run overhead, but underground is      neater and safer. They need to be properly sized for      current and distance. It's not uncommon for the powerhouse      to be a few hundred feet away from where the electricity is      being used. Beyond this, however, you'll need to step the      voltage up. In extreme cases, power can be pushed a mile or      more.    </p>    <p>      Experts recommend that you seek an electrician's services      when it comes to wiring. DC, AC, inverters, controllers,      batteries-leave this to a pro. Insist that the      installation meets the National Electric Code. Your life      depends on it.    </p>    <p>      By now it should be clear that installing a hydro system      isn't a weekend project. It's a long, sweaty job that might      take a few weeks or even a summer. At the end, however, you      can look forward to a moment of bliss: turning on the      penstock valve for the very first time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>For Further Information</strong><br />      <br />      Workshops<br />      Hands-on hydropower classes are offered by Solar Energy      International, Carbondale, CO (303) 963-8855; and, in      Canada, by Robert Mathews, Chase, B.C.

"He was      just fascinated with falling water," says New. "I never      understood it, until the day he let me turn on the penstock      valve. When the lights came on, I was instantly hooked:"    </p>    <p>      "I see water pouring out of a storm sewer, and I      immediately start calculating head and volume," says New.      "I can't help it:'    </p>    <p>      The hydro turbines he makes are at once simple and      sophisticated. A metal shroud surrounds a wheel. The shroud      is pierced by a nozzle. The nozzle emits a jet of      pressurized water. Moving at up to 100 miles an hour, it      strikes the wheel. The wheel is a turbine's heart.      Spinning, it pumps electrons.    </p>    <p>      The wheels are surprisingly small and surprisingly      beautiful. In this market, a nine-inch wheel is a giant.      Harris' Pelton is just six inches across. Cast of bronze,      its complex geometry is a work of art, a hydrodynamic      sculpture. "What's elegant is the electricity:" New      retorts. "You and I, we take power for granted, think it      comes from an outlet on the wall:"    </p>    <p>      "Energy is eternal delight," wrote the poet William Blake      two hundred years ago. Throughout history, a good hydro      spot was coveted and many a town was founded at a mill      site. In 1880 there were 23,000 waterwheels between Maine      and Georgia, and hydro supplied much of this nation's      energy. By the turn of the century, 27 independent      laboratories tested turbine designs.    </p>    <p>      "The shape of a Peltonwheel was perfected 70 years ago,"      says New. "In those days, before NASA, biotech, computers,      nuclear physics, half the nation's brains were working on      it:'    </p>    <p>      During the Depression, small hydro was eclipsed by      mega-dams such as Hoover and Grand Coulee. Cheap,      subsidized power from the Rural Electrification Association      was the industry's death blow.    </p>    <p>      Today, however, it is enjoying a quiet revival. The current      hotbeds are the Rockies, California, and British Columbia.      The future, though, may lie overseas. Pakistan, Cuba, Peru,      Laos-village power. There are 2 billion people out there      with no electricity. If they all get it by burning coal      ...well, let's hope global warming is a myth.    </p>    <p>      Already, New has installed systems in Morocco and New      Guinea. His latest project was in the Aleutians. "I just      love to unplug diesel generators," he says. Harris,      meanwhile, is on his way to the highlands of Bolivia, where      almost every village has an untapped stream.    </p>    <p>      So it goes with hydro enthusiasts. Motivated not so much by      money as by the chance to continue playing in that ditch      other boys forget when they grow up, they achieve a sort of      immortality. Since a turbine's useful life is 50 years or      more, wheels stamped HARRIS and NEW and CUNNINGHAM will      still be spinning long after their makers are dead,      transforming falling water into eternal delight.    </p>
