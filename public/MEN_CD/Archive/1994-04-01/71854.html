                <p>      <strong>Mother's Kitchen</strong>    </p>    		<p>      Four nutritious meals your family will love that can be hot      and ready in 20 minutes!		</p>		<h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>        <p>      Around midafternoon most any day at the school where I      work, my female coworkers ask one another, "What are you      making for dinner tonight?" There will be a variety of      responses ranging from chicken tetrazzini to, "Does anyone      have the phone number of Tony's Pizzeria?" Panic has set in      and the daily dilemma must be resolved before departing for      home just in case one needs to stop by the grocery. I      seriously doubt that the male employees ponder this topic      while power lunching. "So, Stan what do you think about the      merger?" "Sorry, I wasn't listening, Fred. I was trying to      remember if I took the chicken out of the freezer this      morning:'    </p>    <p>      The truth is, women are still preparing most of the family      meals while juggling a job and raising children. This is a      far cry from the life we imagined, growing up watching mom      baste a roast in her shirtwaist dress and heels on "Leave      It to Beaver."    </p>    <p>      Sure, who wouldn't like to have dinner prepared and on the      table in 20 minutes? But TV dinners remind us of airline      food. Tuna noodle, macaroni and cheese, and Hamburger      Helper are not the healthy fast foods that we had in mind.      And take-out can't be anything more than a very occasional      luxury in my house. Since we're living in the low-fat '90s,      we need to get our hands on some ideas for healthy fast      foods. Maybe these meals won't be what we'll serve when the      boss comes to dinner, but they'll be fast, affordable, and      nourishing to our hungry masses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A TWO-MEAL IN MINUTES<br /></strong> Editor Claire      Conway takes charge of her ramen soup while the skillet      chicken awaits.    </p>    <h3>      Ramen Soup    </h3>    <p>      Ramen instant Asian-style noodles are sold in packages that      include a seasoning packet for soup. Most supermarkets      carry them in the Asian section or the soups can be found      in many varieties in health food stores. We like the      Westbrae Natural Curry or 5-Spice Ramen.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 package Ramen soup<br />      1 teaspoon oil (sesame oil is good, but any oil is      fine)<br />      2 cloves garlic, finely chopped<br />      5-6 thin slices fresh ginger root, peeled<br />      2 cups unsalted chicken broth (1 can)<br />      1-2 cups water<br />      1 tablespoon soy tamari<br />      few drops chili oil (optional), to taste<br /></em> <em>1/2      package firm or extra firm tofu, drained and cut into</em>      <em>1/2 " cubes</em> <em><br />      2 cups broccoli or snow peas, cut into bite-size      pieces</em><br />      <em>3-4 green onions, chopped fine</em><br />      <em>1-2 cups mung bean (Asian-style) sprouts</em><br />      <em>cilantro leaves, chopped (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Saute the garlic and ginger for a few seconds. Add the      broth, seasonings, and seasoning packet. Simmer 10 minutes.      Bring to a boil, add the noodles and vegetables, and reduce      heat. Add more water if needed. Simmer about 5 minutes      until the vegetables are crisp-tender. Serve topped with      green onion, sprouts, and cilantro, if you so desire.    </p>        <h3>      Skillet Chicken with Peppers    </h3>    <p>      <em>6 chicken thighs, skinned and cut in half (have the      butcher do the cutting-he's faster)<br /></em> <em>2      teaspoons olive oil<br />      5 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 large red pepper, cut into strips<br />      1 large yellow pepper, cut into strips cup white wine<br />      1 ripe tomato, cut into eighths<br />      1 teaspoon dried thyme-or 2 teaspoons fresh<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      few dashes cayenne pepper<br />      parsley, chopped (optional)<br />      12 ounces egg noodles or rice (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      In a large skillet (I use a nonstick), heat the olive oil      over medium-high heat. Add the chicken pieces,      sautéing them 4-5 minutes on each side until brown.      Stir in the garlic and peppers. Sauté a few minutes      until the peppers start to brown. Add the wine, then lower      the heat to medium and add the tomato, rosemary, salt, and      pepper.    </p>    <p>      Simmer uncovered for about 8 minutes or until the liquid is      reduced and the chick en is done. Top with chopped parsley.      Serve with noodles or rice.    </p>    <h3>      Tortilla Casserole    </h3>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon mild oil<br /></em> <em>1 large clove      garlic, minced<br />      1 medium onion, chopped<br />      2 small zucchini, quartered lengthwise and then thinly      sliced<br />      1 medium red pepper, diced<br />      1 15-ounce can small red beans or pinto beans, rinsed and      drained<br />      1 cup corn (fresh or frozen), uncooked teaspoon ground      cumin<br />      1 cup (8 ounces) mild or medium green taco sauce or      salsa<br />      6 corn tortillas (1 use stone-ground yellow cornmeal      tortillas), cut in half<br />      2 cups low fat cheddar cheese</em> <em><br /></em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350°F In a 2 1/2-quart casserole,      sauté in the microwave or on the stove the garlic,      onion, zucchini, and red pepper in the oil for a few      minutes until limp. Stir in the corn, beans, and cumin, and      remove from heat. Remove the vegetables and set aside.    </p>    <p>      Pour the salsa into a shallow bowl. Dip the tortilla halves      one at a time into the salsa. Place a layer of tortillas in      the bottom of the casserole. Next spread some of the      vegetable mixture, then some of the cheese. Repeat this      procedure 2 more times.    </p>    <p>      Bake, uncovered for about 30 minutes until the cheese on      top is slightly browned. Cool a few minutes and cut like a      pie to serve.    </p>    <h3>      Fast Food Ideas    </h3>    <p>      Taking time to plan saves time in the long run. Make up the      week's menu the day before you grocery shop and write your      grocery list. I plan seven dinners, plus food available for      breakfast and lunch. Plan on having leftovers for lunch to      recycle for dinner. Broil chicken one night and use the      leftover chicken tacos or a casserole the following day.<br />      Don't feel guilty if you ocassionally serve frozen waffles      with fruit or a vegetable omelette for dinner.<br /> Keep a      folder handy with your family's fast-food recipes from      cookbooks and magazines to keep in the folder. (It's      difficult to prepare a 20-minute meal if you spend 10      minutes searching for a recipe.) Keep menus from carry-out      restaurants, delis and pizzerias in the folder for meal      emergencies.<br /> Keep your freezer stocked with items such as      ground turkey for burger or burritos, pizza crusts, pita      bread, or tortillas, freshly fround parmesan or romano      cheese, and frozen fruit and vegetables for emergencies.<br />      Instead of making salads or side dishes, stick to one main      dish when you're pressed for time. Cut up fresh fruit and      vegetables along with some breadsticks for the family to      munch on while you make dinner.<br /> Grocery shopping: Look for      convenience items that save without sacrificing nutrition,      such as deboned chicken, roast turkey, peeled baby carrots,      grated cabbage, and pre-cut spinach. Avoid packaged foods      that are high in sodium, sugar, fat and additives. I take      advantage of the supermarket's salad bar with its washed      and chopped greens and vegetables.<br /> Keep your pantry stocked      with marinara sauce, chicken broth, canned tomatoes, pasta,      boxed grains, canned beans, and refried beans. Make sure      you have on hand the ingredients needed for your "fast-food      folder." Have condiments such as salsa, chutney, mustard,      vinegar and wine available to quickly add flavor to food.<br />      Draft family members to assist you-a spouse or older      children-to chop vegetables or grate cheese while      younger children set the table.    </p>    <h3>      Turkey-Noodle Casserole    </h3>    <p>      This is my answer to tuna-noodle casserole. I buy a chunk      of cooked roast turkey in the deli section of the      supermarket. The casserole can be prepared the day before      and popped into the oven when you walk in the door.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 teaspoon butter<br /></em> <em>1 small onion,      minced.<br /></em> <em>1 package cream of chicken soup from      health food store (I use "Mayacamas")<br /></em> <em>skim      milk (look at soup package for amount)<br /></em> <em>1      teaspoon cooking sherry<br /></em> <em>1 teaspoon dried      dill<br /></em> <em>cayenne pepper, salt and pepper to      taste<br /></em> <em>2 cups broccoli, cut into bite-size      pieces<br /></em> <em>1 small red pepper, cut into thin      strips, then in half<br /></em> <em>8 ounces cooked turkey      or chicken, cut into bite-size pieces<br /></em>      <em>10-12-ounce package noodles (I use whole grain      noodles)<br /></em> <em>1 cup grated cheddar cheese (low      fat is fine)<br />      1/2 cup toasted whole wheat bread crumbs (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Put large pot of water to boil for noodles. In saucepan      sauté the onion in butter for about a minute, then      stir in dry soup mix and liquid, according to the      directions, using half the amount of liquid called for. (If      you want, you can use part skim milk, part water if you      want a lower fat content.) Stir in the sherry, dill, and      seasonings and simmer the sauce until thickened.    </p>    <p>      Add the turkey, broccoli, red pepper. Boil the noodles      until done and drain. Combine the soup mixture and the      noodles in a 1 1/2-quart casserole. Top with cheese.      Sprinkle bread crumbs on top if desired. Bake uncovered at      350 F for about 25-30 minutes. Serves 3-4.    </p>    <h3>      Glazed Apples and Ice Cream    </h3>    <p>      <em>a dab of butter-about 1/2 teaspoon<br />      1 firm apple such as a pippin or Granny Smith, cored,      seeded, and cut into thin slices<br />      1/2 teaspoon cinnamon</em><br />      <em>1 tablespoon apple juice or cider<br />      1 tablespoon maple syrup</em>    </p>    <p>      Over medium-high heat, stir fry the apples in hot butter      until they start to soften. Reduce heat, stir in the      cinnamon, cider, and maple syrup. When the maple syrup has      thickened and formed a glaze, remove from heat. Let them      cool for a minute or so before spooning over vanilla ice      cream or frozen yogurt (or try different flavors).    </p>    <h3>      Carob Mousse    </h3>    <p>      Aseptic-packaged Nori-Nu brand "silken" tofu works the      best. Unopened, it has a long shelf life, so keep some on      hand for pudding.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 package firm "silken" tofu</em><br />      <em>3 tablespoons real maple syrup (or honey)</em><br />      <em>1/2 cup carob chips (barley malt sweetened)</em><br />      <em>1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />      dash cinnamon</em><br />      <em>1 teaspoon instant espresso powder (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      Melt the carob chips and maple syrup in a glass measuring      cup in the microwave or in a saucepan on the stove on low      heat. Stir mixture until just <em>melted; be</em> sure not      to overheat.    </p>    <p>      Put in blender with the rest of the ingredients and puree      until smooth. Make a point of letting the mousse chill at      least 2 hours before serving.    </p>
