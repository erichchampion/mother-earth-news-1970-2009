                        <p>      <strong><em>WARNING!</em></strong> Butterflies can be      addictive!<br />      So say many new books on butterfly identification, and the      number of “butterfliers” to join the sport in      the last decade seems to confirm this. A new style of field      guide (see listings, Page 67) that allows identification on      the fly, rather than requiring the butterflies be netted      and killed, is partly responsible. Anyone who has used a      bird guide will be comfortable with this method, and with      using a pair of short-focusing binoculars that allows you      to study a butterfly as close as your foot without scaring      it away.    </p>    <p>      At the start, new butterfly gardeners concentrate on      attracting adult butterflies by adding nectar plants to      their landscapes. But curiosity and logic soon drive them      to wonder about the other side of the life cycle, and      that’s where the fun really begins.    </p>    <p>      Gardeners and other plant lovers often find the study of      butterflies particularly rewarding because it offers      fascinating glimpses into why plants are the way they are.      Like most herbivores, butterflies have a preferred meal      plan - in fact, many species are so finicky about      their choice in food plants for their caterpillar stage      that their survival rates rise and fall on the success of a      single plant species. The coevolutionary dance between      plant and insect is an amazing story of defensive      strategies attempted, overcome, improved and overcome once      again.    </p>    <p>      Plants “retaliate” for being chomped on by      developing special poisons or distasteful chemicals. We      humans have many reasons to be grateful for this process      - the herbivore pressure on plants has led to      wonderful adaptations, both medicinal and flavorful. Mints,      oregano, spicy nasturtium leaves and pine resin are good      examples. Most of the aromatic smells, unique tastes and      medicinal properties we enjoy in plants came about as      defenses. Butterflies are only the visible tip of the      iceberg when it comes to the world of insect herbivores      driving these botanical experiments - but they are so      wonderfully visible!    </p>    <p>      Plants’ chemical-defense plans generally work, but      eventually an insect comes along that finds a way to      neutralize the poison, or better yet, put it to a good use.      The relationship between monarch butterflies and milkweed      is a celebrated example. The poisonous glycosides in      milkweed repel most herbivores. But monarch caterpillars      not only eat the leaves, they harmlessly store the      glycosides on into adulthood. Birds learn quickly to avoid      these brightly colored butterflies after the first vile      taste.    </p>    <p>      Over time, as the plant ramps up the concentration of the      compounds, the insect eating it adapts. But success comes      at a cost - eventually, the butterfly becomes      dependent on those compounds, which it needs to trigger      both egg-laying behavior and larval feeding. Apollo      butterfly larvae eat stonecrop and store for defense a      compound from it called sarmentosin. Red admirals nibble      safely on nettle leaves. Pearl cres cents need asters.      Fritillaries only eat violets (though you won’t catch      them at it since the caterpillars retreat into the ground      during daylight). Skippers cue in on grasses. Cabbage      whites eat, well, cabbages. (Leave the Bt spray off one of      your cabbage or broccoli plants to encourage those      delightful butterflies.) <em>And so it goes, for most      species.</em>    </p>    <p>      With the exception of a few butterfly species that migrate      in, it is the presence of larval food plants that generally      determine local butterfly populations. These plants are      almost always native to the area. If your yard and garden      consist of mowed lawn and non-natives, you probably      aren’t offering much larval habitat. You can remedy      that by dedicating an area to host plants - a good      field guide will help you figure out what plants your local      butterflies use. Leaving parts of your property in a wild,      untended state is probably one of the best things you can      do for these beauties. And unless you have a specific pest      problem to control, ignore gardening advice that says to do      an autumn cleanup to remove all dry leaves and perennial      stalks - it is just those protected places where      caterpillars and chrysalides spend the winter. Not only      will you have better butterfly habitat - you will      have more time to sit still and be enchanted by the      spectacle of butterfly life. - <em>Carol Mack</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Marvelous Milkweed</strong>    </p>        <p>      You can attract monarch butterflies to your yard by      planting a patch of milkweed, a very easy-to-grow native      perennial that produces seed pods with those downy white      tufts many of us love to set free on the wind. And      you’ll get a bonus if you grow milkweed: The young      shoots and flower buds are edible, plus the unique fluffy      floss in the mature seed pods makes a superb alternative to      expensive goose down for use in insulated vests, jackets      and even comforters.    </p>    <p>      You can boil young milkweed shoots and leaves for an      asparaguslike vegetable. (Avoid mature leaves and stalks,      which are bitter.) Young flower buds and very young pods      have a pealike flavor. The flowers can be used as a      thickener for soups and can be boiled down to make a sugary      syrup. - <em>Christina Bolas</em>    </p>
