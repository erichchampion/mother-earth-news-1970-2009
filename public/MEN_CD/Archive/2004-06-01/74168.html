                    <p>      <em>At our off-the-grid Arizona home, we conserve water to      help protect this fragile ecosystem.</em>    </p>    		 <p>      When we moved from rainy Portland, Ore., to Cochise County,      Ariz., in 1999 to build a 1,200-square-foot solar, straw      bale, completely off-the-grid house, we went one step      further than most folks and decided it would be easier on      the local environment if we didn't drill a well. We live in      the Chihuahuan desert, an area that only gets an average 11      inches of rain per year (for the past few years the average      has been closer to 7 inches!), so rather than depend on an      already overtaxed aquifer for our household water needs, we      decided to install a rainwater harvesting system. We      conserve water carefully, but we live quite comfortably      with this limited supply.    </p>    <p>      Protecting the natural beauty and rich wildlife habitat of      the nearby San Pedro River, which is directly dependent on      water from the aquifer, is our motivation for saving water.      We live in the upper San Pedro River watershed, near one of      the few cottonwood-willow riparian corridors in the      Southwest. The river is familiar to many birders and      scientists, and National Geographic featured an article on      it in April 2000, written by the well-known author and      Tucson, Ariz., resident Barbara Kingsolver. More than 300      species of birds visit this corridor during their seasonal      migrations.    </p>    <p>      Sadly, the San Pedro is going the route of many other      Arizona rivers: It may be in the early stages of drying up.      Perhaps foretelling disaster, the growing number of people      who reside in the upper San Pedro watershed use more than      double the amount of water that is recharged into the      aquifer each year. As the aquifer's level drops,      increasingly larger portions of the river are disappearing,      leaving dry gravel beds where Sonoran mud turtles and Gila      topminnows once swam.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOING OFF-THE-GRID</strong>    </p>    		 <p>      With money we saved while living in Oregon, we built our      straw bale house, doing almost all of the construction      ourselves, with some help from family and friends. We lived      in a small camp trailer on the property for more than a      year while building. During most of that period, we were      able to take some time off from work; then as money ran      low, we transitioned to part-time and then fulltime jobs.      Right now, both of us work as counselors for the county      health department.    </p>    <p>      Our house was built as cheaply as possible; we scavenged      windows and doors, cabinets and tile by asking people who      were remodeling their homes if we could have their used      materials. Our completed home is both cozy and beautiful.      Because we did not contract out any of the work (including      the concrete foundations and floors!), we were able to      build without a mortgage. Not having to make monthly      payments on a house is liberating, but what provides even      more satisfaction is knowing that we are actively making      choices to minimize our impact on our very sensitive      environment.    </p>    <p>      Our solar-powered home runs on a very simple photovoltaic      (PV) system that we installed ourselves. The entire cost of      the equipment - array, battery bank, charge controller and      a 1,300-watt inverter (designed for motor homes) amounted      to less than $3,000. We are able to run our television and      VCR, stereo, microwave, toaster, vacuum, water pumps, fans      for cooling and all our lighting, as well as our power      tools. Our only inconvenience so far is incredibly minor:      We cannot run the microwave and the toaster at the same      time.    </p>    <p>      Our refrigerator and stove run on propane. We use 7-gallon      propane bottles and refill them as needed at the local gas      station, 15 miles away. We talk of having a 200-gallon tank      installed and serviced by the local propane company, but      the inconvenience of filling bottles hasn't yet pushed us      to that expense. Most of the year, each 7-gallon bottle      lasts four to five weeks, and we have two. During the      winter, if we have to use the propane heater, a 7-gallon      tank may last only 3Y weeks. But we rarely need to use the      heater because the winters are relatively mild and our      house has many passive-solar design features. Large      south-facing windows combined with the thermal properties      of our straw bale walls and sunlight-storing concrete      floors keep us toasty warm; we only need to heat with      propane when we get three cloudy days in a row during the      winter, which rarely happens here.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLLECTING RAINWATER</strong>    </p>        <p>      We put on the roof and began collecting water before we had      even finished the walls. We have about 1,200 square feet of      roof area, and even the most liberal estimates on water      catchment ascribe only 960 gallons per inch of rain for a      roof that size. Using the 11-inch rainfall average for our      region, we figure we potentially could collect 10,560      gallons in an average year, which is only a small fraction      of the nearly 150,000 gallons a typical North American      household uses.    </p>    <p>      We have only 6,000 gallons of storage capacity, but since      our region only receives rain during the summer and winter,      we are able to fill the tanks in the summer, use some water      in the fall, and then top the tanks off again in the      winter. The toughest time is between February and July when      the dry winds suck away every drop of moisture. Our stored      6,000 gallons has to last through this period.    </p>    <p>      We have a roof "washer" that we built ourselves, a device      that diverts the first 5 gallons of water that come off the      roof. This helps to keep the dust and any other materials      that may be on the roof out of our water storage tanks. We      also have a screened intake area to keep contaminants out      of the water and a filtering system to further purify it.    </p>    <p>      The poly tanks used to store drinking water are expensive,      running about $1,000 for a 3,000-gallon tank, so we started      with just one and added the second tank later. At some      point we could add a third, but so far we haven't found      that we need that much water.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAREFUL CONSERVATION</strong>    </p>        <p>      Even with low-flow toilets, you'd be surprised how much      good, clean, drinking-quality water gets flushed each day      in this country. Our first conservation measure was to      install a composting toilet, which uses no water.      Composting our waste also is good for the soil, as we use      the mature compost around our trees. True, there is some      maintenance involved in a composting toilet, but ours has      required only minimal upkeep.    </p>    <p>      Any inconvenience to us pales in comparison to the      inconvenience to the Sonoran mud turtles who are no longer      able to migrate up and down the river. And to be perfectly      honest with you, there is something satisfying about being      responsible in this way for our own waste.    </p>    <p>      We also have perfected the art of showering. We had good      training, because before we installed plumbing, we had to      haul water by hand. During that time, we decided that the 5      gallons our solar shower could hold was more than      sufficient for two bathings. Taking short showers has      become ingrained, but just to keep us honest, we installed      a low-flow showerhead with a stopping valve and a 6-gallon      hot water heater. If you wish to take a long shower at our      house, you have to be prepared to take it cold! Also, to      not waste any more water than necessary, we often keep a      bucket in the shower and dump the collected water on the      garden.    </p>    <p>      To wash dishes, we fill the sink only a few inches. Rather      than running water over the dishes to remove food      particles, we first wipe the dishes down, separating out      the food residues for composting. That keeps those few      inches of water clean far longer, and we can wash a larger      load with less water.    </p>    <p>      All our drains (except the wash side of the kitchen sink,      which is by law required to go to the septic tank) go to      trees we have planted, so the water gets reused      immediately. We have a small, 12-by-4-foot kitchen garden,      which we occasionally have to stop watering, but only      during periods of extreme drought. Then, we have lost some      plants, but not all. Our landscaping plants have fared      particularly well because we specifically chose      droughttolerant species - most of them native to the area -      including palo verde trees, mesquites and desert willows.      When we started rainwater harvesting, we were using      rainwater for drinking and cooking, but more recently, we      switched to store-bought water for drinking.    </p>    <p>      The reason was that our roofing material - uncoated      galvanized metal - is no longer considered the safest      material to collect drinking water because when it begins      to corrode, the metal could introduce contaminants into our      water supply. So we decided to be cautious with our      drinking water; however, we still use harvested rainwater      for most of our cooking.    </p>    <p>      The one luxury we have forgone thus far has been a washing      machine; we take our laundry to a laundromat. Right now,      this adds to our consumption of water from the aquifer, but      we hope to soon buy a super-efficient machine for home. We      should have enough water, given the average rainfall, but      the droughts of recent years have left us unsure.    </p>    <p>      Last year was an especially dry year. We began the annual      February-to-July drought with only 2,500 gallons in the      tanks, and were down to only a few hundred gallons before      the tanks began to refill during the rainy season.    </p>    <p>      But, we survived just fine with even that small amount of      water, and our rationing was by no means unreasonable or      uncomfortable. We still took daily showers and were able to      give some water to the plants.    </p>    <p>      This tells us that with the return of normal rainfall      patterns, we should be able to wash our laundry at home      provided we buy a water-efficient washer. Some use as      little as 18 gallons per load while most machines on the      market use 40 to 50 gallons!    </p>    <p>      All in all, we have carved a satisfying life out of the      harsh environment that is the Chihuahuan desert. We have      created a lifestyle where we can live simply and cheaply      without sacrificing comfort. This life is not for everyone,      perhaps, but for us, it is the realization of a dream that      we built slowly over the years. We hope those of you who      share such dreams may be fortunate enough to realize them      as we have.    </p>
