                    <h5 id="byline">      by Claire Hagen Dole Illustrations by Steve Buchanan    </h5>    <p>      Have you ever stopped in the midst of your garden chores to      watch a bright yellow swallowtail as it lands on a      coneflower? If you approach slowly, you may be surprised at      how close you can get to a feeding butterfly. With a hand      lens, gaze at its compound eye, its overlapping wing scales      and its long proboscis, uncoiled like a soda straw to sip      nectar. Keep that hand lens at the ready. You’ll      discover a fascinating world within your butterfly garden:      Watch a female butterfly as she lays eggs on the undersides      of leaves, and marvel at the development of tiny      caterpillars within the eggs during the next few days. Keep      an eye out for gobbling caterpillars pausing to shed their      too-tight skins, and jewellike chrysalides dangling from      branches as the insects inside transform into dazzling      adult butterflies.    </p>    <p>      Like all living organisms, butterflies are classified      within the Linnaean system. Thus, a painted lady (Vanessa      cardui) belongs in the kingdom Animalia, phylum Arthropoda,      class Insecta, order Lepidoptera, family Nymphalidae, genus      Vanessa and species cardui. Butterflies and moths make up      the order Lepidoptera, which means “scaly      wings.” There are nine times as many moths as      butterflies, a remarkable fact considering that scientists      have classified almost 20,000 species of butterflies      worldwide. Most inhabit the tropics; about 700 species can      be found in North America, north of Mexico. In addition,      many tropical vagrants are spotted occasionally in Florida      and the Southwest.    </p>    <p>      What determines a butterfly’s placement within one      family? It may share family characteristics such as wing      structure, behavior or caterpillar host plants. For      example, butterflies in the large family Nymphalidae are      called brushfoots because they all have short, brushy      forelegs. They also tend to be strong, fast fliers.    </p>    <p>      A good regional guidebook, with geographic range maps and a      caterpillar host plant index, is invaluable (see      “More Butterfly Information,” Page 67, for a      few recommendations). Your own observations on behavior,      such as wing posture while basking, will aid in      identification and bring greater pleasure to your butterfly      watching, too. Here’s an overview of butterfly      families to look for in your garden:    </p>    <p>      <strong>Whites and Sulphurs</strong>    </p>    															    <p>      These medium-size butterflies with wingspans from 1 to 3      inches can be found in gardens, fields and disturbed areas.      Whites, which may have greenish marbling on the undersides      of their wings, lay eggs on mustards (Brassica). They are      strong fliers but do not wander. The cabbage white is the      most common white, and its caterpillar is a common pest of      cabbage and broccoli plants. Sulphurs, named for their      yellow coloration, may disperse in large numbers in the      fall - perhaps as a response to a sudden population      boom. Both male and female sulphurs are avid puddlers      (sipping minerals from wet soil; see tip No. 7, Page 66).      Their caterpillars feed on legumes such as alfalfas      (Medicago) and clovers (Trifolium).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Coppers, Blues and Hairstreaks</strong>    </p>    <p>      Known as gossamer wings, the butterflies in this family are      tiny, with wingspans from seven-eighths to 2 inches, and      have iridescent wings. As color distinctions can blur, a      field guide is useful: There is a blue copper, and many      female blues are coppery in hue. Hairstreaks are named for      a hairlike tail on each hindwing. Near the tail, they often      have an eyespot, creating the impression of a head with      antennae. They rub their hindwings together to confuse      predators into attacking that end. All rest with their      wings closed. Tiny, sluglike caterpillars of blues and      hairstreaks may associate with ants, which protect them in      exchange for protein-rich secretions. They often pupate in      leaf litter and may overwinter in this stage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Swallowtails</strong>    </p>    <p>      Colorful and large, with wingspans of up to 5 1/2 inches,      swallowtails glide into your garden seeking nectar from a      variety of flowers. They often flutter their wings while      feeding, perhaps as a means of keeping balance. Their      hindwings have tails that distract predators into attacking      their rear rather than their more vulnerable head. Male      swallowtails engage in puddling and hilltopping (swooping      over a ridge to investigate territory and seek mates). The      caterpillars may resemble bird droppings or have fake      eyespots behind their heads. Many caterpillars have an      osmeterium, a forked organ behind the head that emits a      foul odor when the caterpillar is threatened. Most      swallowtails overwinter as a ridged green or brown      chrysalis attached to a tree or building with one strand of      silk.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Brushfooted Butterflies</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Members of this large, diverse family, which includes      admirals, true brushfoots, longwings, satyrs, milkweed      butterflies and fritillaries, are named for their short,      brushlike forelegs - which make them appear to have      only four legs. Mostly medium-size (wingspans from 1 1/2 to      4 inches), brushfoots have wings that are often partly      orange. They may have cryptic markings on their undersides      to camouflage against tree bark or soil. Brushfoots are      strong, fast fliers. Some, most notably monarchs, migrate      long distances in spring and fall.    </p>    <p>      Many brushfoot caterpillars are covered with wicked barbs,      which protect them from predators and parasitic wasps. They      may feed in groups for safety, or rest during the day and      feed at night. The chrysalides are often angled and knobby,      with clearly defined wing shapes. They hang from branches,      without silken girdles (strands of silk).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Admirals</strong>    </p>    <p>      Medium in size, with wingspans from 2 to 3 1/2 inches,      admirals are attracted to tree sap and wet soil, but they      also will visit garden flowers. Some gain protection from      predators by mimicking unpalatable species: Viceroys look      remarkably like monarchs, and red-spotted purples resemble      pipevine swallowtails. Tiny caterpillars overwinter inside      a rolled-up leaf, attached to a tree with silk. In spring,      they crawl out to feed on new foliage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>True Brushfoots</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some of our most familiar garden butterflies fall into this      category. Painted ladies, red admirals and California      tortoiseshells often disperse from the Southwest in great      numbers in late spring. Buckeyes spread north in summer,      then migrate south in the fall. Mourning cloaks (shown at      right) are widespread and frequent open woods and suburbs.      Because of their long life spans, they need additional      nutrients and seek minerals and amino acids from rotting      fruit, tree sap, animal scat and carrion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Longwings</strong>    </p>    <p>      Longwings, or heliconians, are tropical butterflies with      long, narrow wings. They have wingspans of 2 1/2 to 3 3/4      inches. All use passion flowers (Passiflora) as host plants      - a diet that renders caterpillars and adults      distasteful to predators.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Satyrs</strong>    </p>    <p>      Mostly medium-size, with wingspans from 1 to 2 7/8 inches,      satyrs are dull brown or gray, with several eyespots along      the edges of their wings (see wood nymph satyr at left).      They blend into their grassy habitat when basking with      wings closed. Satyrs fly weakly near the ground and are      more likely to seek tree sap than nectar. The two-tailed      caterpillars overwinter in leaf litter or attach themselves      to grass blades with silk. In spring, they form smooth      chrysalides on grass blades or in litter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Milkweed Butterflies</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of this tropical subfamily, the monarch and queen are the      main North American butterflies. Their large orange wings      spanning 3 to 4 inches warn predators that they taste bad,      due to toxins they ingest when feeding on their primary      host plants, the milkweeds (Asclepias). They are strong      fliers, undertaking long migrations in spring and fall.      Caterpillars are boldly striped in warning colors of      yellow, black and white. The rounded chrysalides, hanging      from branches, are celadon-green with a band of gold dots.      They become transparent, revealing the orange wings within      about a day before the butterflies emerge.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Fritillaries</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fritillaries inhabit northern and alpine regions. Bright      orange with a checkered pattern, they range in size from      small to large (wingspans from 1 1/2 to 3 3/4 inches), with      most falling in the middle. Violets (Viola) are their      primary caterpillar host plants. Greater fritillaries, such      as the great spangled fritillary, also are called      silverspots, for the silvery markings on the wing      undersides. Misnamed for its orange coloration, the gulf      fritillary actually is a longwing.    </p>    <p>      Adapted from The Butterfly Gardener’s Guide, edited      by Claire Hagen Dole and one of the Brooklyn Botanic      Garden’s All-Region Guides.
