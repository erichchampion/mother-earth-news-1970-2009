        <p id="byline">I've long been impressed by the simplicity of many of the homemade water heaters developed by MOTHER's researchers. And now I want to tell all of MOM's energy-conscious readers about a solar "breadbox" device that <em>I've</em> come up with.</p><p>My unit's absorber/ storage tank was salvaged from a discarded water heater. I welded legs onto the cylinder and installed an inlet fitting to send the cold water to the bottom of the tank. Then I painted my creation with "hi-temp" flat black paint.</p><p>The tank sits in a plywood box, the inside of which is <em>generously</em> insulated with fiberglass. Acrylic plastic (with a couple of galvanized wires for support) is used for the window, and all interior box surfaces facing the water tank are lined with polished sheet aluminum.</p><p>My creation's only <em>moving</em> part is an insulated door/reflector that I open every morning and close at night (it's angled just right for catching the low-slung winter sun. . . making the box even more efficient in January than it is in July).</p><p>The exterior surfaces are covered with durable sheet aluminum. The pipe that carries the solar-heated water - as well as any cold water pipes exposed to the outdoors - is also well insulated.</p><p>Since installing this simple solar device (which supplies preheated water to our conventional hot water tank), we've had more hot water <em>and</em> a lower power bill. The out-of-pocket costs for my entire project totaled $65 ... and I've been so pleased with the heater that I'm building <em>another</em> one: a modified version of the original unit, which promises to snag even more free BTU than does my <em>first</em> design!</p><p><em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For more information on MOTHER's solar water heater designs - as well as on wind, hydro, methane, alcohol, anal more - buy a copy of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) Guide to Home Energy.
