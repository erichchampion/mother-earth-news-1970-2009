                <p>      Anyone who lives (or vacations) near either of North      America's coasts can grow (or gather) a supply of good      seafood!<br />    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">By Les Stanwood</h5>    <p>      Nearly everyone who's been to the seashore has encountered      mussels . . . the sharp-shelled mollusks that cling in huge      colonies to rocks, ropes, and pilings. However, many folks      <em>don't</em> know that - besides being among the      most common North American coastal shellfish -      mussels are one of the sea's best sources of food. They're      easy to gather . . . high in protein, minerals, and      vitamins B-1 and B-2 . . . and <em>extremely tasty</em> .      Furthermore, under proper conditions the little saltwater      wonders can be <em>farmed</em> , harvested, and sold at a      nice profit!    </p>        <p>      <strong>A SHELLFISH SAMPLER</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are <em>several</em> varieties of this prolific      mollusk, and a majority of the species are edible . . .      though not all of them are palatable. Most seafood fans      feel that the Northern Blue Mussel ( <em>MytiLus      edulis</em> ), with its blue black shell and deep violet      interior, is the sweetest and most delicious. Abundant from      the Arctic to Cape Hatteras, the "blue" is found in most      eastern American waters north of the 35th parallel, as well      as in Europe . . . in a few coastal areas of California      (where it's been introduced) . . . and even in parts of the      Southern Hemisphere.    </p>    <p>      Only a bit less tasty, in the opinion of most folks, is the      <em>Modiolus rectus</em> - a glossy, dark brown      mussel with a white interior - which is found from      Vancouver, B.C. to southern California . . . and      <em>Mytilus californianus</em> , the light brown California      Mussel. (However, a number of varieties that flourish along      the southeast coast - from New Jersey to Florida      - are usually thought of as barely edible. These      include the Atlantic Striated Mussel, <em>Modiolus      demissus</em> , and the Bent or Hooked Mussel, <em>Mytilus      recurvus</em> . )    </p>    <p>      The common shellfish are very easy to gather . . . all a      hungry forager has to do is locate a colony of mussels and      pry his or her dinner loose from its moorings. The      specimens residing in deeper water will be the plumpest,      because they've had the best opportunity to feed. While      those found higher up on the beach are not      <em>poisonous</em> , as some folks believe, they      <em>are</em> less meaty (the shallow water clusters are      also more likely to include dead shellfish).    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMMONSENSE CAUTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Since mussels feed on plankton and other microscopic      organisms, they <em>can</em> absorb toxic substances,      including those resulting from industrial or residential      pollution. Therefore, <em>any</em> expedition to gather      shellfish (clams, oysters, <em>or</em> mussels) should      begin with a call to the local health department to see      whether the waters are polluted or afflicted with "red      tide" . . . the name given a phenomenon - caused by      certain plankton - that can make all mollusks in an      area temporarily poisonous. (Because of the latter      naturally occurring hazard, mussels are quarantined, along      the California coast, from May to October . . . and in      other regions during various portions of the warm-water      seasons.)    </p>    <p>      The saxitoxin that the microscopic organisms create is a      powerful paralyzer for which there's no antidote. If you      take in enough, you'll go numb all over and stop breathing,      sometimes within half an hour.    </p>    <p>      Other than the lab tests which health departments routinely      make, there's no easy way to know when your area's      shellfish might be affected by a red tide. (Some people      think that the "glow" that sometimes appears in sea water      - also caused by micro-organisms, and called      "bioluminescence" - is a sure signal of danger . . .      but some luminescent plankton is nontoxic, and some toxic      plankton is nonluminescent. )    </p>    <p>      Nor can you you lessen the poisonous effects through any      method of cooking or pickling. And <em>don't</em> count on      a small "taste test" to warn you, because - during      heavy plankton blooms a single, three-inch mussel could be      deadly. Play it safe and check with the health department      before you gather!    </p>    <p>      (A mild case of shellfish poisoning begins with numbness      and tingling around the lips and tongue and moves to the      face and neck. There may also be a "prickly" feeling in the      toes and fingertips as well as some dizziness, headache,      and nausea. If the problem is more severe, the speech will      become incoherent . . . the limbs prickly, stiff, and      uncoordinated. There may be a rapid pulse and some problem      in breathing. Extreme saxitoxin ingestion is characterized      by great breathing difficulty, muscular paralysis, and      choking. If you experience <em>any</em> of these symptoms      after eating <em>any</em> shellfish, have someone take you      to the hospital right away.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>FORAGE A FEAST</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've checked and found that your waters have been      declared safe for shellfish foraging, get whatever license      might be required (the local Fish and Game Commission      office can give you all the necessary information). Then      - equipped with a sharpened tire iron or heavy-bladed      knife and a gunnysack or other container - you can      set out, at low tide, on your search.    </p>    <p>      Mussels are tastiest when they're from two to three inches      long. As you gather them, make sure the shells are closed      tightly - or that they snap shut when you grab the      creatures - and don't collect any mollusks that are      full of sand. (To avoid taking more than you can use, keep      in mind that two dozen mussels per person will constitute a      hefty meal! )    </p>    <p>      Back at home, your harvest should be scrubbed clean and the      "beard" ( the byssus threads that mussels spin to attach      themselves to inanimate objects <em>and</em> to one      another) should be pulled out or clipped off just prior to      cooking. (They <em>can</em> be left on as "handles" if you      plan to eat the mussels right out of the shell.)    </p>    <p>      Prepare the marvelous morsels as soon as possible after you      gather them. If you can't consume your catch right away,      however, you <em>can</em> keep them - on ice or in      <em>cold</em> fresh water - for a day or two.    </p>    <p>      You'll find the little mollusks easy to cook. You can steam      them in wine, beer, or water (use about 1/2 cup of liquid      for two dozen mussels, and let them simmer for eight      minutes) or bake them at 400°F, with 1/2 cup of liquid,      for 15 to 18 minutes. They'll "announce" when they're ready      by opening wide. ( Remember that the less the shellfish are      cooked, the better they'll taste . . . and that the meat      tends to shrink if it's overdone.) The following recipes      are just a few of the ways you can prepare your foraged      feast:    </p>    <p>      <strong>STEAMED IN BEER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cook a couple of slices of onion and some garlic ( the      amount of which will be determined by your enthusiasm for      the aromatic herb) in 3 tablespoons of butter . . . then      add 1/3 cup of minced parsley, some pepper, and 1/2 cup of      brew. Put this mixture in a Dutch oven with a couple of      dozen freshly scrubbed mussels, and let them simmer for 8      or 10 minutes (or, again, until the mollusks have opened .      . . throw away any mussel that stays closed). Serve the      seafood with melted butter and napkins!    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSSEL CHOWDER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Steam a few dozen mussels in water and remove the meat.      Then strain the juice through cheesecloth and add clam      juice (if needed) to make 1-1/2 cups of liquid. Chop and      sauté an onion, a stalk or two of celery, and a few      carrots in butter and add a touch of rubbed thyme, a bay      leaf, and a cup of chicken broth. Combine this with the      "mussel juice" and cook a cup of diced potatoes in it. In      15 minutes add the shellfish meat, 1-1/2 cups of      half-and-half, and a bit of parsley. Heat it again to      serve, but <em>don't</em> let it boil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSSELS AND RICE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fry up 1 medium-sized onion, 1 cup of mushrooms, and some      garlic (to taste). Pour in the rice ( use 1 cup to serve 4      people) and let it cook for 3 minutes. Add 1/2 cup of      pitted, black olives and 1/2 cup of sweet pimentos. Using      mussel juice (strained) or chicken broth, add 2 parts of      liquid to 1 part rice. Cook the dish for about 15 minutes,      or until the juice is absorbed, on medium-low heat. Stir in      the meat of a few dozen steamed mussels (and a dozen or      more shrimp, if you have them on hand) . . . cook the      mixture for 2 more minutes . . . and sprinkle it with      parsley before serving.    </p>    <p>      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: For some other delicious mussel      recipes, see</em> Euell Gibbons' Stalking the Blue-Eyed      Scallop <em>(David McKay Company, Inc., $3.95), which is      available in many bookstores and libraries.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSSEL FARMING</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now that you know how easy it is to <em>gather</em>      mussels, you may think it's ridiculous to talk about      <em>raising</em> them. But cultured mussels have a number      of advantages over their wild cousins. First, homegrown      shellfish are usually meatier and better tasting. Second,      the foraged mussels sometimes contain ugly black "pearls",      harmless but crunchy parasites not found in the farmed      variety. Third, the domesticated mollusks are more readily      available, and - when you grow your crop suspended      from floats - you don't even have to wait for low      tide to harvest. Finally, cultured mollusks are easier to      <em>market</em> .    </p>    <p>      There are a number of ways of raising mussels. In Holland,      "seed" shellfish spawn are spread along the bottom of      shallow inland seas where they grow to maturity, while in      France it's common to see the mollusks thriving on oak      poles driven into the ocean bottom. The most popular and      successful method, worldwide, is to grow them on ropes      suspended from rafts.    </p>    <p>      The <em>easiest</em> technique for a <em>family</em> -sized      saltwater crop, however, is simply to culture the mussels      on the pilings of an old pier. Assuming that you can obtain      permission to utilize such a structure, you'll be able to      start farming for a minimal investment. The mollusks will      either grow there of their own accord, or you can gather      small mussels from a low-tidal bed ( collect them from an      area with few barnacles, if you can find such a spot) and      transplant them to the posts from June or July through      September.    </p>    <p>      Medium-gauge netting will hold the "youngsters" in place      for the two weeks or so it will take for them to become      attached to the poles. Once that happens, you can work at      thinning them and keeping away predators ( mostly starfish,      sea squirts, perch, flounder, moonsnails, oyster drills,      crabs, and birds) . . . or you can just let nature take its      taxes, and keep the survivors for yourself.    </p>    <p>      Most successful commercial mussel farmers, on the other      hand, find that the raft method allows the most efficient      use of space, and - because most of the creatures      that prey on the mollusks are bottom dwellers -      keeping the culturing ropes off the sea bed protects the      crop. (Should you plan to use this system, however, you      must accept the fact that the public has not always been      eager to welcome mussel rafts. If you encounter such a      problem, you'd better brush up on your public relations      skills and perhaps offer to split your harvest with one or      two waterfront landowners.)    </p>    <p>      The technique of "raft ranching" is a simple one. You      merely anchor your structure in a bay or cove which already      has a mussel population, and encourage the spawn to grow on      ropes suspended from the float. Most farmers use wooden      platforms or old rubber tires buoyed with foam (or some      other flotation material). It could be a bit expensive to      construct a raft from scratch, but you can often buy old      floats or docks at reasonable prices. ( You can even use a      few tied-together logs, but such assemblies usually sink      after a year or two.)    </p>    <p>      The exact methods of <em>operating</em> a mussel-raising      raft differ a lot from coast to coast, and even from one      bay to the next. In general, the platforms are placed in      waters which have only light currents and are between 30      and 60 feet deep. Nylon or Manila ropes are then spaced      some 30 inches apart and allowed to hang 10 to 30 feet down      into the water . . . with four-inch-long sticks ( lengths      of half-inch-diameter dowel will do) placed every two feet      or so to keep the mussels from sliding off the lines.    </p>    <p>      (The only way to find out exactly what depth and cord      spacing will work best is to experiment . . . unless you      can find another - successful - mussel farmer      in the same cove and copy his or her system.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>CATCHING THE SPAT</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you might well imagine, getting the mussels to      <em>settle</em> on your ropes is sometimes tricky. The      "spat", as mussel spawn is called, is produced in the late      spring. It will attach to almost any substrate it can find,      but if your ropes are set out too soon, other creatures (      such as barnacles) may take up the space. On the other      hand, if you wait too long to position your lines, there      may not be enough spawn to give you a good harvest. The      spat usually begins in early May, and your crop - if      you get one - will become apparent by the end of      July.    </p>    <p>      The spat sets best in the upper two or three meters of      water, so you can either plan to thin the mussels and      reposition some of them along the length of the rope (a lot      of work), or simply run the rope - horizontally      - in the top layers of water during the setting      season. In Spain, where the accumulation of great numbers      of mussels often makes thinning necessary, the outer layers      of shellfish are routinely stripped off and attached to new      ropes with water-soluble rayon . . . which will rot away as      the mussels form webs of their own.    </p>    <p>      (Any thinning or transplanting should be done on overcast      days, since bright sunshine hinders the byssus growth ...      and, even though mussels are generally thought to favor      water with a high light intensity, experiments have shown      that their weight gain can be increased by as much as 69%      by placing sun screens over the timber framework from which      the ropes are suspended.)    </p>    <p>      Your crop will reach good eating size (two inches, plus) in      12 to 15 months, but the precise time of harvest is always,      of course, controlled by red tide conditions. The yield      will vary, but five pounds of mussels per foot of rope per      year is about an average figure for a good operation.      (Current prices range from $1.00 to $2.00 a pound, cleaned      off and delivered - alive and still in their shells      - to restaurants.)    </p>    <p>      Harvesting can be a chore or very easy, depending on how      much care you take. It's possible to raise each line and      pick off only the salable mussels . . . but the procedure      is time-consuming. A better method - according to      many Maine shellfish farmers - is to take off      <em>all</em> the mussels, and then put any too-small ones      back on the ropes.    </p>    <p>      Wash the mollusks well before you market them, getting rid      of the worst clumps of trash, dead shells, stones, and so      forth. But don't break up the mussel clusters themselves      unless your buyer insists; since - if you pull out      the threads from the insides of the little creatures and      thereby damage them - you'll find it difficult to get      your entire crop to market alive.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEADLY RED TAPE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Naturally, there <em>are</em> obstacles that can make      setting up a successful mussel farm pretty difficult. The      worst of them is probably that hideous creation known as      "red tape". Getting permission to put in a mussel raft      requires filling out sheaves of forms. The Army Corps of      Engineers has to rule on your hazard to navigation . . .      the county must decide whether or not you'll be in      compliance with local zoning . . . and every state agency      imaginable must - it appears - rule on your      application.    </p>    <p>      The permit process for a big operation could take as much      as a year to 18 months and cost several hundred dollars.      There is <em>no</em> way to get around the procedure, and      only a few things you can do to ease your way through it.      First, keep your proposal simple. The less expensive your      raft (and the less ambitious the plan), the less you're      likely to be hassled by the bureaucrats. Second, talk to      anyone and everyone who has been through the process      before. And third, apply for as many permits simultaneously      as possible ( an approach which involves <em>more</em> work      initially but, with luck, will shorten your wait).    </p>    <p>      If you're serious about "going commercial" with mussels,      you may have to do your own recruiting of restaurants that      will buy your crop . . . and <em>that</em> can involve      selling the "idea" of mussels as well. Certainly,      <em>no</em> restaurant will buy mussels from an unlicensed      and uncertified shellfish dealer (check with the health      department, again, to learn the requirements).    </p>    <p>      Your crop must be inspected regularly to insure that it      hasn't been affected by "red tide" or pollution. While the      state will usually pick up the tab for such tests, in some      places (especially California) health departments haven't      been anxious to grant permits for mussel farms, because      they don't feel they have the manpower to check on such      operations. You'd better be sure, then, that your product      can be inspected regularly before venturing very far into      largescale mussel cultivation.    </p>    <p>      Also, be sure to take advantage of the reams of available      information on raising your sea crop. A lot of universities      are interested in ocean farming, so a call to nearby      institutions of higher learning may bring as much help as      anyone could need!    </p>

The sharp-shelled mollusks ? which are the most plentiful shellfish along North American coastlines ? are often neglected in favor of more exotic (and less nutritious) bounty from the deep. A skillful-forager ? armed with a sharpened tire iron or heavy-bladed knife and a gunnysack ? can soon pack home a passel of the plump beauties (they taste best when they're two to three inches long) if he or she begins mussels hunting at low tide. Any beachcomber, however, would be well advised to check with the local health department or fisheries authorities before gathering the delectable edibles . . . since industrial or residential pollution may have affected mussel beds. If you're truly enamored of the tasty mollusk, you'll be pleased to learn that new methods have been developed and refined which allow you to raise the shellfish. . . and ? if you'd like ? even market your surplus to local seafood outlets or restaurants. RIGHT: Mmmm-mmmmm ... steamed mussels ? fresh from the sea ? served on the half shell with rice: just one savory, easy-to-prepare dishes you can whip up in a flash with the marvelous morsels.
