                    <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      I've used many ant poisons and many of these so-called      solutions have been pretty costly as I've succeeded mainly      in moving these unwelcome guests from one place to another.      But there is another way, I have discovered that the most      efficient and effective ant killer is something that is      normally lost down the drain-dishwater! After washing      dishes, I collect the water in a one-and-a-half gallon jug      that washing bleaches and detergents come in. I start at      the outside of the ant hill and work toward the center. I      do this as quickly as possible, as ants come to life fast,      and I cover most (if them. When I get to the point that      water goes in the hole, I continue to pour the rest down      into the nest. The ants that come to the surface seem to      die and disappear. The next day I find no activity.<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Harvey Prather<br /></em> <em>Baghdad,      Florida<br /></em>    </p>
