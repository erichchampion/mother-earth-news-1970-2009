        <p>The process of baking bread is like an homage to our past: Oneof our oldest foods is also one of the most satisfying to createfrom scratch. The smell of the classic heart-warmer can no doubtwarm spirits on even the chilliest of days. As fall settles in,here are some tasty recipes for those with bread machines or sturdypalms: The no knead recipe requires neither.</p><br /><p><strong>Fast White Bread</strong><br /> From <em>The Joy of Cooking</em></p><br /><p>This is a quick and easy yeast bread designed to work withquick-rise yeast, regular active dry yeast works too. Stir togetherin a large bowl or the bowl of a heavy-duty mixer:</p><br /><p>2 cups bread flour<br /> 1 tbsp. sugar<br /> 1 package (2? teaspoons) quick-rise or active dry yeast<br /> 1? tsp. salt</p><br /><p>Add:<br /> 1 cup very warm (115 to 125 degrees) water<br /> 2 tbsp. butter or margarine, melted or softened</p><br /><p>Mix by hand or on low speed for 1 minute. Add ? cup at a timeuntil the dough is moist but not sticky:<br /> 1 to 1? cups bread flour</p><br /><p>Knead for about 10 minutes by hand or with the dough hook on lowto medium speed, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Transferthe dough to an oiled bowl and turn it over to coat with oil. Coverthe bowl loosely with plastic wrap and let rise in a warm place (75to 85 degrees) until doubled in bulk, 40 to 45 minutes. Grease a9-by-5 inch loaf pan. Punch down the dough, form it into a loaf,and place seam side down in the pan. Oil the surface and coverloosely with a clean cloth. Let rise in a warm place until doubledin bulk, 20 to 45 minutes. Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. Bakethe loaf for 10 minutes. Reduce the heat to 350 degrees and bakeabout 30 minutes more. Bake until the crust is golden brown. Removethe loaf from the pan to a rack and let cool completely.</p><br /><p>Yields: One 9-by-5-inch loaf</p><br /><p><strong>For Bread Machines: Hearty Winter Bread</strong><br /> From<a href="http://www.cooksrecipes.com/bread/hearty-winter-bread-machine-recipe.html" target="_blank">CooksRecipes.com</a>.</p><br /><p>7/8 cup water<br /> 2 tbsp. butter or margarine<br /> 1 large egg<br /> 1/4 cup molasses<br /> 1/4 cup cornmeal<br /> 2? cup white bread flour<br /> 2/3 cup whole wheat flour<br /> 2? tsp. active dry yeast</p><br /><p>Add ingredients in the order given by the manufacturer of yourbread machine.<br /> Select the sweet or basic setting and desired crust color setting;press start.</p><br /><p>Makes a 2 pound loaf.</p><br /><p><strong>Onion Beer Bread</strong><br /> For onion lovers! This scrumptious recipe from The FlavorfulSeasons Cookbook is easy for anyone.</p><br /><p>3 cups self-rising flour<br /> 1 tsp. sugar<br /> 1/2 tsp. salt<br /> 10 ounces room-temperature light beer<br /> 2 eggs, beaten<br /> 3/4 cup onion, minced<br /> Nonstick cooking spray</p><br /><p>Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Combine all ingredients. Pour intoa lightly sprayed 9-inch loaf pan and bake for about 50 minutes, oruntil a toothpick comes out clean.</p><br /><p>For those without a bread machine or a strong set of hands,there is another option: don't knead the dough at all. That'sright; it's possible to bake bread without any palm workwhatsoever. The<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/08/dining/081mrex.html" target="_blank">NewYork Times</a> posted the following recipe, which actually yieldedan edible loaf of bread for this novice baker. Check out theDecember 2007/January 2008 issue of<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank"><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></a> formuch more on this No Knead bread technique. I recently tried thistechnique for myself and have included my tips and mishaps inbold.</p><br /><p><strong>No Knead Bread<br /></strong>Time: About 1? hours plus14 to 20 hours' rising</p><br /><p>3 cups all-purpose or bread flour, more for dusting<br /> 1/4 tsp. instant yeast<br /> 1? tsp. salt<br /> Cornmeal or wheat bran as needed for dusting <strong>(At mymother's suggestion, I ditched both and just used extraflour.)</strong></p><br /><p>1. In a large bowl combine flour, yeast and salt. Add 1 5/8 cupswater, and stir until blended; dough will be shaggy and sticky.<strong>(The dough will not just be sticky, it will be incrediblygummy.)</strong> Cover bowl with plastic wrap. Let dough rest atleast 12 hours, preferably about 18, at warm room temperature,about 70 degrees. <strong>(I let my dough rise for a full 18 hoursresting on and/or close to a heating pad set on low, to combat thechilly air that had moved in the weekend I chose for myadventure.)</strong></p><br /><p>2. Lightly flour a work surface and place dough on it; sprinkleit with a little more flour and fold it over on itself once ortwice<strong>. (I could not, and did not, 'fold' the dough. It wasso sticky that the best I could do was attempt to turn it over.Luckily, my 'loaf' still rose as it should have.)</strong> Coverloosely with plastic wrap and let rest about 15 minutes.</p><br /><p>3. Using just enough flour to keep dough from sticking to worksurface or to your fingers, gently and quickly shape dough into aball. Generously coat a cotton towel (not terry cloth) with flour,wheat bran or cornmeal; put dough seam side down on towel and dustwith more flour. <strong>(Again, I basically failed at this step.Even though I avoided terry cloth, the towel I choose was stillporous enough that my dough completely cemented itself into it'sgrooves, and I could not keep my hands coated with enough flour toshape the dough into anything, as it was clinging to myfingers.)</strong> Cover with another cotton towel and let rise forabout 2 hours. When it is ready, dough will be more than double insize and will not readily spring back when poked with a finger.<strong>(Luckily, my dough still did this, though it was a hugeamorphous blob, not a neat ball with a seam.)</strong></p><br /><p>4. At least a half an hour before dough is ready, heat oven to450 degrees. Put a 6-to-8-quart heavy covered pot (cast iron,enamel, Pyrex or ceramic) in oven as it heats. When dough is ready,carefully remove pot from oven. Slide your hand under towel andturn dough over into pot, seam side up; it may look like a mess,but that is OK <strong>('Look like a mess' equaled a sticky,no-seamed blob of dough and way too much extra flour hanging out inthe Pyrex dish I used.)</strong> Shake pan once or twice if doughis unevenly distributed. Cover with lid and bake 30 minutes, thenremove lid and bake another 15 to 30 minutes, until loaf isbeautifully browned. Cool on a rack.</p><br /><p>Yield: One 1?-pound loaf.</p><br /><p><strong>(Incredibly, despite all inconsistencies between my loafand the one described in the recipe, I still created asweet-smelling, slightly chewy but honestly and notably deliciousloaf of bread with crispy, golden crust. I just had to dust anembarrassing amount of flour off of it before I sliced itup.)</strong></p><br /><p>You'll also want to check out<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole-Foods-and-Cooking/2007-12-01/Easy-No-Knead-Dutch-Oven-Crusty-Bread.aspx" target="_blank">Easy, No Knead Crusty Bread</a> in the December 2007/January 2008issue of <i><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span></i>.
