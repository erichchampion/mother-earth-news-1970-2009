        Smoothies are one of the easiest ways to work more fruits andvegetables into your diet, and their fresh, fun flavors can winover even the most produce-wary kids. The basic ingredients for anysmoothie are simply liquid plus fruit or vegetables. A smoothie canbe as healthy or low-calorie as you want, and they're a nutritiouschoice for breakfast or an afternoon snack. By making your ownsmoothies, you can control the amount of sugar, calories and fat,and you can easily add beneficial nutrients such as fiber, vitaminC, ginseng or protein powders for an extra boost.<br /><br />Dietary substitutions in smoothies are simple: You can easilyreplace sherbet with regular yogurt to reduce the sugar content, oruse skim milk instead of ice cream for less fat ? withoutsacrificing rich, satisfying flavor. Use milk, yogurt orsilken-style tofu for extra calcium. Try fresh or frozen fruit. (Tokeep your smoothie healthy, avoid fruits frozen in sweetenedsyrup.) Frozen fruit makes a smoothie colder, smoother and thicker;a mix of both fresh and frozen fruit produces the perfectconsistency.<br /><br />When you're preparing the ingredients, keep in mind that thesmaller you chop the ingredients, the smoother your smoothie willbe. Dice ingredients according to your personal preference.
