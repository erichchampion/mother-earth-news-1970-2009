                    <h5 id="byline">      by SAM THAYER    </h5>    <p>      The July and November 2001 issues carried conflicting      reader reports about "highbush" cranberries ("Cranberry      Catharsis" and "Learning to Love Highbush Cranberries").      Such misunderstanding occurs because the common name      highbush cranberry" actually refers to three different      species: Viburnum opulus, V. trilobum and V. edule.    </p>    <p>      John Venable, who found "highbush cranberries" to taste      horrible, lives where V. opulus, an introduced European      shrub, grows. The fruit of this plant is indeed      unpalatable: I don't even consider it to be edible. The      nearly identical V. trilobum, or American highbush      cranberry, grows in the northern United States and the      southern half of Canada. Its fruit closely resembles the      true cranberry in flavor. Every year I make lots of juice,      jelly and sauce from them. Unfortunately, this species      sometimes hybridizes with its distasteful European cousin      (especially near urban areas), polluting its pure flavor.      The confusion between these species isn't helped by the      fact that many botanists don't separate them. One large      nursery even sells the European kind labeled as the      American V. trilobum. In the November issue, Kate      McLaughlin wrote from Alaska, where V. edule (called      "highbush cranberry" or "squashberry") grows. This species      is held in the highest esteem of the three. No wonder her      family raves about her jelly.    </p>    <p>      This confusion has been going on for decades. Now perhaps      you can understand why botanists stick with scientific      names.    </p>    <p>      If you want to try making jam, jelly, sauce or juice from      American highbush cranberries (V. edule), here are some      important tips:    </p>    <p>      • Taste first! If the cranberries taste like medicine,      then they aren't food. They should taste like cranberries.      Good and bad bushes can be side by side.    </p>    <p>      • Harvest after the berries have turned red, but      before they have softened. Freeze and thaw and they will      soften so you can juice them.    </p>    <p>      • Never boil with the seeds in. While American      highbush cranberries may look and taste like cranberries,      they do not have the small seeds of real cranberries, but a      large single seed. The seed is very bitter and should be      removed from the berry before cooking. Remove all stems      before crushing or pressing.    </p>    <p>      • For a cleaner, prettier and better-flavored juice,      let the juice settle in the refrigerator a few days. Then      siphon or pour off the top juice. discarding the sludge      that settles to the bottom.    </p>    <p>      SAM THAYER<br />      Wild Foods Institute<br />      Port Wing, Wisconsin    </p>    <p>      <em>If you would like to grow your own true, great tasting      native Viburnum edule, you can order from the following      company:</em>    </p>    <p>      <br />      <em>Fraser's Thimble Farms<br /></em> <em>175 Arbutus      Road<br /></em> <em>Salt Spring Island, BC V8K      1A3<br /></em> <em>Canada<br /></em> <em>(250)      537-5788<br /></em> www.thimblefarms.com    </p>
