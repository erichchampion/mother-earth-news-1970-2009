                    <h5 id="byline">      By Tracy Gilsvik    </h5>        <p>      <strong>They manage brush<br /> and weeds while<br /> occasionally looking<br />      adorable.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sheep and goats are being used for brush control all across      the continent. Sheep keep grass and many weeds closely      trimmed, while goats prefer shrubs and brush - even dining      readily on poison ivy. In California's Angeles National      Forest a herd of 6,000 sheep keep 13,000 acres of ridgetop      firebreaks free from inflammable brush. In Alberta, Canada,      the Ministry of Environmental Protection uses sheep to      control brush in native elk habitat. Grazing sheep have      cleared land under power lines in New Hampshire and      maintain the Civil War battlefields of Virginia. In more      commercial endeavors, goats and sheep are being rented out      as natural, nontoxic alternatives to herbicides and      gas-powered mowers.    </p>        <p>      Using these creatures eliminates the use of toxic      pesticides,. gasoline, and the manpower and machinery      normally used to clear weeds and brush.    </p>        <p>      I decided to try using sheep and goats in my own back yard      and learned the hard way that goats can be destructive to      fruit trees and a challenge to contain with a fence. (Once,      one of our goats even pushed open the back door and let      himself into the house.) But now that we have proper      fencing and shelter and have learned how to care for these      creatures, we have few surprises. Our goats, Snapper and      Toro, and the sheep, Thelma and Louise, have maintained our      old pasture, which had been overgrown with willow, alder,      poplar, raspberry bushes and other weeds. They eat      everything but the alder. Now they get to come into the      yard and do some more work there. Their job is to eat, and      they're good at it. We rarely have to mow.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Story</em> <em>and photos by Tracy Gilsvik</em>    </p>
