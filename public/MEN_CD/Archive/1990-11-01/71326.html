                    <p>      THERE IS AN ever-continuing argument among pomologists      about the best time to prune fruit trees. Each professional      orchardist and experienced home grower has a favorite time.      Meanwhile, beginners can get completely confused when      exposed to the many sides of the controversy.    </p>    <p>      Since seasonal conditions vary greatly throughout the      country, your location is an important factor in      determining just when you should prune.    </p>    <h3>Late Fall and Winter</h3>    <p>      Late fall or winter are favorite times to prune in warmer      areas. Orchardists have more spare time then, and the trees      are bare, making it easier to see what needs to be done.      You should choose days when the temperature is above      freezing, however, to avoid injury to the wood. Frozen wood      is very brittle; it breaks easily when hit by a ladder or      pruning tool.    </p>    <p>      If you live in a cold part of the country, or if you are      growing tree varieties that are inclined to suffer winter      injury, wait until the coldest weather is over before      pruning.    </p>    <h3>Late Winter</h3>    <p>      This season is probably the most popular time for northern      gardeners to prune. As in late fall and winter, the tree is      completely dormant, and since the leaves are off, it is      easy to see where to make the cuts. By waiting until late      winter, you can repair any injuries caused by harsh      weather. Also, the temperature is usually warm enough      during the day to prune without injuring the wood, and most      orchardists are still not too busy during this season.    </p>    <p>      If you prune your trees regularly each year and therefore      don't have to remove large amounts of wood, late winter is      a satisfactory time to prune. However, if your trees have      been neglected for a few years and are badly in need of a      cutback, late winter is not the best time to prune.      Excessive pruning in the winter usually stimulates a great      deal of growth the following spring and summer, because the      tree tries to replace its lost wood. Branches, suckers and      water sprouts are likely to grow in abundance. If a major      pruning job is necessary, do all or at least a large part      of it in late summer or early fall so you won't cause an      excessive amount of regrowth.    </p>
