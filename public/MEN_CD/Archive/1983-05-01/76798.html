        <strong>THE</strong><strong>PUBLIC IS WILLING TO PAY FOR A CLEANER ENVIRONMENT:</strong> In a survey recently conducted by Continental Group, Inc. (a forest products company whose enterprise is regulated by environmental laws), 60% of the 1,300 respondents indicated that they would pay more for products and services in order to clean up the environment. Furthermore, in that same nationwide study, two-thirds of the 263 business executives polled said that they want the environment protected . . . even if doing so results in a slowdown in economic growth.<br /><br /><strong>GIANT NIGHT LIGHTS:</strong> Two NASA scientists are suggesting that huge solar mirrors (launched by space shuttles and then locked into orbit around the earth) could, in the future, actually illuminate our nighttime skies . . . conserving energy and aiding cities stricken with blackouts. The light from 16 half-mile-wide mirrors would-according to the proposal-be controlled by computers . . . but the effects of such a system on animals and plants is being questioned, and a study has been recommended.<br /><br /><strong>MOST DANGEROUS WOOD TOOL:</strong> The table saw holds the dubious honor of being the most dangerous tool a woodworker is likely to have in his or her shop. Preliminary results of a survey by Fine Woodworking magazine show that 44% of all severe hand injuries reported by the woodcrafters occurred at the table saw. Haste, fatigue, and inexperience were the reasons given for most of the mishaps . . . but a number of the survey's respondents did admit to being injured while trying to get away with what they knew to be hazardous operating techniques.<br /><br /><strong>CHEMICALS RESPONSIBLE FOR UNPRODUCTIVE GULLS:</strong> Back in 1977, when two California biologists reported that unusual mating practices had been observed among western seagulls on Santa Barbara Island, the phenomenon was attributed to a shortage of male gulls. Now, it appears the birds' behavior may be one more example of man's fumbling hands upsetting the delicate balance of nature. Reports from the University of California show that the pesticide DDT produces "estrogen-like residues", which have rendered some male western gulls incapable of breeding . . . causing, in turn, females to sit on unfertilized eggs.<br /><br /><strong>COMPUTERS CUT POWER COSTS:</strong> To qualify for lower electric rates, some farmers have fitted their irrigation systems with automatic cutoff switches that stop the water flow when a signal indicates a local power demand peak. USDA scientists have now developed a program that will allow a computer to intercept that signal . . . determine which fields can best go without the water . . . and then send the cutoff cue accordingly. In addition, the computer automatically receives a report on weather conditions from each field every 15 minutes. Finally, the system includes a manual override . . . just in case a farmer decides to irrigate a crop other than the one the computer picks.<br /><br /><strong>ANT-I-ARTHRITIS</strong>: Bolivian Indians have long used the very painful sting of a local ant to alleviate the symptoms of arthritis. Now, researchers at the University of Miami are injecting the insect's venom into patients . . . and report that two- to three-year remissions can result. The medicine is currently awaiting approval from the U. S. Food and Drug Administration.<br /><br /><strong>PRICE OF PACKAGING:</strong> If your weekly grocery bill has you upset, you may get downright angry when you see how little of that money actually goes toward edibles. In the U.S., an enormously high proportion of "food" costs really pays for packaging. In 1977, for instance, the packaging for distilled spirits and canned fruits and vegetables totaled 101% of the food ingredient costs . . . while for cookies and crackers it was 86% . . . and for flavorings it was 74%. Of course, these are only averages, and some items have containers that cost five times as much as does the food that's in them.<br /><br /><strong>OIL SPILLS DECREASE:</strong> A report by the International Tanker Owners' Pollution Federation shows a dramatic decline in the number of large oil spills between 1979 and 1982. In 1979 there were 37 spills of more than 5,000 gallons each . . . in 1980 that number dropped to 12 . . . and, in 1981, only 4 large oil spills occurred. It's believed that the reduction in the volume of oil transported during this period, and stricter antipollution laws, contributed to the decline.<br /><br /><strong>3,000 OPINIONS</strong>: Last summer 300 independent video producers interviewed over 3,000 people at public places and events and recorded a 60-second-or-less statement on disarmament from each. The 30-plus hours of these tapesfilmed at locations varying from Chicago to Sao Paulo-have been shown on TV marathons, at the Kennedy Center, and in bus terminals. A half-hour version of the survey (showing a variety of opinions) is available for $40 (covering transfer and stock) from Downtown Community Television, Dept. TMEN, 87 Lafayette Street, New York, New York 10013. Indicate video format (VHS, Beta 1 or 2, or 3/4" Umatic) when ordering. According to the international coalition Mobilization for Animals, <strong>EVERY SECOND, THREE ANIMALS DIE IN AMERICAN LABORATORIES</strong>.... In 1982 the reported occurrence of <strong>MEASLES REACHED ITS LOWEST LEVEL</strong> since national reporting of the disease began in 1912 . . . . Over the past three years, <strong>GLOBAL BARTER HAS ACCOUNTED FOR 25-30% OF WORLD TRADE</strong>.... There's evidence that a naturally occurring chemical in <strong>COTTONSEED OIL MAY FIGHT VENEREAL DISEASES</strong>.... And your summer vacation plans can likely benefit from the new <strong>VISITOR'S GUIDE TO THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE REFUGES</strong>, available for $2.25 from the Superintendent of Documents, Dept. TMEN, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402 (specify stock No. 024-010-00529-7).
