        <p> I've always enjoyed almost everything about camping <em>. . . except</em> having to tote a cumbersome pack on my back! In fact, the mere <em>thought of</em> one <em>of</em> those aluminum-tubed nylon muscle strainers-stuffed, as usual, with my favorite backpacking luxuries . . . like a bottle <em>of</em> wine, a cast-iron pan, or a bag <em>of</em> fresh oranges-really used to put a damper on my enthusiasm for taking to the trails.</p><p>Once, in an attempt to lighten my pack, my husband and I loaded our faithful yellow dog with the small amount <em>of</em> gear we felt she could handle. The pooch did fine, too . . . un til we got to the woods and she proceeded to lie down in every stream we came across (leaving us with soggy matches and rapidly "rehydrating" dehydrated soup)!</p><p>After that fiasco, we began to consider the possibility <em>of</em> purchasing a "low-maintenance" beast <em>of</em> burden that wouldn't be prone to cooling of in creeks. And, since we figured a horse or mule would cost too much to feed, we eventually decided to investigate the practicality of purchasing a <em>donkey.</em> The long eared critters were-we were told-supposed to have terrific endurance . . . good trail sense . . . the ability to handle reasonably heavy loads . . . and excellent dispositions, to boot.</p><p>All things considered, therefore, it seemed that a burro might be <em>perfect</em> for us . . . except that there was still a lot we didn't <em>know</em> about this "desert dweller". For example, where-in our northwestern state <em>of</em> Montana -could we even <em>locate</em> one <em>of</em> the beasts? And then, when we did come across a donkey, could we be sure it'd be able to withstand our harsh winters? Well, after a little more research and a lot <em>of</em> looking, we did finally manage to find a burro . . . and (I'm pleased to say) it not only survives our sub-zero weather <em>and</em> lives up to all our expectations, but it's as easy to keep around the farm as it is helpful on our camping ventures!</p><h3>BACK UP A BIT</h3><p>Actually, finding our beast <em>of</em> burden wasn't all that hard, once we got on the right track. At first-not knowing where else to look-we ransacked the local library for information . . . talked to some <em>of</em> the horse dealers in our area . . . and even let our friends know about our search in hopes that they could help. However, we didn't turn up much <em>of</em> value until we contacted the American Donkey and Mule Society (write, addressing your letter to the attention of Betsy Hutchins at Dept. TMEN, Route 5, Box 65, Denton, Texas 76201). The folks there sent us a list of burro breeders across the country, and a catalog of all the publications their organization has to offer.</p><p>Finally, after carefully studying the tips on how to purchase a donkey (in the society's book, <em>The Donkey and Mule as a Backyard Hobby),</em> we felt we were ready to do some educated shopping on our own. In no time we found and bought a two-year-old, standard sized about 48 inches from the ground to the top <em>of</em> the shoulders or withers-female burro (jenny or jennet). She was friendly but green (untrained), and cost less than $100.</p><p>Though we <em>did</em> have some problems with her at first, we realized that an unschooled youngster was bound to have a <em>few</em> bad habits. At any rate, we <em>were</em> prepared when she balked at being loaded into our truck . . . but when she lay down halfway up the ramp-forcing four <em>of</em> us to <em>push her</em> the rest <em>of</em> the way-we had a few moments <em>of</em> doubt about the wisdom <em>of</em> our new purchase!</p><h3>PROPER SCHOOLING</h3><p>However, once we got her home, our misgivings quickly disappeared . . . because we discovered that-contrary to what some people may think-donkeys are not ornery <em>or</em> stubborn unless they're "taught" to be so through abuse or neglect. In fact, they're exceptionally bright and, when treated firmly but with kindness and respect, they can be very loving and obedient. After she got used to us and to her new surroundings, our jenny responded to our book-learned training techniques like a straight A student. At the end <em>of</em> a summer <em>of</em> daily lessons, she knew how to lead . . . ford streams . . . cross rickety bridges ... and walk on pavement without the slightest hesitation! (She <em>still</em> doesn't like getting into the truck . . . but we're working on that!)<br /><br />While the burro's education was under way, my husband and I went ahead and purchased all the pack equipment we thought we'd need. We were advised, by experienced pack trippers, to buy the best gear we could afford, so we ended up spending $175 . . . on a good sawbuck saddle and pad, a sturdy halter, and a well-made pair of panniers.</p><p>And, by the following summer, our diligent little student was ready for her final examination . . . which she passed with flying colors! Not only could she carry close to 70 pounds as easily as I could tote a 5-pound daypack, but she rarely shied or balked at anything (even a bird flushing out of the underbrush near her feet failed to excite the jenny). In short, she was a champ on the trail.</p><h3>AT HOME</h3><p>We've since discovered that caring for our cheerful camping mate is just as easy when she's on our farm. During the warmer months, we give her the run of a three-acre pasture (which she's more than happy to share with a cow or a horse, if asked to). And, when the weather turns cold, we put her up at night in a cozy donkey-sized stall. Her feed consists of a few sections of hay a day plus a couple of cups of grain or pellets on exceptionally chilly nights. Other than that, we simply see to it that she's wormed and vaccinated in the fall and that she has her hoofs trimmed three times a year by a farrier.</p><p>All in all, aside from a few minor-and even somewhat amusing-quirks . . . such as her ability to nudge open the pasture gate with her nose, and her adamant intolerance of dogs (which she'll put up with on the trail only if they travel well in front to allow her to keep an eye on them!), our jenny is a delight to have around. And her continued willingness to take the weight off my shoulders (on the trails) has endeared the burro to my backpacking heart forever!</p><h3><em>How To Know A Good Pack Mate When You See One</em> </h3><p><em>First and foremost,</em> you <em>need</em> to examine closely <em>the personality of any donkey you</em> might <em>consider purchasing. Keep in mind, too,</em> that <em>sex and age</em> will each have <em>a</em> lotto <em>do</em> with <em>a</em> burro's temperament. For <em>instance, females and gelded males</em> tend to be gentler <em>than jacks . . . and</em> young'uns are usually more <em>trainable (and more highly-spiritedly than adult animals of about five years or</em> more.</p><p><em>Next, look at the</em> burro's conformation. <em>Are its legs</em> straight? <em>What</em> about its <em>body</em>. . . is it compact and sturdy? <em>(Donkeys</em> aren't <em>as</em> muscular as <em>horses or</em> mules, so <em>don't be put off by relatively thin chests and haunches.) Then</em> ask <em>the</em> animal's <em>owner to lead it around at a</em> walk and a <em>trot, so you</em> can <em>determine whether its</em> gaits are fairly <em>even and relaxed.</em> </p><p><em>Now, if</em> you're <em>happy with the burro's</em> <em>personality</em> <em>and the way it</em> looks <em>and</em> moves, <em>the next step is to evaluate its health. (You might want to ask a vet</em> or <em>a</em> farrier <em>to examine</em> any animal that you <em>feel is</em> in questionable <em>condition.) Determine whether the coatis thick, or mangy. And,</em> <em>if</em> <em>it is on the scruffy</em> <em>s</em> <em>ide, find</em> out by asking <em>the owner</em> <em>(if</em> <em>you</em> can't tell) <em>whether the</em> condition is due to <em>worms or lice . . . or, perhaps, is</em> just a result of <em>the animal's</em> shedding its winter coat. Once that's taken care <em>of, check the donkey's eyes.</em> <em>They should be bright and alert</em> with no signs <em>of infection and/or mucus. Also be</em> sure there's <em>no unnatural discharge from the ears or the</em> genital <em>area . . . and that</em> there are no swellings or unattended cuts anywhere <em>(examine the head, under the jaw,</em> along <em>the legs, and so forth).</em> </p><p><em>Finally, and likely most important, care</em> <em>fully</em> <em>examine the beast's hoofs. They need to be both</em> tough and <em>pliable . . . not dried</em> out <em>and brittle (which might signal a vitamin</em> deficiency). <em>Keep</em> in <em>mind, though, that over</em> grown hoofs can <em>be</em> easily <em>corrected . . , as</em> can <em>thrush (a</em> fungus that develops in the frog <em>of the foot</em> <em>if</em> an animal <em>is left standing too long on soggy terrain). However,</em> <em>if</em> <em>a burro</em> shows <em>any signs of</em> founder <em>(in which case the soles of the</em> feet will appear <em>dropped, and the animal</em> will walk as <em>if treading on eggs), you'd better</em> forget that critter, <em>because the illness could render it permanently unsound.</em> </p>
