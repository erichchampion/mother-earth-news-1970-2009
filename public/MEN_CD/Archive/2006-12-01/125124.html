        Now improving the energy efficiency of your home not only lowersyour energy bills every month but pays off at tax time too! TheEnergy Policy Act of 2005 allows homeowners to claim a tax creditof up to $500 in 2006 and 2007 for home energy efficiencyimprovements.<br /><br />For existing homes, the tax credit is 10 percent of the final costof qualified energy efficient products for a maximum of $500.<br /><br />Adding insulation to your home is one of the easiest ways to savemoney on your utility bills and qualify you for the energy taxdeduction, according to the <a href="http://www.naima.org/" target="_blank">North American Insulation ManufacturersAssociation</a> (NAIMA). Improved levels of insulation alsoincrease comfort and make other energy efficiency improvements payoff faster.<br /><br />You should keep your receipts when you purchase the insulation andother energy efficient products that qualify for the tax credit.You also need to get a certification statement from the insulationmanufacturer clarifying that the insulation product installedactually qualifies for the tax credit. For the contingencies ofqualifying for the tax credit, check the<a href="http://www.irs.gov/newsroom/article/0,,id=153397,00.html" target="_blank">IRS guidelines</a>.<br /><br />For more information on energy efficiency, read<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Alternative_Energy/2006_August_September/Get_Cash_Back_for_Energy_Improvements_Green_Gazette" target="_blank">Get Cash Back for Energy Improvements</a> from   the August/September 2006 issue of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>, visit   <a href="http://www.energytaxincentives.org" target="_blank">The   Tax Incentives Assistance Project</a> site, or read   <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green_Home_Building/2002_December_January/All_About_Insulation" target="_blank">All About Insulation</a> from the   December/January 2002 issue of <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.
