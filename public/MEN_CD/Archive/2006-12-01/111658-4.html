        <p>Tomato plants grow best if given some sort of support, Kennedy says. Fruit growing off the ground ripens sooner, is easier to pick and cleaner than its ground-grown counterparts. Some gardeners tie stems to stakes with strips of pantyhose, or you can weave stems in and out of wire fencing. Limit staked and fence-grown tomatoes to two or three stems.</p><p>Kennedy says the simplest supports for growing tomatoes are homemade cylindrical cages fashioned from concrete-reinforcing wire. The generous-sized grid allows easy access for picking ripe fruit. A 60-inch length with a 6-inch grid makes a cage about 20 inches in diameter; its 5-foot height can support even the most vigorous vine.</p>
