                    <p>      <em>The best way to incorporate thermal mass in a passive      solar house may well be to...</em></p>      <h5 id="byline">by David Bainbridge</h5>			<p>      In many ways, <em>passive</em> solar homes are superior to      those with <em>active</em> (mechanically assisted) heating      and cooling systems. After all, passive solar systems don't      rely on auxiliary energy sources to perform (so they'll      work even when the power is off) . . . are generally simple      and low in cost . . . combine energy collection and storage      functions . . . have a long life . . . need little      maintenance . . . and can often be built and installed by      the home handy person, without special training or      equipment.<br />      <br />      But precisely because such "non-moving" systems have no      pumps or controls to circulate warm or cool air, they      typically rely on one key element: the <em>thermal      mass</em> that stores and gives off absorbed heat or cold.      A number of different items can be used to provide this      energy-holding capacity, but just about the most effective      and economical "To a water wall term that is a shorthand      way of saying "contained water for thermal mass in passive      solar homes").<br />      <br />      Water-wall systems deserve much greater recognition than      they've yet received . . . for a number of reasons. First,      they can be very economical, especially since such units      can often be installed-in either new or retrofitted      homes-with standard construction techniques. Second, they      are effective for both heating <em>and</em> cooling,      particularly in areas with low nighttime temperatures.      (Some heat-storage mediums, such as phase change salts,      don't work for cooling.) Third, water walls can be      attractively accented or practically invisible, as desired.      (Did you <em>notice</em> the water walls when you glanced      at the photos?) Fourth, water is a more efficient storage      medium than are the other common sources of thermal mass.      (See Table I for a comparison of water, concrete, and      phase-change salts.) Consequently, water walls take up less      room than other storage systems. This allows the house to      offer outside views-avoiding the claustrophobic sensations      possible with full masonry (Trombe) walls, which often      completely block off south windows-and permits the easy      installation and operation of movable window insulation.      And finally, the fine radiating and temperature moderating      qualities of water walls make for very comfortable homes.    </p>                <p>      <strong>START WITH</strong> <strong>THE (SOLAR) BASICS. .      .</strong><br />      <br />      Building a water-wall structure can actually be a      straightforward proposition. To begin with, the home should      incorporate the basics of good passive solar design. The      most obvious of these fundamentals is proper orientation: A      major wall should face south. Likewise, most windows should      be on the south, with some on the north . . . but      comparatively few on the east and west. The dwelling should      also have excellent insulation (a minimum of R-19 in the      walls and R-30 in the ceiling) and weather stripping      (infiltration can easily account for one half of the heat      loss in a well-insulated but poorly weatherized building).      The design should incorporate good summer shading, too . .      . particularly on any east and west windows, which, if      unshielded, can let in a surprising amount of the summer      sun's radiation. Then again, the dwelling needs adequate      natural, induced, or mechanical ventilation. And last, it      needs double- or tripe-pane windows with some form of      movable insulation . . . either thermal shutters or      drapes.<br />      <br />      If you construct a conventional house with these passive      features <em>and</em> a water wall, the building should      achieve very good thermal performance. The results of a      study conducted for the California Energy Commission-shown      in Table 2-document the performance of <em>standard</em>      tract houses with water walls. And if the homes had the      insu-levels recommended <em>above they</em><br />      <br />      would perform considerably better. _111 tact, my experience      in Davis, California suggests that these calculations are      even conservative, as water-wall dwellings there-without      movable insulation on the windows-have met 80% of their own      heating needs and have provided full cooling. Similar or      better performance could be achieved in most of the growth      (Sunbelt) regions of the United States .<br />      <br />      <strong>. . . THEN ADD WATER</strong><br />      <br />      To figure out how much water storage a home needs, you      first need to calculate its glazing requirements. The      amount of south glass necessary for heating a passive solar      house can be estimated from the anticipated climatic      conditions, available sunshine, and the design and      configuration of the building. As a rule of thumb, a      well-insulated house should have an amount of south window      area equivalent to 10% of the dwelling's floor space (a      less heat-tight retrofit might need a glazing to- floor      ratio of I to 4). From there, you can calculate how much      water you'll need by allowing three to six gallons of      liquid (four to eight in a retrofit) per square foot of      south facing glass.<br />      <br />      The configuration and placement of the water containers can      be varied to suit a wide range of cases and functions.      They'll work best for heating if they're placed directly in      front of a south window and can absorb the maximum amount      of sunlight. On the other hand, water walls best promote      cooling if they're placed in a spot with good air      flow.<br />      <br />      And what should you use to store all this liquid? Well,      while sealed culverts, 55-gallon drums, plastic jugs, large      fiberglass tubes, and other containers have been used, my      favorite option is the use of custom built modular steel      water tanks. These containers are certainly the most      attractive means for providing thermal storage. They're      strong, durable, and relatively easy to make (see the      accompanying illustration), and they're not difficult to      install in most new or retrofitted solar houses (although      extra floor bracing may be required if they're set on a      suspended floor). In fact, the tanks can serve as window      seats or counters, or be integrated into the basic house      plan.<br />      <br />      There are, I think, some specific advantages to working      with smaller metal tanks, measuring about 1-112' X 2' X 6'.      They're easy to handle, install, and-if need be drain and      move. Since their weight can be distributed more evenly      than that of "concentrated" large containers, they may not      need as much bracing. They're also unobtrusive, and fit      well into the house design.<br />      <br />      Larger steel tanks, however, can also be used effectively.      They are less expensive to build (running as little as 50d      per gallon) . . . but, of course, they cost more to      install. Often these larger tanks are used as a wall      between south rooms, on the north side of a south room, or      between a greenhouse and the main structure.<br />      <br />      Whether you use large or small tanks, if their primary      purpose is storing solar heat, they should be set where      they receive the maximum amount of sunlight. The sides      exposed to the sun should be painted black (surfaces facing      the home's interior can be any color). You'll also want to      set the tanks back from the windows a bit so you can easily      install and remove nighttime window insulation.<br />      <br />      Modular steel water containers can provide benefits other      than simple passive solar heating. They can be set near a      wood stove to help moderate its heat production. They      exchange heat rapidly for quick nighttime cooling by      natural or forced ventilation. And they can be coupled with      an active solar system for augmented heating or      cooling.<br />      <br />      But that's not all. Water-wall vessels also provide an      excellent emergency source of water for fighting fires      (you'll probably need an auxiliary pump to help with this)      and, if the liquid has been treated properly, an emergency      source of drinking water.<br />      <br />      To prevent corrosion and leaks, pressure test any tank      before installing it, and use chemical antirust additives .      . . sacrificial anodes similar to those used in water      heaters . . . or interior zinc chromate, lead primer, or      epoxy coatings. A specially formulated, <em>potable</em>      antirust treatment called Aqua Clear is also      available.<br />      <br />      Better still, all of these worthwhile functions come at a      very economical price. The cost of a house with such a      space conditioning system is only $300 to $600 more than      that of a conventional dwelling. (Actually, in California,      thanks- to the state's solar tax credit, the house would      cost $500 to $800 <em>less</em> than one with a      conventional mechanical heating/cooling system.) Such      initial expense would be paid back in a few years in      reduced heating bills.<br />      <br />      <strong>A BEAUTIFUL</strong> <strong>WATER-WALL      HOME</strong><br />      <br />      An excellent contemporary example of a water-wall home is      the 1,750-square-foot Morgan house. This beautiful $85,000      residence in Davis, California ends, once and for all, the      rumor that a solar dwelling can't look good and still work      well.    </p>        <p>      Brock Wag staff was the architect of this three-bedroom,      two-bath, custom-designed abode. His clients wanted an      attractive open home with a solar greenhouse. They got that      . . . plus a very comfortable dwelling that has 100%      natural cooling (in a part of California where summer      temperatures can exceed 110 °F) and 80%-plus natural      heating (in a 2,814-degree-day climate).<br />      <br />      The house includes virtually all of the elements of good      passive solar design (although the ceiling insulation was      limited to six-inch bats--giving it a value of R- 19-by the      depth of the rafters in the cathedral ceiling). Solar gain      is through 180 square feet of south glass on the ground      level and second story. Thermal storage is provided in the      form of the 26,000-pound, tile-covered, insulated concrete      slab and four steel water tanks (which hold a total of      14,000 pounds of liquid). Two of these are 2' X 2' X 5'      sitting benches in the living room . . . one-in the den-is      counter high, 2' X 2-1/2' X 11' . . . and a wall-sized 2' X      8' X 8' tank sits against the north side of the dwelling      under the second-story balcony. Total storage capacity is      almost 400,000 Btu, which provides carryover for several      days of heating or cooling.<br />      <br />      Summer cooling is also aided by effective control of solar      gain, by way of wide overhangs and an arbor over the south      deck. Night air circulation-assisted by the north south      window orientation and open floor plan-is provided by both      cross and stack ventilation. And a Casablanca fan produces      extra cooling on the few days when the interior temperature      reaches the high 70's.<br />      <br />      The home's hot water-naturally-is also solar heated, by a      two-panel thermosiphon system with a storage tank on the      second floor. (The backup water- and space-heating systems      are gas.)<br />      <br />      The Morgan residence is located in Village Homes, a      200-unit solar development. Built in 1981, it represents      the culminating step in an evolution of solar designs begun      over seven years ago with the first units in Village Homes.      And, in my opinion, it stands as irrevocable proof that      passive solar design is the best way to beat high energy      prices . . . with water walls leading the way.<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Portions of this article were excerpted      from David Bainbridge's. not yet available</em> The Water      Wall Solar Home Book.<br />      <br />      <em>David is a noted author and consultant on solar energy.
