                    <p>      <em>In issue 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of humankind's better ideas barter-and made      an interesting suggestion: "1'd like to see a continuing      feature on barter and skill-and labor exchanges, " said      Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for      contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied .      . . and announced our still-standing offer: Send us a short      account of an actual barter (write Successful Swaps, THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>°, 105 Stoney Mountain Road      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791), and if we print it      in this column, you'll receive a 12month subscription (new      or extended) to</em> <em>MOTHER.</em><br />      <br />      I really wanted to do something special for my wife Kim      last Christmas. You see, for the preceding five years we'd      lived first in a small trailer, and then in a 16' X 16'      camp, as we worked toward building our own large stack wall      home. So I had my heart set on giving her something that      would-in effect-let her know that we'd soon have more space      and comfort.<br />      <br />      When I was young, my family moved to a small house, and had      to give up a massive maple table <em>of</em> 1800 vintage      that had five pillar legs and enough extra leaves to      comfortably seat a dozen people. I knew who <em>owned</em>      the table, but I couldn't afford to buy it.<br />      <br />      First, I offered to buck, split, and pile several cords      <em>of</em> wood in exchange for the piece of heirloom      furniture, but the owner turned me down . . . since she      could handle those particular chores herself. However, she      did have a wide range <em>of</em> odd jobs that needed      doing, so we agreed to swap my completion <em>of</em> those      tasks for the table.<br />      <br />      My brother and cousin helped me, and in one day we renailed      and tarred the roof, reinforced and waterproofed a leaking      back porch, cleaned the stovepipes and chimney, recaulked      the chimney flashing, checked and adjusted attic      insulation, and rebuilt and hung an exterior door.<br />      <br />      Kim was surprised and delighted with the family table our      bartering had provided, and she plans to keep it always      open to company . . . once the stackwall has room for      it!<br />      <br />      <strong>B.P.</strong> <strong>,Ontario,      Canada</strong><br />      <br />      Although I'd been scrimping and saving for a year to buy      the necessary tools and supplies to start my own      custom-made jewelry business, I had yet to acquire one      <em>of</em> the most needed <em>and</em> expensive items on      my equipment list . . . the electroplating rectifier. I had      come across a set <em>of</em> plans for one, but didn't      have the electrical know how to complete them.<br />      <br />      Then I happened to mention my situation to a friend who      immediately reminded me that her husband is an electronics      technician. He was willing to build the rectifier,      and-since Christmas was right around the corner and he      didn't have a present for his wife-we were able to work out      a swap of our respective skills.<br />      <br />      I bought the parts (which cost $13.65) required for      construction . . . and my friend supplied the gold (from a      ring he no longer wore) for the one-of-a-kind ring that I      designed and cast for his wife!<br />      <br />      <strong>T.J.M.</strong> <strong>, Arkansas</strong><br />      <br />      My experiences with barter have led to what I hope will be      the ultimate trade for me and my family . . . one that will      allow us to relocate to a rural area.<br />      <br />      My first swap occurred when a handyman neighbor admired my      strawberry patch, and I agreed to prepare a similar bed on      his land using my compost, worms, and transplants. The      result was a beautiful 10' X 10' starting bed that was      expanded to 15' X 15' the next year. In return, he used his      welding skill to build me a two-wheel dolly from scrap      steel (it's strong enough to move a large freezer)      <em>and</em> two wagons for my children.<br />      <br />      Since then I've traded tilling for produce . . . worked out      a hardcover science fiction book exchange among a growing      circle of people . . . instructed my dentist and his wife      in a series of outdoor survival skills (rock climbing,      foraging, trapping small game, improvising shelters, and      such) in exchange for two years <em>of</em> dental work for      my family . . . and swapped child-/house-sitting with      neighbors for a new bow and quiver.<br />      <br />      I've had many years <em>of</em> experience as a certified      mid-level medical practitioner (paramedic, military medic,      and I recently graduated from a physician's assistant      program), so now I'm trying to arrange land and housing in      exchange for my providing primary and emergency health care      (combining conventional Western medicine and wholistic      health-care practices). Several small communities that are      medically under serviced are interested in my proposal, and      I hope to complete a "deal" soon.<br />      <br />      <strong>H.J.O.,California</strong><br />      <br />      When I was laid off last year, I managed to keep my head      above water by making and selling storage boxes built out      <em>of</em> old pallet lumber. One day a satisfied box      customer came by and asked me to repair her porch, and-even      though she told me it would be a month or so before she      could pay me-I agreed to go ahead and do the work, again      using my scrap pallet lumber.<br />      <br />      After I'd finished the job, she asked me in for a cup of      coffee . . . and it was then that I spied a stack of old      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>° magazines. She agreed to trade      the magazines for the repairs, and you can imagine my      happiness when I got home and discovered that I now owned      issues 1-66!<br />      <br />      Since then, I've traded more time and labor for other books      and tools. But that first swap was the best, because I now      use my scrap pallet lumber for a number of projects found      in my back issues of MOTHER.<br />      <br />      <strong>R.P.,Oregon</strong><br />      <br />      As a single, working parent of two teenagers (one a college      student and one in junior high), I'm always looking for odd      jobs to supplement my income. Therefore, I didn't hesitate      to take on weekly bookkeeping for a friend who runs a      delivery service and also sells bees and beekeeping      supplies.<br />      <br />      And, as Christmas drew near, I realized that I had a      perfect opportunity to give my dad something he'd always      wanted ... bees! My friend and I agreed to barter my      accounting skill, plus some help with deliveries, for a      complete beekeeping outfit. We boxed up the equipment: a      how-to book, gloves, a smoker, a hat and net, a hive tool,      and a honey cookbook for my mom . . . then I added a poem      that promised delivery of the bees in spring.<br />      <br />      Best of all, Dad was <em>doubly</em> delighted when he      heard about the deal . . . since he's always been a bit of      a horse trader himself!<br />      <br />      <strong>P.S., Arkansas</strong><br />      <br />      Since my family is planning a move from the city to a more      self-sufficient environment within the next few years, I      decided to learn something about canning and preserving      food. However, I was appalled at the high price of      supermarket produce (imagine the cost of buying a couple of      bushels of peaches at your local store!) and was further      intimidated when I tallied up the numbers of canning jars      and supplies that I'd need just to get started.<br />      <br />      By chance, I mentioned my predicament to a bachelor friend      who has a small backyard orchard (about 15 trees) of      various fruits that he'd been giving away-and even      composting for lack of knowledge on how to preserve them.      He'd also been picking up canning jars at garage sales and      flea markets for several years in anticipation of doing      something with his harvests.<br />      <br />      So we made this happy arrangement: I'd pick the fruit as it      ripened, and can it . . . he would provide the jars, sugar,      and honey . . . and I'd keep half of what I preserved,      returning "my" jars to him as they were emptied.<br />      <br />      I gained valuable canning experience . . . learned to dry      fruits and make fruit purees and leathers . . . and ended      up with dozens of quarts of organically grown,      exceptionally tasty canned food. In return, my friend was      finally able to realize the full benefit of his orcharding      efforts. It was such a satisfactory swap that we plan to do      it again next year.<br />      <br />      <strong>A.E.</strong> <strong>,California</strong>    </p>
