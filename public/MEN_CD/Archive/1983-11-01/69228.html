                    <hr />    <p>      'T was the week before Christmas./I dreamed of a home,/A      house made of gingerbread /Shaped like a dome.</p>			<h5 id="byline">by Kathy Kellogg</h5>			<p>      There's something special about those seven days before      Christmas. Maybe it's the holiday magic in the air or just      having the children home on vacation. At any rate, we      always get the urge to undertake some memorable family      project during that preYule week. And this past year, it      involved constructing a gingerbread house . . . but not      your run-of-themill, four-walls-and-a-roof variety. Oh, no!      It had to be very, very special . . . a dome-a miniature      replica of our dream home-made of cookies, candy, and lots      of love!<br />      <br />      Building this dream, however, wasn't as easy as we had      first imagined. Before we could even whip up a batch of      gingerbread, it was necessary to research dome      construction, make patterns and models, and prepare a      stepby-step building plan.    </p>            			<p>      <strong>DOME ARCHITECTURE</strong><br />      <br />      I soon found myself with every dome building book our local      library had to offer, boggled down in terms such as      trapezoidal icositetrahedron, hexakis octahedron, and      triakis icosahedion. Angles, strut lengths, and complicated      mathematical computations added to the confusion.      Fortunately, I soon discovered that domehome basics aren't      nearly so mystifying as some books would lead you to      believe. Geodesic structures are simply strong, light,      convexly curved buildings approximating spheres or      half-spheres. <em>(Geodesic</em> is a mathematician's term      for the shortest distance between two points on the surface      of a sphere.) The dome's surfaces are strong, because-like      a set of interlocking arches each supports the others. When      the basic units triangles attached in five-part      (pentagonal) or six-part (hexagonal) sections are hooked      together, the result is a simple, symmetric shape that      needs little in the way of additional supports such as      beams or columns. And because this type of dome is made of      many identical parts (of which the majority are      triangular), it's very well suited W for mass construction      . . . and for ginger' bread houses.<br />      <br />      The version we chose was a modified dome structure-adapted      from plans in a li brary book-with hexagonal sections, top      spacers, bottom risers and spacers, and rectangular doorway      and window pieces (see the illustration). I estimated that      the gingerbread version would be about one-tenth the size      of the house in the plans, so I developed a pattern by      dividing by ten all the measurements given in the      book.<br />      <br />      Next, I cut pattern pieces from lightweight cardboard (old      file folders), and taped them together to make a model.      This was an invaluable aid in visualizing the actual      angles, shapes, and three-dimensional relationships.    </p>            <p>      <strong>THE PRELIMINARIES</strong><br />      <br />      After the model met with my family's approval (and I took a      bow for my architectural talent), we decided to make a      cardboard frame . . . which would function like the struts      of a full-sized dome, add durability, and greatly simplify      the construction.<br />      <br />      For this project, we employed heavier material (the back of      a paper tablet) and used the pattern to mark out the pieces      . . . except that this time we trimmed out and discarded      the center of each one (leaving a 1/2" to 1" border). Since      strength and security were very important, we used plenty      of masking tape to put the frame together.<br />      <br />      The next step was to find a "plot" to put the house on.      Ideally, its yard would extend at least 6 inches beyond the      structure on all sides. Corrugated cardboard, polystyrene      foam, a breadboard, a large baking pan, or some similar      item that had been covered with taped-down aluminum foil      would serve well for the base.<br />      <br />      Because we wanted our little house to light up, we ran a      small night-light fixture through a hole in the base,      secured it with electrical tape, and peeled the foil back      to prevent shocks. (Bulbs larger than a five watt Christmas      tree lamp could burn or melt the house's interior, and      candles not only would be dangerous especially with a      cardboard frame-but also would be very difficult to light      in the completed dome.) We then used masking tape to secure      the frame over the light.<br />      <br />      Now, we needed to find a site for the finished project.      That display area, we rea soned, would have to be close to      an electrical outlet . . . out of the reach of small hands      and pets . . . and fitting for an elaborate Christmas      decoration. Finally, we decided on the dining room table,      although this limited our eating space somewhat.<br />      <br />      <strong>GINGERBREAD HOUSE BASICS</strong><br />      <br />      You could feel the excitement in the air as the first batch      of gingerbread was being mixed. First, in a saucepan, we      put together 3/4 cup of brown sugar, 3/4 cup of molasses,      and 3/4 cup of butter (margarine could be used instead) . .      . and heated the mixture over a low flame until it began to      bubble. At that point, we took it off the stove, and when      it was just barely warm, added 1 large egg, stirring until      it disappeared.<br />      <br />      Next, in a big bowl we mixed 4-1/2 cups of whole wheat      flour . . . 1 teaspoon each of salt, baking powder, and      cinnamon . . . 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda . . . 1/4      teaspoon of cloves . . . and 1 tablespoon of ginger. Then      in went the molasses mixture, to be stirred until a thick      dough was formed. This was put on a floured breadboard (a      piece of waxed paper would have done as well), and was      pressed and kneaded-just like bread dough-for 5 to 10      minutes until it was the consistency of clay. Finally, we      patted it out into a rectangle and left it in a sealed      plastic bag to" rest" overnight.<br />      <br />      The next day, we set the oven at 350Â°F and, on a      floured board, rolled out the dough until it was about 1/8"      thick. After strategically arranging the cardboard pattern      pieces on it, I used a sharp knife to cut the shapes out.      (We saved the scraps in a plastic bag and rerolled them to      cut more pieces.) Then I cut out the windows and doors with      the knife and a floured cookie cutter. All in all, it took      three batches of dough to make the necessary gingerbread      "plywood" for our house . . . along with a few gingerbread      men and women, for fun.<br />      <br />      We placed the cookie pieces an inch apart on a flat pan and      baked them 12 to 15 minutes. We also made some "test      cookies" for each batch that went into the oven. These told      us when the house parts were thoroughly cooked, because      cookies used in construction <em>must</em> be crisp all the      way through.<br />      <br />      (If some of the cookies got dark too fast, we took them out      and finished cooking the rest.) "STAINED GLASS" WINDOWS      Since we wanted our gingerbread dome to be very special, we      filled in all the window and door spaces with brightly      colored "glass" made from melted Lifesaver candies. (The      clear fruit-flavored ones seemed to work best.)<br />      <br />      After separating the candies by color, we placed each batch      between layers of waxed paper. Then we crushed each mound      of sweets with a mallet. The tiny bats were spooned into      the windows and doors that were cut into the cookie pieces.      If you try making windows, however, keep in mind that the      pan <em>must</em> be lined with aluminum foil before you      put the unbaked cookie pieces on it. Then, when the      gingerbread is about half cooked-with 6 to 8 minutes more      to go-add the crushed candy, which will melt together to      form a smooth pane. Sometimes the proper timing is hard to      estimate, and the windows burn and turn brown before the      cookies are done. But if you cook the solid pieces first,      you'll be better able to judge just how much baking time is      generally required.<br />      <br />      Once the gingerbread was cooled enough to touch, we put the      pattern pieces on top and trimmed off any excess cookie      with a sharp knife. Otherwise, the house would have been      difficult, if not impossible, to put together. If you break      or burn a piece, make a new one . . . though small cracks      can be repaired later with frosting. (Any leftover dough      can be used to populate your ginger!,read world with cookie      people, animals, trees, and vehicles.)<br />      <br />      We let the edible boards dry overnight before putting the      dome together, but made sure they were out of the reach of      hungry pets and little (and big!) fingers.<br />      <br />      <strong>FROSTING GLUE</strong><br />      <br />      With the dome home ready for construction, the next step      involved making some frosting "glue". We blended 3 cups of      powdered sugar and 1/2 teaspoon of cream of tartar in a      small bowl, added this to two egg whites-a little at a      time-and then mixed it with an electric beater on low      speed. (You can also whip it with a spoon.) That done, we      put in 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. (For a flavor      variation, use 1 tablespoon of vanilla and I tablespoon of      water.) We wanted the icing to be about as thick as mashed      potatoes. When it wasn't just right, we added sugar to      thicken it, or put in lemon juice (or water) to thin it. We      found that paste food coloring produced dark, dramatic      effects, and liquid colors gave pleasing pastel      shades.<br />      <br />      Since interruptions could occur when the dome was being      built, we kept the icing from drying out by covering the      bowl with plastic wrap when we weren't working on our      creation. In fact, when tightly covered, the frosting could      be stored overnight, if necessary. We also discovered that      it was best, when using the topping, to keep the bowl      covered at least halfway with a damp cloth, a paper towel,      or some plastic wrap to keep it from hardening too      fast.<br />      <br />      Now the fun began! First, we brushed the crumbs from each      piece. Since we had a cardboard frame, it really didn't      matter where we <em>starred,</em> but it made sense to work      from the ground level up. Our frosting glue was put on the      back edges of each piece (where it met the frame) and along      the seams (where they met other cookies) . . . and applied      so that it was about the thickness of the gingerbread      itself. (You can use a butter knife, a small spatula, or a      cake decorator with a medium tip to apply this      "cement".)<br />      <br />      As we put each cookie in place, we held it a minute or two      until it stuck on firmly. Frosting would sometimes ooze out      between the pieces, but we thought that simply added to the      dome's charm. However, you can smooth these seams, if      desired, with a damp cloth. Once the basic structure was      complete, we let it dry overnight before continuing the      project.    </p>            <p>      <strong>DELIGHTFUL DETAILS</strong><br />      <br />      Adding the home's finishing touches turned out to be the      most fascinating part of this project. Gingerbread porches,      woodsheds, overhanging roofs, balconies, and decks can be      attached with icing, while candy-cane pillars and columns      will give such creations added stability and      strength.<br />      <br />      As it happened, detailing the gingerbread dome also proved      to be the most <em>time consuming</em> part of the      operation. For example, my assigned task of adding the      wafer-cookie shingles ("sawed" into small pieces with a      steak knife) one by one with frosting glue took a full two      days. Once that was accomplished, the whole family joined      in to decorate the house with gumdrops, small colored candy      "lights", licorice whips, and frosting icicles.<br />      <br />      The yard, though, still sparkled with aluminum foil,      so-with icing snow-we added the "outside" atmosphere,      building drifts around the house and beside the carob-chip      walkways. (You can, by the way, use cotton and/or coconut      if you don't want to use that much sugar!) Real trees      (cuttings from shrubs outside) sprang up on the      snow-covered lawn, anchored with icing and toothpicks      through holes in the base. Marshmallow trees were planted      by the house's front door. Large pretzels became firewood      and split-rail fences, and a cardboard mailbox on a pretzel      pole was placed near the fence, complete with tiny letters      and Christmas cards.<br />      <br />      Finally, we added a dog figurine by the mailbox, a small      ceramic cat sat on the front porch roof, and a wax snowman      smiled in the yard. It was complete! We stepped back and      admired our magnificent gingerbread dome home. With light      shining through its colored windows and a sifting of      powdered sugar snow over everything, the little      confectionary dwelling seemed to come alive, and we caught      ourselves peering into the windows, as if we expected to      see miniature people busy inside. "I wish I lived there,"      was our common sentiment.<br />      <br />      <strong>AND THEN</strong><br />      <br />      . . . As the days passed, one by one the carob chips      disappeared from the walkway. And then the shingles were      missing from one corner of the porch overhang. Christmas      was over. Little "mice" began nibbling away at the      beautiful structure. One day the fence was gone, then one      piece of the house, and another, and another . . . until      all that was left was a cardboard frame, an aluminum base,      and some unforgettable memories of a home made of      gingerbread shaped like a dome.    </p>    <hr />
