                  <p><strong>      Here's another mother-tested recipe</strong></p>       		<h5 id="byline">by JOYCE EVANS</h5>    <p>      It's true: There's nothing like hot, homemade soup on a      chilly winter day. And here's a recipe for one      soup-containing suet and <em>lots</em> of      vegetables-that I especially enjoy:    </p>    <p>      First, cut a half cup to a full cup of suet (most      supermarket meat departments will give it to you free!)      into very small pieces and place the bits of fat in the      bottom of a large (at least six quarts) pot or kettle.      Simmer over low heat until the suet begins to liquefy and      turn clear.    </p>    <p>      Next, add about two quarts of tomatoes to the pot, along      with an equal amount of water (and/or leftover vegetable      juices). Cut or slice one large onion, two stalks of      celery, one or two carrots, two big potatoes, and a half      pound of string beans into small chunks and add them to the      kettle ... then stir in a cup of peas and a quarter pound      or so of barley, plus any other ingredients you think the      soup should have. Salt and pepper to taste.    </p>    <p>      Simmer the vegetable-containing broth for a couple of      hours, or a couple of days . . . whichever. Then, just      before you're ready to serve it up, make some old-fashioned      dumplings:    </p>    <p>      In a clean bowl-one that has a flat bottom, so you      can work-break an egg, beat it, and slowly stir into      the bowl a dry mixture consisting of half a cup of flour,      one teaspoon of baking powder, and a pinch of salt.      Continue to beat with a fork until-when all the flour      has been added (and, possibly, a little bit      extra)-you have a bowl full of dry, lumpy      "dumplings". Add these to your soup and simmer another 15      minutes . . . then serve!    </p>    <p>      (If you have an especially large amount of soup, you may      want to double the dumpling recipe.)    </p>    <p>      This simple but hearty soup will keep you as warm as any      fire will, without burning a hole in your pocketbook!    </p>
