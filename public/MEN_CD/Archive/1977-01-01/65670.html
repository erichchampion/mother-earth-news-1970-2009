           		            <h5 id="byline">by       VADONNA JEAN LEAF    </h5>    <p>      <strong>How to turn bushels of garden potatoes into loads      of good eatin' . . . and have some fun in the kitchen,      too!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here's a special treat for any family that enjoys truly      hearty meat-and-potato meals. It's called <em>potato      bologna,</em> and it's one of the most economical-yet      filling-old-timey foods I know of. It's also a lot of      fun to make!    </p>    <p>      We cook up a big batch of these bolognas once a      year-in November-to serve with holiday meals,      give away to friends, or just to have handy for those      chilly winter nights when the ole taste buds water for this      savory dish. You can make potato bologna any time of the      year, though. It's easy:    </p>    <p>      First, round up some natural, 100%-hog-intestine      <em>sausage casings.</em> Check all the local meat markets      . . . and if that fails to reward you with any of the      "bologna wrappers", try a slaughterhouse. One pound of      casings-roughly a dollar's worth-will be enough      to make 12 to 15 individual bolognas.    </p>    <p>      And you do want <em>pork</em> casings . . . not beef. The      latter are simply too large in diameter for this use.    </p>    <p>      OK. Once you've brought the casings home, it's time to wash      'em to remove the salt cure (which they'll probably have if      you bought 'em in a store). Begin by soaking the skins in      cold water to cleanse them <em>outside</em> . . .      then-in order to clean 'em <em>inside</em>      -pull one end of each casing over the mouth of a      water faucet, gently turn the cold water on, and-to      avoid a blowout-carefully unkink the delicate tubing      by hand as it fills. (if you're working with <em>fresh</em>      pig innards, you'll want to be sure to <em>boil</em> the      washed viscera, to kill harmful micro-organisms.)    </p>    <p>      When you've finished washing it, cut the long tube into a      number of 15-to 20-inch segments. (True, you could've done      this before you began the washing operation . . .      but-in my experience-it's more fun for everyone      if the casing is left in just one slippery, flexible piece      as long as possible.)    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to make bologna!    </p>    <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>    <p>      10 pounds of raw potatoes<br />      1 medium onion<br />      3 pounds of ground beef<br />      3 pounds of pork sausage<br />      3 teaspoons of sea salt<br />      1 teaspoon of allspice<br />      1 teaspoon of pepper    </p>    <p>      Peel the potatoes, cover them with water in a large pot,      boil for one minute, and drain. This parboiling will keep      the spuds from dripping profusely during the next step . .      . which is to put the taters through the meat grinder,      using a coarse blade setting. (While you're at it, grind up      the onion as well. You can-if you want-grind up      two onions . . . but remember that the onion flavor will      become noticeably stronger after you freeze the bologna.)    </p>    <p>      Now combine the meats, potatoes, onion, and spices. Mix      thoroughly. (Note: You can substitute marjoram, sage,      and/or rose mary for the allspice . . . however, you might      want to make up a small "trial" bologna and taste it before      deciding which spices-and how much of them-to      use in your own personal recipe.)    </p>    <p>      The next step is to-somehow-stuff the      meat-and-potatoes mixture into the 15" lengths of casing.      Some kitchen mixers and grinders come with sausage-stuffing      aids . . . but if yours (like mine) doesn't, you'll have to      improvise. What I do is fit the end of a short piece of      1"-diameter pipe into the end of a casing, then pack the      meat-and-potatoes mix into the pipe with my fingers. (This      can be a mite messy . . . which is why I limit my bologna      making to one grand slam per year!)    </p>    <p>      Regardless of how you do it, pack each casing until it's      almost full, but not taut. (It'll swell as it cooks.)    </p>    <p>      At this point, you can do either of two things: [1] store      your uncooked bolognas in the freezer until they're needed,      or [2] cook 'em, <em>then</em> freeze 'em. t usually take      the first route.    </p>    <p>      Cooking the bolognas is simple. Just cover one (or more)      with water in a pan and boil <em>gently,</em> without a      lid, for 30 to 45 minutes (depending on the size of the      bologna) . . . then lift the big sausage or sausages out of      the water, set 'em on a plate to cool for a few minutes,      and serve.    </p>    <p>      I should mention that some folks like to tie their      bolognas' ends shut with string prior to cooking . . . in      which case it's necessary to prick the casings (to release      trapped steam during cooking) before the sausages are      simmered. I prefer simply to cook each portion with the      ends loose, however. The steam seeps out through the ends .      . . and the filling-for reasons I don't      understand-stays right where it should.    </p>    <p>      To eat the bologna, just fork the steaming-hot      meat/potato/onion/ spice mixture out of the skin one bite      at a time. (Afterwards, discard the casing.) You'll find      that the bologna's subtle, distinctive flavor makes it      equally enjoyable as a snack, appetizer, side dish, or main      dish.    </p>    <p>      Once you've tried it, I'm sure you'll agree: There's      nothing quite like good, old-fashioned potato bologna!    </p>
