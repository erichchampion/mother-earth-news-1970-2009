                       <h5 id="byline">by BOB WHALLON:</h5>    <p>      If you live on the land (or reside in town but still      butcher your own meat), you probably know a great deal      about cutting up and using the main carcass of a cow, hog,      etc. Chances are good that you've even learned to save and      enjoy some of the many "extras"-brains, tongue,      liver, heart, head cheese, souse, oxtail, pigs' trotters,      and so on-that come so neatly packaged with that main      carcass.    </p>    <p>      (Using or not using these cuts can mean the difference      between butchering economically or wastefully. It can also      mean the difference between enjoying some mighty good      eating and losing out completely on a few of the most      tender, tasty, and nutritious cuts of meat that you're      likely to find anywhere.)    </p>    <p>      Still, there's another (less well-known) "extra" cut of      meat that almost all of us waste, whether from ignorance or      prejudice. I'm talking about "mountain oysters", the      testicles removed from male animals so that they'll develop      more quickly and-when later butchered-dress out      into meat that is more tender and flavorful.    </p>    <p>      (Sheep and goats, of course, are usually castrated with      special elastic rings nowadays, which means that their      testicles are seldom available for use. Such testes are so      small that they're hardly worth saving anyway. Pigs and      calves, on the other hand, are an entirely different story:      It's still general practice to remove their testes      surgically . . . and the glands are definitely large enough      to make a meal from.)    </p>    <p>      Each testicle hangs by a group of tubes (the spermatic duct      and blood supply and return) which lead into a twisted mass      of tubules. All of this ducting is discarded until only the      gland itself-smooth, egg-shaped, creamy white in      color, and containing meat of a very fine texture-is      left. The testis is then skinned, cut in half lengthwise,      and cooked. (And it does look a lot like an oyster when      it's prepared.)    </p>    <p>      Mountain oysters are often just battered-or not      battered-and lightly fried . . . but they're probably      the tastiest when broiled, either in the stove or (if      possible) over charcoal. About two minutes per side-or a      total of four to five minutes in the broiler-is all      the cooking the delicious treats need.    </p>    <p>      As is the case with most glandular meats, testicles are      very rich in protein, vitamins, and minerals. They      are-in short-very healthful and nourishing      food. <em>And</em> <em>they have absolutely no effect on      the hormone balance of the person who eats them.</em>    </p>    <p>      Testes-which, after all, were designed by nature to      be the source of the next generation-seem to      concentrate the very essence of life into their meat . . .      and it's all reflected in their delectable taste and      texture! Mountain oysters are spoon-cutting tender and have      a very light flavor that is truly fit for royalty. Unlike      so many of the other "finer things in life", however,      there's no reason to ration them out in unsatisfyingly      small servings: A pair of the glands from one calf wilt      supply enough meat for a big meal for one person . . . or a      breakfast (with eggs) or a snack or light lunch for two.    </p>    <p>      Of course, if you're willing to consider a plateful of      mountain oysters, you're probably the kind of person who      bakes your own bread and brews your own beer too. In that      case, you should consider one of our favorite midnight      meals (which we like to savor after a long rap with      friends).    </p>    <p>      Fry your "oysters" lightly and put 'em on a hot plate to      keep warm. Then cook some whole wheat flour to a golden      brown in the pan drippings, add some milk, and simmer the      whole mixture another five minutes or until the "floury"      taste has been cooked from the gravy. Toast some bread at      the same time . . . then put two halves of a gland on each      slice, cover with gravy, and serve with a crisp salad and      mugs of your own homebrew.    </p>    <p>      "Bails, bread, and beer," we call it. "Mighty good fare,"      is what anybody would call it.    </p>
