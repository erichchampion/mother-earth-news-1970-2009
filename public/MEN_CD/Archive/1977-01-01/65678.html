            			 			<h3>BASIC BREAD</h3>    <p>			 <strong>(Yield: two loaves)</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 packages of active<br />      dry yeast<br />      2 tablespoons of salt<br />      7 cups of unsifted,<br />      unbleached white flour 2-1/4 cups of milk<br />      1/2 cup of honey<br />      2 eggs, beaten<br />      1/2 stick of margarine<br />      1/4 cup of peanut oil    </p>    <p>      Combine the yeast and salt with two cups of flour in a      large mixing bowl. Heat the milk, honey, eggs, margarine,      and oil together in a saucepan until the margarine has      melted . . . then add the warm (but not hot) blend to the      bowl containing the yeast, salt, and flour. Beat until all      ingredients are thoroughly mixed (30 seconds at low speed      and three minutes at medium, ii you're using an electric      mixer). By hand, stir in enough extra flour (approximately      five cups) to form a soft dough. Knead the dough on a      floured breadboard until a satiny finish has developed      (about one minute), then place the big ball in a greased      bowl, cover, and set in a warm (about 110° F) spot.      When the dough has risen to double its original size (about      45 minutes), punch it down and knead it for five minutes.      Afterwards, divide the sponge in half, shape it Into two      loaves, and place them in buttered or greased pans.      (Vegetable oil is not recommended, as it will cause the      finished bread to stick to the pan.) Cover the loaves with      a dish towel, set them in a warm place to rise,      and-when they've doubled in size-bake them In a      preheated 350° oven for 45 minutes or until they've      turned deep brown in color and sound hollow when lightly      tapped. (HIGH ALTITUDE ADJUSTMENT: At 5,000-foot elevation,      bake this bread in a 375° oven for 35 to 40 minutes.)</p>      <h3>HONEY WHEAT BREAD</h3>      <p><strong>(Yield: one large loaf)</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 package of active dry yeast<br />      1/4 cup of warm water<br />      1/4 cup of honey<br />      2 tablespoons of shortening 1-1/2 teaspoons of salt<br />      1-1/4 cups of water<br />      4-1/2 cups of unsifted whole wheat flour<br />      1 egg    </p>    <p>      Dissolve the yeast in a quarter cup of warm water and set      the solution aside. Heat the honey, shortening, salt, and      remaining water together in a saucepan until the shortening      has melted, cool till lukewarm . . . then combine the tepid      mixture with the yeast in a large bowl. Now add one and a      half cups of whole wheat flour and the egg to the liquid      ingredients and mix thoroughly. Stir in enough extra wheat      flour (about three cups) by hand to form a stiff dough,      then turn the dough out onto a floured breadboard and knead      until it's smooth and elastic. Transfer the mass to a      greased bowl, turn once (to coat the dough's surface with      oil), and set in a warm place. When the sponge has doubled      in size, punch it down . . . then shape it into a ball and      allow it to stand for 10 minutes. Afterwards, form the mass      into a loaf, place the loaf in a well-greased baking pan,      cover with a dish towel, and let stand in a warm place      until the sponge has doubled in size. Finally, bake the      loaf in a preheated 375° oven for 40 minutes, or until      it sounds hollow when tapped. Turn onto a wire rack to      cool. </p>						<h3>ONION LOVER'S LOAF</h3>			<p>      <strong>(Yield: one large loaf)</strong> for dough:<br />      1 package of active dry yeast<br />      1/4 cup of warm water<br />      4 cups of unbleached, unsifted white flour<br />      1/4 cup of honey<br />      1-1/4 teaspoons of salt<br />      1/2 cup of hot water<br />      1/2 cup of milk<br />      1/4 cup (one half stick) of soft butter or margarine<br />      1 egg, beaten<br />      <br />      for filling:<br />      1/2 cup (one stick) of butter or margarine<br />      1 cup of finely chopped onion (or 1/4 cup of instant minced      onion)<br />      1 tablespoon of sesame or poppy seeds<br />      1 tablespoon of grated cheese (Parmesan is best)<br />      1 teaspoon of garlic salt<br />      1 teaspoon of paprika<br /> To make the dough, dissolve the yeast      in a quarter cup of warm water in a large mixing bowl. Then      add two cups of flour-and all the remaining dough      ingredients-to the bowl, and blend at low speed (or      by hand) for two minutes (or until everything is well      mixed). Stir in enough extra flour-roughly two      cups-to form a soft dough.<br /> Cover the bowl, set in a      warm spot, and allow the dough to rise until it has doubled      in size (45 minutes to an hour). Afterwards, punch the      dough down, toss it on a floured board until it's no longer      sticky, and roll the elastic mass out to a 12" X 18"      rectangle. <br />Next, melt a stick of butter or margarine in a      saucepan add the other filling ingredients to the pan, and      stir. <br />Spread this onlony "sauce" out over the rectangular      piece of dough, cut the rectangle lengthwise into three 4"      X 18" strips, and-starting along the 18"      side-roll up each strip. Pinch the ends closed, ace      the three 18"-long "ropes" buttery seams down on a      well-greased cookie sheet, and braid them together. Then      cover and let rise until the dough is light and double in      size (45 minutes to an hour). Bake in a preheated 350°      oven for 30 to 35 minutes, or until the braided loaf is      golden brown.<br /> Clara Watkins-who sent these excellent      recipes to MOTHER-says: "My instructions can be changed to      suit your individual taste. I've found-and no doubt      you will too-that by tasting the dough periodically,      it's possible to tell when more of any one ingredient is      needed. The important thing is, feel free to experiment.      "Also, I'd like to point out that you don't need a regular      three-inch by five-inch by nine-inch loaf pan to bake good      bread. Any old pan will work, and the final product will      taste the same." So what are you waiting for? Round up your      ingredients preheat your oven, break out your best piepans      . . . and bake your own hot bread!    </p>
