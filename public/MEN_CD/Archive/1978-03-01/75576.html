                    <p>      For the past several years, the good folks at the Institute      for Local Self. Reliance in Washington, D.C. have worked to      help urban residents gain greater control over their lives      through the use of low-technology, decentralist tools and      concepts. We strongly believe that more people (city      dwellers and country folk alike) should be exposed to the      Institute's efforts ... which is why we're now making this      "what's happening where" report by ILSR staffers one of      MOTHER's regular features.    </p>    <p>      There's no question that the new focus on energy and food      self-reliance has sparked a good deal of interest in      low-cost "solar" greenhouses lately Oust look through the      last year's worth of MOTHER, and you'll see what we mean).      All across the country, people are experimenting with new      methods of greenhouse design and management, In some cases,      this experimentation is helping to provide highquality food      for those who can least afford to buy it.    </p>    <p>      Of course, as many groups have learned the hard way, the      greenhouse business can be a tricky one. In Frobisher Bay      in the Northwest Territories, Canada, an experiment with      greenhouses for the local Eskimo population ran into      serious planning problems, the biggest of which involved      crop selection. For example, instead of choosing vitamin-      and mineral-rich indigenous sorrel for cultivation, the      greenhouse managers chose to produce lettuce. Lettuce      commanded a higher price, but the Eskimos didn't want to      eat it ... so the project had to be redesigned.    </p>    <p>      Here in the States, however, several organic greenhouse      projects designed to benefit low-income people have proven      to be quite successful. For example, in the past year or so      Bill Yanda and his staff at the Solar Sustenance Project in      New Mexico have conducted 19 different weekend greenhouse      workshops ... each of which involved the actual      construction of a 10' X 16' or 10' X 20' greenhouse. (Of      those 19 greenhouses, only two are having any trouble with      organization or cultivation.) The Project also recently      completed a 1,600-square-foot greenhouse on the Navajo      Nation for a Catholic mission for retarded youth. In each      case, the folks who build the greenhouse also manage it.    </p>    <p>      So far, almost 1,100 people have attended the Solar      Sustenance Project's workshops in New Mexico. To get an      idea of how useful these study programs have actually been,      Bill Yanda chose 100 of the 1,100 people at random and sent      them short questionnaire cards to see if they planned on      using their newly acquired greenhouse expertise. Of the 40      persons who answered the solicitation, 13 replied that they      had already built a greenhouse and 28 more wrote that they      did plan to build one. Which means that it the sample of      100 was a representative one, there are already 130      greenhouses in New Mexico built by people who attended      Solar Sustenance workshops.    </p>    <p>      The Domestic Technology Institute in Evergreen, Colorado is      another example of an organization that has been successful      in providing technical assistance to groups interested in      constructing solar reliant greenhouses. Already, more than      500 people have gone through DTI's one-week training      sessions. One of DTI's most exciting projects was carried      out in the summer of 1976 in conjunction with Cheyenne,      Wyoming's Community Action Agency. In this undertaking, 20      teenagers (all but one of whom were on probation) were      hired as part of CAA's Summer Youth Employment program to      build three small (12' X 16') greenhouses. After a one-week      training session in tool use, building methods, and public      presentation, the crews began work. By the end of the      summer, completed greenhouses were in operation at a local      Head Start center, a community food and nutrition center,      and a local food co-op. All three greenhouses make use of      organic planting methods and are managed primarily by      people already working at the three sites.    </p>    <p>      This experience has led Domestic Technology and the      Cheyenne CAA to plan a large-scale community greenhouse.      The building will-when it's finished-offer 5,000 square      feet of growing space in three separate but interconnected      buildings. (This arrangement permits the existence of      different micro-environments within the structure. Equally      important, the greenhouse is designed in such a way that      unskilled builders can do the construction work.) A site      has already been donated by a member of the community. The      finished greenhouse will be maintained by the participants      in a "meals for the low-income elderly" program, and the      food produced in the building will be used in that program.    </p>    <p>      Large-scale greenhouses are also being planned in      Washington, D.C. and in New Hampshire. "I can't even begin      to tell you how many solar greenhouses have been or are now      being built," explains Andrea Dunn of DTI. "But I can tell      you that it is happening all over!"
