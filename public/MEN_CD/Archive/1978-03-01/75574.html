                    <p>      Being some good things we want to share. Money won't buy      you a spot In ACCESS, but suggestions are Invited. Is there      something that YOU want to share?    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      BES-PAK PHOTODEGRADABLE TRASH BAGS Bes-Pak and Co., Inc.    </h3>    <h3>      Montgomery, Ala. 36109    </h3>    <p>      Chemical additives, Plastic , and waste all rate right at      the bottom of our "favorite things" list. But-by taking one      of the first (polygrade) ... and adding It to the second      (in the form of plastic trash bags) ... you end up with a      better solution to the third. A photodegradable trash bag.    </p>    <p>      Photodegradable simply means that a chemical additive      (polygrade) In the plastic is activated by the ultraviolet      rays of the sun. Then-usually within a few weeks or      months-depending on climatic conditions and length of      exposure, the plastic will break down Into harmless natural      elements. And this occurs even If the bag is buried in a      landfill. Kinds like banana peels, clam shells, and other      examples of nature's own biodegradable containers.    </p>    <p>      An estimated five billion large trash bags were used by the      American consumer In 1976. Of these, approximately 16      percent were Incinerated, five percent recycled, and the      remainder-yes, that comes to some four billion plastic      sacks-ended up at sanitary landfills, In open dumps, and/or      littering the countryside.    </p>    <p>      These numbers, plus the fact that many communities now      require the use of plastic bags for trash pickup anyway,      point up the need for a product like the BES-PAK      PHOTODEGRADABLE TRASH BAG. The sacks cost about ton  cents      apiece, and have a stable shelf life. (In other words, If      you buy a box, they won't do a disappearing act In your      kitchen cabinets.)    </p>    <p>      Nope. This ain't the perfect solution to a problem that's      rapidly getting out of hand. But It most certainly does      appear to be a noteworthy stop In the right direction. -RH.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HORTICULTURE</strong><br />      125 Garden St.<br />      Marion, Ohio 43302<br />      (for subscriptions)    </p>    <p>      It'd be nice to be able to say that the Incredibly      beautiful full-page color photograph (portrait may be more      appropriate) of a solitary "Peace" rose In the January 1978      Issue of HORTICULTURE was.alone. Impressive enough to      warrant subscribing to this extremely Informative monthly      publication of the Massachusetts Horticultural Society.    </p>    <p>      To do so, however (and not that it Isn't true, value would      dilute the overall scope and of the magazine. This      publication very definitely Is not a collection of      "stereotypically exquisite" photos of various roses,      orchids, violets, and other "silver-haired ladies' species      of flora" coupled with the usual highbrow articles on how      to keep your pewter pots polished.    </p>    <p>      Rather, HORTICULTURE Is a genuine, "hands on" tool for the      person Interested In up-to-date, accurate, "how to"      Information related to growing just about anything. There      are regular columns on greenhouse gardening, Indoor plants,      and-especially interesting.a "Horticultural Camara" section      dealing with the problems and techniques of photographing      that part of nature in which man gardens ... Inside and      out. ("Flowers fads, plants die, but a photograph      endures.")    </p>    <p>      That same January 1978 Issue contained articles as current      and varied as a profile of Interior Secretary (and former      Idaho potato-pushing governor) Cecil Andrus, a piece on      Arizona's cactus-not cattle.rustling problems, "Plant Posts      and Their Natural Enemies", "Of All Flowers, Methinks a      Rose Is Best" (with those fabulous photographs), and a      thorough presentation on "New Faces for the 1978 Garden" by      MOTHER contributor Derek Fell.    </p>    <p>      All that-plus a classified section and a coupon collector's      cornucopia of seed, nursery, and gardening equipment      catalogs guaranteed to inkstain the greenest thumb-make      this quality publication ($1.25 per issue, $10/year U.S.,      $11 Canada, $12 elsewhere) must reading.RH.    </p>    <h3>      GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESSFUL JOGGING    </h3>    <p>      Rory Donaldson and the National Jogging Association 919      18th St. N.W., Suits 830 Washington, D.C. 20006    </p>    <p>      "We are born with a 70-year warranty. But we never bother      to read the Instructions," says Dr. George Sheehan,      cardiologist, one of the most respected "running      authorities on running", and medical editor of Runner's      World magazine (P.O. Box 366, Mountain View, Calif. 94040,      published monthly, $9.50/year).    </p>    <p>      This quote is certainly not a startling revelation to most      of us. Poor diet, negative environmental factors, and lack      of exercise are taking their toll (5,000 coronary heart      disease deaths in the U.S. In 1920,700,00 In 1972). And we      all know people (maybe we greet one In the mirror each      morning) who are "out of shape" or-even worse-in a shape      that resembles something other than a fit human being. Get      this book for that person, especially If "that person" is      you!    </p>    <p>      GUIDELINES FOR SUCCESSFUL JOGGING Is just what the title      implies. Guidelines-both general and specific-to got the      novice out the door, moving those feet, and-more      Important.moving the old ticker. A "target heart rate" Is      what It's all about (the "goal" of this non-goaloriented      81/2" X 5-1121 booklet). Which simply means that you      maintain a particular maximum heart rate for a particular      period of time. The result is cardiovascular fitness ...      Improved quantity and I quality of life.    </p>    <p>      The 158 pages of this easy-to-read, hard-to-put-down      revised (1977) edition are packed with advice (what to      wear, when to jog, how to jog, how much to jog, when not to      jog, etc.) and enough humor to keep you smiling as you      stretch through those warm-up exercises ... and eager to      get out and discover just where those unchained Dobermans      really are In your neighborhood.    </p>    <p>      The point is that GUIDELINES is readable, workable, usable      information. Included is a 12-week diary for recording your      progress, references for more specific advice, and just      about all the answers to all the questions you might have      about jogging. And the manual is available from the good      folks at the National Jogging Association (note their      aforementioned new address) I for only $4.35 postpaid,      quantity discounts I counts available.    </p>    <p>      The Zen expression "learning to get out of your own way" is      particularly appropriate here.

Dolensek, D.V.M. and Joseph Bell Publications      Dept., Now York Zoological Society Bronx, N.Y.10460    </p>    <p>      This is the kind of publication that just shouldn't be      necessary In a rational world. In our world, however-where      names like Torrey Canyon and Argo Merchant still stick like      the crude oil they dumped in our oceans-it is both      necessary and welcome.    </p>    <p>      A recent United Nations report estimates that a million and      a half tons of oil are dumped Into the oceans each year.      And this petroleum affects the environment far more      seriously than merely keeping the tourists out of the water      at Miami Beach. (We can only estimate-and shudder at the      short- and long-term consequences for fish, shellfish, and      marine wildlife.)    </p>    <p>      Well, now-in addition to wringing our hands and shaking our      fists at the megabuck oil corporations-we can take some      direct action designed to right some of an oil spill's      wrongs. HELP! tells us how.    </p>    <p>      I This thorough and concise little (8" X 6", 1 39-page)      booklet sidesteps the politics involved and gets right into      the "doing" part of saving the waterfowl victims of a      spill. If It tells how to report a spill and organize the      rescue ... includes sections on identifying, catching,      handling, transporting, cleaning, and giving basic      veterinary care to damaged birds ... . and-if you've been      both skilled and fortunate.explains how to release the fowl      to fly again.    </p>    <p>      HELP! is a special supplement to Animal Kingdom, a magazine      that Is published specifically for North America's leading      zoological societies. It would be expected, therefore, that      HELP! would be a very professional and accurate      publication. It is ... and then some.    </p>    <p>      The price (50  cents per copy, quantity discounts available,      checks/money orders payable to Animal Kingdom magazine) Is      very reasonable ... and the Information Invaluable.

Which,      unfortunately, means that tens of thousands of good folks      (perhaps you're one of them) would now love to build their      own solar water heaters ... but just don't know how to go      about it.    </p>    <p>      Well friends, I'm here to tell you that this little problem      has now been solved. Despite the redundancy of its title      (after all, why use the sun's rays-or any other form of      energy-to heat water that's already hot?), this      little 76-page manual contains everything you'll ever need      to know to build and enjoy your very own sun-powered water      heater. The theory, of course, Is here but-even more      Important -so Is all the practical Information on the      subject that you've always wanted to know but didn't know      how to find out.    </p>    <p>      Codes, permits, materials, tools, actual construction      steps, and abundant, easy-to-follow diagrams. They're all      here ... plus a chapter of ton reference sources and two      appendices (one describes "alternative" solar water heating      systems and the other Is a master list of the materials      you'll need to construct the water heaters described in the      book).    </p>    <p>      Yessiree! The folks at the Eastern Oregon Community      Development Council have come up with as thorough and as      understandable a treatment of solar water heater      construction as we've yet seen (MOTHER's head of research      personally recommends it) ... and this guide is well worth      Its modest cost ($2.00 postpaid).    </p>    <p>      Oregon residents can order this manual from: State      Community Services Program, 772 Commercial St. S.E., Salem,      Ore. 97310.
