                <p>      True, you can't eat gourds. But what other fruit can you      make into canteens, lamps, ladles, bowls, and "pieces of      art" that sell for as much as $15 each?<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     by GORDON SOLBERG    </h5>    <p>      You might not have thought so, but gourds are actually an      ideal cash crop for the small-scale gardener/farmer: You      not only got the pleasure of watching the colorful "fruits"      grow, but-if you're at all artistically inclined-you      can also paint the mature gourds and sell them for as much      as $15 each. (When you consider that a single vine can      produce 30 fruits in a season ... you can see that you've      got a potential moneymaker on your hands.)    </p>        <p>      There are two main varieties of gourds: Cucurbita and      Lagenaria. The first kind - the cucurbits - are the small      striped or warted ones that you see strung up with Indian      corn in the fall. These fruits-which are closely related to      squash and pumpkins-have thin shells and bright      colors that quickly fade. You can sell them at the local      farmers' market in the autumn and make enough profit to pay      for your Thanksgiving dinner, but the selling season for      the cucurbits is short and the price per gourd low.    </p>    <p>      We make our $15 objets d'art from the other variety of      gourd, Lagenaria. Them hard-shelled beauties have      traditionally been used to make canteens, storage vessels,      and water dippers ... you've undoubtedly seen them many      times. The fruits grow on long vines that have      large-saucershaped leaves and fragrant white flowers which      open in the evening.    </p>    <p>      You can purchase seeds of the more common Lagenarias (such      as Birdhouse or Dumbbell) through any seed catalog. (A      packet of 50 seeds enough to grow over 1.000 gourds costs      about 5041.)    </p>    <p>      For beat results, the soil where you Intend to plant the      seeds should be rich and welldrained. (Dig a      wheelbarrow?load of compost into the ground where each vine      is to grow, and you'll be sure to have a bountiful crop.)      Also, the plants do their best when they're grown on      trellises in full sunlight. (The vines will produce a crop      if they're shaded part of the day ... but they'll give you      a lot more fruit if they're allowed to pack in those rays      from sunrise to sunset.) Make the trellis large - about 10      or 12 feet of trellis per plant is adequate, although the      vines can grow 30 or 40 feet-and above all, make the      support strong ... unripe gourds are heavy! (If you've got      a fence or a dead tree on your property, you won't have to      make a trellis at all: Lagenaria vines will climb any      object that they can wrap their tendrils around.)    </p>    <p>      Plant the seeds an inch deep after all danger of frost is      past. I sow about four seeds in a hill and space my hills      at least eight feet apart, then thin the seedlings to one      strong plant per hill a week or two after the tiny green      shoots have poked up through the ground. (A single healthy      vine will produce more gourds over its life span than      several small ones growing in the same area.)    </p>    <p>      Within a couple weeks of the time the seedlings break into      the sunlight, the vines will begin to grow at an incredible      speed. They'll branch and rebranch, form tendrils, and      start up the trellis ... then the first flowers the      long-stemmed male blossoms-will form. Female flowers      will follow shortly (you'll recognize them by their shorter      sterns and the embryonic gourdlets hidden below their      petals).    </p>    <p>      Of course, before gourds can begin to form, the male      flowers and the female flowers have to got together      somehow. This is normally taken care of by late-working      honeybees or moonlighting moths . . . but if nightflying      insects seem to be scarce in your area, you can always help      fertilization along by breaking off a male flower and      rubbing it against several female blooms.    </p>    <p>      From this point on, you have to make sure that your plants      don't go thirsty. A gourd vine -with its dozens of      platter-sized leaves-transpires (or "sweats") an      unbelievable amount of water during those dry, 100*      midsummer days ... and it it starts to wilt under the      afternoon sun you can kiss part of your crop goodbye, since      the smallest gourds will dry up and fall off.    </p>    <p>      Unless you got a heavy rain at least once a week In the      summer, then, your vines will have to be irrigated. This Is      a simple matter, though: Just use your hoe to build a low      6' X 6' dike around the base of each plant, and fill the      36-square-foot area with about 2" of water once a week (or      more often, if the plants' leaves start to go limp during      the hot part of the day). By fall you'll have a bumper crop      for sure.    </p>    <p>      We usually harvest our gourds after the first autumn frost.      (The cold air causes the plants' leaves to shrivel up      exposing the fruit.) You can harvest your crop earlier than      this if you want, however. You'll recognize the mature      gourds by their matte surface and dull-green color.      (Immature gourds are dark green, shiny, and covered with      "down".)    </p>    <p>      The next step is to let the gourds dry out. We start curing      ours in the sun on our porch roof, until we can get around      to bringing them indoors ... then we (1] pierce the stems      with a nail, (2] string the fruits together on a wire, and      [3] festoon them from the coiling next to the heater. About      four months later, they're bone-dry . . * and ready to be      converted into $15 "works of art". Here?briefly?is how we      work that conversion:    </p>    <p>      First, we select a symmetrical, blemish-free gourd and cut      off its top with a hacksaw. (A regular carpenter's saw will      do the job -if it's sharp, that is-but we prefer the      narrower cut that a hacksaw makes.) Next, we take a stick      and ream all the seeds out of the gourd. (Our goats and      chickens consider these a delicacy.) Then we sand off the      shiny outer skin since paint adheres best to a slightly      rough surface, and smooth off the saw cut at the top of the      gourd.    </p>    <p>      At this point. Judy begins to paint her design(s) onto the      gourd carcass using acrylic paint. When the acrylic is dry,      we cover the gourd with a coat of low-gloss varnish to      bring out the paint's colors and the gourd's texture.      And- finally - we sell it.    </p>    <p>      The selling of art objects -as we've learned so well -is an      art unto Itself ... unpredictable, frustrating, and      (occasionally) lucrative. Judy sells her gourds by several      routes: to individuals (for $10 to $15). to gift shops      outright (for $7.50 to $10), or on consignment (for $17.50      to $25, minus a commission to the store of 40 %).    </p>    <p>      There's money to be made from gourds, all right. It's not a      regular source of income by any means, but we aren't      choosy. . income's income as far as we're concerned. And      gourd-dealing is one of the more pleasant ways of making a      part-time buck that I can think of.    </p>    <p>      So how 'bout it? Why not put a little extra fun in your      gardening (and extra money in your pocket) this summer? You      can, if you grow gourds! *    </p>    <h3>      GOURD GROWERS OF THE WORLD, UNITE!    </h3>    <p>      Every gourd grower should know about the American Gourd      Society, Box 274, Mount Gilead, Ohio 43338. The Society      publishes a quarterly newsletter called (that's right) The      Gourd, which tells of the experiences of gourd raisers,      discusses gourd shows, and lists sources of seed. The      subscription price is $2.50 per year.    </p>    <p>      The Society also puts out a number of lowcost bulletins on      the finer points of gourd raising: hand pollination, the      training of vines, etc. One of the publications that the      AGS sells-Pear-son's Gourdcraft Manual-is a      real goodie. If you're thinking of making and selling gourd      objects, you should definitely look through this 54-page      booklet. In it, you'll find more than 1,000 photographs of      handmade gourd artifacts-lamps, match holders, hats,      purses, drums, masks, nut containers, violins, you name      It-plus a lifetime supply of ideas from a man who raised      gourds by the millions during the 1950's.?GS.    </p>
