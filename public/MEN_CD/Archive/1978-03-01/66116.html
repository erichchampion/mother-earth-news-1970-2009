                    <p>      We know that there are a lot of talented craftsmen and      craftswomen out there ... but how many of you are as good      at selling your designs as you are at creating them? Archie      and Myrna Ossin-craftspeople themselves-have      published a book in tended to help all you artists and      hobbyists go into business for yourselves ... and succeed!    </p>    <p>      The Ossins have used the principles set down in their book      for four years, and during that period they've turned a      nominal investment into a profitable craft business. That's      why we've chosen to reprint the following excerpts-which      are representative of the kind of levelheaded counsel      you'll find in the guide-from Archie and Myrna's      book.    </p>    <p>      In short, it you'd like to turn your craft-no matter what      it may be-into a moneymaker, read on!    </p>    <hr />    <p>      From How to Start and Run a Profitable Craft Business by      Archie and Myrna Ossin, copyright 1977 by Ossi      Publications, P.O. Box 141, Fern Park, Florida 32730.      Reprinted by permission. Available in paperback for $6.95      from the publisher, or from Mother's Bookshelf for $6.95      plus 95c shipping and handling.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      To start and run a profitable craft business, you must-of      course-have a specific product which can be made and      sold. THE IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A DEMAND      FOR THE THINGS THAT YOU CAN MAKE AT THE PRICES FOR WHICH      YOU WANT THEM TO SELL. If you enjoy doing something for      which you know there is little demand, or if your product      cannot be priced profitably, keep it as a hobby and start a      business with some other item.    </p>    <h3>      IDEAS FOR PRODUCTS    </h3>    <p>      There are three general areas from which you can develop      ideas for your products:    </p>    <p>      The craft hobbies that you now do<br />      New products which fill a public need<br />      Products currently being made, that you can improve in      appearance, performance, or marketability.<br />    </p>    <h3>      MARKETING THEMES YOU CAN USE    </h3>    <p>      Successfully sold handcrafted items are those which can be      associated with marketing themes. These themes include such      things as:    </p>    <p>      Baby items<br />      Office accessories<br />      Gift items<br />      Jewelry<br />      Home decoration items<br />      Houseplants<br />      Gardening<br />      Signs<br />      Furniture<br />      Automotive accessories<br />      Wedding accessories<br />      Decorations<br />    </p>    <p>      IT IS THE COMPATIBLE COMBINATION OF YOUR PRODUCT IDEAS WITH      ONE OF THESE MARKETING THEMES WHICH WILL YIELD A SUCCESSFUL      PRODUCT LINE. This marketing psychology will work for you      because retail outlets, gift shops, and other      establishments which will sell your product to the consumer      are organized by marketing themes.    </p>    <h3>      CHANGING THEMES FOR BETTER SALES: THREE EXAMPLES    </h3>    <p>      Example 1:    </p>    <p>      Macrame items are generally sold in plant shops, and      sometimes in furniture stores. One clever artist, with      declining sales, decided to work his macrame craft into a      different marketing theme. This artist drilled holes in      wooden "ABC" baby blocks, which he used as beads in his      macrame to make a plant hanger for a baby's room. He sold      this idea to an exclusive department store that displayed      his product with baby furniture rather than in the plant      section. He thus transformed his macrame work into a new      product and fitted it into a new marketing theme, where it      found its natural outlet with other baby accessories.    </p>    <p>      Example 2:    </p>    <p>      One of our friends who enjoyed woodworking used to make      wooden wall plaques with interesting sayings. He found,      though, that people didn't want to pay enough to enable him      to cover the costs involved in making his high quality      signs. A survey revealed, however, that local businesses      would pay considerably more money to obtain attractive      signs to be used on their premises. His signs are now in      parking lots, on store fronts, and in many other locations.      Changing his marketing theme from wall plaques to business      signs has led him to many new customers.    </p>    <p>      Example 3:    </p>    <p>      One artist had trouble selling his jewelry. He decided to      dye the beads used in the pieces so they would match blue      jeans. By doing this he rejuvenated his business, for he      now sells his jewelry to blue jean outlets.    </p>    <p>      There are endless applications of how you can fit your      craft products into marketing themes, and even change      themes to increase your sales. The extra thought that you      put into this area will pay off, for a good marketing theme      will always lead you to the people who'll buy your product.    </p>    <h3>      APPLYING YOUR CRAFT TO A MARKETING THEME    </h3>    <p>      Suppose you like to knit. Rather than knit many different      types of items-from baby booties to golf club      covers-you can combine knitting with any one of the      marketing themes mentioned. This helps you to define your      customer and to concentrate your attention on that area.      Following the next paragraph are examples of how knitting      can be combined with market themes to come up with product      ideas.    </p>    <p>      It would be best for you to select one theme, and      concentrate on developing and selling several products      which fall within that theme. Of course, the more unique      the product, the better your chances of making sales. Any      craft that you do can be viewed in this same way. Try      brainstorming, using your chosen craft to think of products      that will match each of the marketing themes listed below.      This short list Is by no means comprehensive, and you can      probably come up with other themes. You'll be amazed at how      many ideas you'll have. Go to department stores or shopping      malls for ideas. Ask your friends, read trade magazines,      and keep looking for new possibilities all the time.    </p>        <h3>      DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS    </h3>    <p>      New and unique products in all areas will always find a      market. With new materials continually being developed, the      range of available media from which items can be      handcrafted Is greatly expanding.    </p>    <p>      Inexpensive-yet elegant-furniture made from      glass and three-inch plastic piping and joints will      probably be in the marketplace on a large scale soon. Other      new product Ideas can be brought about by mixing "something      old with something new". A good example of this is the      combination of antique jewelry beads with new and modern      beads. A new twist to informal clothing was added when      artists specialized in tie-dying and painting T-shirts. One      artist was able to set up a large display of her      personalized T-shirts in the children's clothing area of a      department store. Other new ideas have included kitchen      accessories such as breadbaskets, napkin rings, etc., made      of bread-like dough material treated with a lacquer. These      have been popular all over the country, for they fit in      well in stores specializing in gourmet kitchen accessories.    </p>    <p>      You might devise a wooden metric calculator that can be a      kitchen decoration as well as a great culinary accessory.      Again, use your imagination and think of items you can make      that people need.    </p>    <h3>      IMPROVE AN EXISTING PRODUCT    </h3>    <p>      You can also develop products by Improving existing      products. As long as you contribute something to the      product in appearance, improve its functional performance,      or provide better marketing and distribution, you'll      succeed. However, simply doing something already done      without any improvement on your part will give the consumer      no compelling reason to purchase your product over one      already being marketed.    </p>    <p>      An example of a product improvement is the creation of      special pottery effects. Two things we've seen that are      impressive are studding plain unglazed earthenware with      sparkling metallic crystals, and using metallic glazes in      spring colors that are in definite contrast to the usual      earth tones found on pottery. These sell well in furniture      stores and boutiques that cater to decorators. The addition      of ceramic flowers to a vase made of pottery was an      attractive touch to help sell a plain vase. These and other      improvements to existing products can be both exciting and      lucrative.    </p>    <h3>      KEEP ABREAST OF WHAT'S GOING ON    </h3>    <p>      You should make an effort to go to places where you can get      ideas. It's very important that you see products similar to      yours, as well as products sharing the same theme. Take the      time to do the following:    </p>    <p>      Look at all applicable craft books available in craft and      hobby stores.<br />      Subscribe to craft or hobby magazines, or read them at your      local library.<br />      Go to gift sections of department stores.<br />      Ask people which items in your craft they prefer.<br />      Spend time In small boutiques.<br />      Wherever you go, talk to people and ask them about things      they might want (this includes people you sell to, friends,      and family).    </p>    <h3>      GO TO GIFT, TRADE, AND CRAFT SHOWS    </h3>    <p>      A show allows suppliers or craftsmen from many different      parts of the country to set up booths and show their wares.      These shows will give you an opportunity to find out the      latest developments In your particular skill, and will give      you product ideas. The people who display at these shows      can provide a wealth of Information and ideas. They also      may be helpful in:    </p>    <p>      Teaching you now techniques in your craft<br />      Giving you names of suppliers<br />      Giving you names of places to sell your products<br />      Telling you about other craft shows.<br />    </p>    <h3>      DEVELOP PRODUCT LINES    </h3>    <p>      Once you've developed new product ideas, there are some key      issues to keep in mind. Don't limit yourself to just one      Item. Select several related Items, in order to develop a      product line. For example, If you fabricate resin trivets,      also make spoon rests, napkin holders, coasters, and so on.      People like to buy things in groups. This includes both      consumers and store buyers. Buying in groups saves people      time, and It requires that they make fewer decisions. The      buyer will save time when he writes an order for several      Items from one company. And If he eliminates an item from      your product line, you still have something left to sell      him. THE MORE VARIETY YOU SHOW IN STYLES, SIZES, AND      PRICES, THE MORE CHANCES YOU'LL HAVE TO MAKE A SALE.    </p>    <h3>      PRICING YOUR PRODUCT    </h3>    <p>      Pricing your product correctly is an important part of your      business. It your price is too low you may lose money on      each article you sell. On the other hand, if the price is      too high you may lose sales. So every product you make and      plan to sell should be carefully priced.    </p>    <p>      Two methods which will help you are market pricing and cost      pricing. The market price is the sum that the product will      command In the marketplace. This price is also known as      "what the market will bear". In cost pricing, the value of      the product is the accumulation of all production and      distribution costs. These costs include material, labor,      selling expenses, cost of facilities, packaging, shipping,      and profit.    </p>    <h3>      HOW TO FIND THE MARKET PRICE    </h3>    <p>      The way to determine a market price is to fabricate      prototype samples and let several people-who you think      would buy your product -evaluate it. For example, If your      product is a baby item, ask some mothers and grandmothers      what they would pay for this item in a store. Be sure to      get a wide cross section of buying personalities. Most      marketing research corporations do exactly this type of      canvassing for their own products. The opinions of ten of      your friends, acquaintances, and shopkeepers will yield      information that is almost as accurate as what you'd obtain      from professional market survey. After all, a professional      survey simply records the opinions of a sampling of the      population with respect to a given product or service.      You-essentially-can do the same.    </p>    <p>      You must actively seek out pricing Input from people. Don't      be afraid to ask what they think, how much they'll pay, and      whether they have any comments about your product. Don't      lose your enthusiasm and self-determination If you get a      few negative responses. Once you get responses from several      people, you'll be surprised at the accuracy of your survey.    </p>    <h3>      DETERMINING THE COST PRICE    </h3><p>The best way to show the need for cost pricing is    through an example of one of our own experiences. Until we    conducted this exercise, we were losing money. The product    was a baby's bib which was handmade and cut in the shape of a    rabbit out of a terry-cloth backing. The face of the rabbit    was sewn on in applique. A cotton border trim was sewn around    the edge, with excess trim being extended and finished as the    tie string. Also on the bib was an applique orange felt    carrot, which the rabbit was eating. The cost breakdown for    this article is shown below.</p>          <h3>      HOW WE STOPPED LOSING MONEY    </h3>    <p>      We started asking our I friends and store-owners what they      would pay (retail) for this bib. To our amazement the      answers were all in agreement. The market price was      determined through this study to be $3.60 retail. Having to      sell a $3.88 bib for $3.60 and only making $1.00 per hour      for labor caused us to drop this item from our product      line. This Is the type of cost analysis that you should do      for every item in your line. We found that a reasonable      sales "commission" for the time one spends seeing a buyer      should be 15-33%. We also found that a reasonable profit is      33% of the sum of materials, labor, selling, and overhead      costs. Some artists price their articles by multiplying the      cost of materials by three, but this method didn't work for      us because labor is such a big portion of our product cost.    </p>    <h3>      REALITY IN PRICING    </h3>    <p>      You have to consider reality In your pricing. Ask yourself      if your work stands up to the competition of similar work      done by others. If it does, can you realistically add all      of the costs together and still make a profit? It may      surprise you to know that it may take two to three hours of      your time to pack and ship a $100.00 order. If you make      only a small profit on an individual item, will it still be      worthwhile if you're asked to make this Item In large      quantities? Don't forget that most retailers must add 100%      to make their profit. The $1.00 Item you sell to the store      will have to sell for $2.00. Will your product sell at      double your own asking price?    </p>    <h3>      THE COST OF "FOUND" MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      Don't forget that your time is money. Materials not bought      with cash still cost you money If you spend time looking      for them. If you use shells from the beach, old tin cans,      or dried flowers that you pick yourself, you should      calculate the cost of these "found" materials based on your      hourly wage. Figure how many items can be collected in an      hour and divide that Into your wage to find out the price      per piece. Include this in your figures when pricing a      product.    </p>    <h3>      WHAT HOURLY WAGE SHOULD YOU PAY YOURSELF?    </h3>    <p>      If you plan to work at your craft yourself, and never hire      anyone to replace you, you should pay yourself an hourly      wage competitive with those of comparable artists. If,      however, you plan to replace yourself at a task, pay      yourself the wage you would pay hired help. Be sure your      hourly wage doesn't make your product cost more than the      market price.    </p>    <h3>      YOUR HOURLY WAGE IS DIFFERENT FROM YOUR PROFIT    </h3>    <p>      Profit is over and above the cost of labor, materials,      selling costs, and overhead. At first you may hope to just      meet expenses or possibly your labor costs, but if you are      to expand your business you'll need to figure in a profit      to make It worthwhile. You may experiment with a 33% profit      as shown in the previous example. The profit percentage you      use will depend on your product and on existing economic      conditions.    </p>    <h3>      WATCH OUT FOR THE HIDDEN COSTS IN YOUR OVERHEAD    </h3>    <p>      Overhead includes all the hidden costs of a business: a      secretary, stationery, utility bills, time spent creating      and designing your products, etc. After a while you'll be      able to arrive at a realistic percentage to charge for      overhead. Careful records of your expenses and of time      spent in tasks not directly related to product fabrication      will help you in this area.    </p>    <h3>      PRICING FOR HIGH PROFIT    </h3>    <p>      The secret of making high profits Is to have an actual      retail price (the sum marked on your product In the store)      that is somewhere between the market price and your own      calculated retail price. Selling a product at an actual      retail price which is lower than the market price helps      ensure high sales. Having an actual retail price above the      calculated retail price ensures that you're making money.      You should try to get at least one product in your line      which has a high profit for you, because that product alone      will handle some of the overhead costs we all overlook in      pricing our products. At the same time you should have an      item with a lower Prof. It margin that produces quick      turnover. The rapid sales of this item will help to      encourage sales of other items with higher profit margins      and will keep cash flowing into your business.    </p>    <h3>      PRICING FOR CHANGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS    </h3><p>There's an old saying: "Make hay while the sun shines."    This saying ho Id be taken literally in your pricing    policies. When economic times re good and people seem to just    "buy anything", push your prices upward a little bit and make    some extra profit. You'll find that your sales will be    greatly affected by economic conditions. The extra profit you    make in good times might be just what you need to keep you    afloat when things get slow. In slow times you might be    forced to reduce your prices to maintain even minimum sales.</p>    <p>      A GOOD RULE TO REMEMBER: IN GOOD ECONOMIC TIMES, PRICE YOUR      ITEMS ACCORDING TO MARKET PRICING, BUT IN BAD TIMES KEEP      PROFITS AT A MINIMUM LEVEL TO KEEP SALES UP.    </p>    <h3>      REVIEW YOUR PRICES OFTEN    </h3>    <p>      Remember that pricing must be reviewed periodically to      reflect changes in hired help, material costs, overhead      costs, and economic conditions.    </p>
