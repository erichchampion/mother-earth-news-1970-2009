                <p>      "There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,/There is a      rapture on the lonely shore,<br />      / There is society, where none intrudes,/ By the deep sea,      and music in its roar:/ I love not Man the less, but Nature      more" (Byron)<br />    </p>        <p>      <em>The first of our long-awaited Environmental Hall of      Fame selections ?-based on suggestions from MOTHER 's      readers and voted upon by her editors-have been made!      By the end of this</em> <em>year, we'll have chosen a total      of 7.3 individuals whom we esteem for the work each did to      further the protection and preservation of the planet's      natural environment. (That's one selection for each year      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> has been published ... and we'll add      another honoree each year hereafter.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Of course, in addition to their appearance in the pages      of this magazine, these true firiends of the earth will be      honored in commemorative displays that are now being set up      at our beautiful Eco- Village. It's a small tribute,      indeed, because the good that these men and women have      accomplished has benefited us all ... and -under the      guardianship of each of us-will continue to serve      future generations.</em>    </p>        <p>      Audubon was born on the island of Haiti, arid was later      educated in Paris. There, he studied under David, who was      then recognized as the principal French artist of the      Revolutionary period. By 1820, while still a student,      Audubon began the task that was to consume the rest of his      life: imitating nature with brush and paint.    </p>    <p>      For years, he trekked through the North American wilderness      . . . collecting bird specimens and doing field sketches      that were later used as a basis for his incredibly detailed      illustrations of the various avian species. All in all,      Audubon completed an astonishing 1,065 full-sized paintings      of North American birds. Those portraits make up his      classic, <em>The Birds of America,</em> which was published      in four separate volumes between 1827 and 1838. This      masterwork was accompanied by Audubon's exceptional      <em>Ornithological Biography . . . in</em> which the artist      created ''word pictures'' to describe the wilderness      settings through which he'd journeyed.    </p>    <p>      Audubon also dreamed of crossing the American continent on      foot in order to catalog the nation's mammals as      exhaustively as he had its birds. The product of that      effort is <em>The Viviparous Quadrupeds of North      America,</em> completed by this great man's sons after his      death.    </p>        <p>      Henry David Thoreau, one of the Transcendental philosophers      of Concord, Massachusetts, had a special love for nature .      . . and kept journals of his excursions to the Maine woods,      the White Mountains, the Catskills, Cape Cod, Canada, and      the Upper Mississippi. Ironically, though, his most famous      "expedition'' was that to Walden Pond, which was a scant      two miles from Concord Center. There he lived in solitude      for two years, setting down the notes arid thoughts that      make tip the wonderful observations in <em>Walden</em>      (published in 1854).    </p>    <p>      Thoreau's writings introduced a new genre to American      literature: the nature essay. A gentle man who cared about      the suffering of animals, this New England poet/naturalist      was not a sportsman, nor did he collect specimens or hunt.      Instead, lie wrote about his intellectual and spiritual      relationship to what he saw. He was also a staunch      individualist who sought self-sufficiency, a simpler      lifestyle, and a harmonious coexistence with nature.    </p>        <p>      In 1868, John Muir arrived in California (after      <em>walking</em> through the Midwest!). There, in the      wilderness of the Yosemite Valley, he spent six years      studying, writing journals, and making sketches of what he      saw. Following that adventure, this rugged naturalist went      on to explore Nevada, Utah, the Northwest and Alaska.    </p>    <p>      Glaciers and forests -re two of Muir's chief interests, and      his research uncovered 65 glaciers in the Sierra . . .      supporting the then-unproven theory that its ranges were      formed by ice and not by the surrounding earth's collapse.      Subsequently, Muir was largely responsible for the      development of Yosemite National Park in 1890. He also      founded the Sierra Club and-as its first president-lobbied      actively for 22 years for the passage of conservation laws.    </p>    <p>      John Muir became the most notable turn-of-the-century      spokesman for the wilderness. Unlike most of his      contemporaries-who felt nature was a menace to be      subdued-Muir found supreme value in the untouched world's      capacity to serve as a teacher and a spiritual force. In      his books on wilderness living, his hardships are colored      by adventure and his adventures exalted by spiritual      communion,    </p>        <p>      "Teddy" Roosevelt is often credited with being the first      national political figure to bring the issue of      conservation to the attention of the American public.      Acting on his concerns for the efficient, economical use of      natural resources <em>and</em> for wilderness preservation,      Roosevelt established the federal Bureau of Land      Reclamation . . . had the Grand Canyon designated as one of      16 national parks . . and added some 194 mil <em>lion</em>      acres to this country's system of forest preserves.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, this President's conservation policies were      motivated by his own love for wilderness recreation. Teddy      was an enthusiastic field naturalist (as well as an avid      bird-watcher) and was recognized by a number of his      contemporaries as one of the authorities of the day on      nature studies. Also, although he opposed the wholesale      slaughter of wild creatures by commercial hunters, he      considered hunting for sport or food-on an      <em>individual</em> level-to be an integral part of the      wide range of worthwhile wilderness activities. Because      Roosevelt was, in addition to all of this, a talented and      prolific writer on wilderness themes, his lively reports of      his own expeditions must have given many city-bound      Americans of that time their first hint of the beauty and      grandeur of the great outdoors.    </p>        <p>      As a marine biologist, Rachel Carson combined her sense of      nature's poetry with scientific observations of minute      life-forms and the interface of ocean and shore to make      these things come alive for us in <em>Under the Sea-      Wind</em> (1941), <em>The Sea Around Us (1951),</em> and      <em>The Edge of the Sea</em> (1955).    </p>    <p>      In her most famous work, <em>Silent Spring</em> (1962),      Carson turned her incisive eye to humanity's impact on the      world. This study resulted in a powerful and terrifying      statement about the unconsidered effects of a greedy and      irresponsible industrial society. As she pointed out all      too clearly, pesticides were already threatening our water,      soil, and air while food additives and toxic chemicals were      endangering our own and many other species. By vividly      revealing the degree of contamination on our planet, Rachel      Carson opened America's mind to ecological awareness and      gave rise to the modern environmental movement.    </p>
