                        <h3>A BEGINNING AEROBICS WORKOUT</h3>                <p> <strong>Adele Greenfield (and MOTHER's staff)</strong><br />    <br />    It seems that people from all walks of life are joining the    burgeoning ranks of aerobic exercisers. Just look around!    City parks are crowded with noon-hour runners...living rooms    are reverberating with the grunts and groans of men and women    taking up the challenge of the Jane Fonda Workout...and    exercise studios of every description (with programs that run    the gamut from common sense to unproven theory) are crammed    with folks in search of fitness.<br />    <br />    Of course, aerobics isn't the only (or even a complete) route    to good health and extra energy ... but creating such an    exercise routine for yourself is an excellent way to start    down the road to a healthier, more fulfilling (and perhaps    even longer) life. And once you get yourself moving on a    regular basis, you might just find that your other habits    will improve also. However, I think it's best to consider the    health benefits as a bonus ... because aerobic exercise is    first, foremost, and primarily fun!<br />    <br />    <strong>WHAT IS AEROBICS?</strong><br />    <br />    Simply put, aerobic means "with oxygen". ,Aerobic exercise,    then, is any type of vigorous, and extended, activity (such    as running, swimming, dancing, etc.) that tends to increase    the efficiency with which the body takes in and utilizes    oxygen. It's also isotonic, which means that it typically    works the large muscle groups in unison ... as opposed to    isometric exercises, which build body strength by forcing    muscles to function in opposition to each other for short    periods of time. Nonstop aerobic movement causes the lungs    and heart to constantly pump life-sustaining oxygen through    the blood, andby toning the muscles and heartcan help you    develop both strength and endurance.<br />    <br />    As a stress-management consultant (and an enthusiastic    exerciser myself) I'm a true aerobics aficionado ... not only    because I believe this type of movement provides a proven    avenue to physical Fitness, but also because I feel that it    offers a viable means of releasing emotional tension and,    therefore, increasing mental concentration. However, no form    of exercise will let you achieve a self-sustaining plateau of    fitness. Getting and staving in shape requires a lifetime    commitment! Most people, though, discover that - once    they start working out on a regular basisthey soon enjoy    exercising so much (and it becomes such an important part of    their daily routine) that giving it up begins to seem    downright unthinkable!<br />    <br />    <strong>PICK A PROGRAM</strong><br />    <br />    When contemplating which sort of aerobic activity you'd like    to take up (and there are many,), first consider the needs of    your body, and then think about what sort of exercise you'd    most enjoy doing. For instance, if you have a weak back and    you like water sports, why not take up swimming? It will    probably be full and will help strengthen your sacroiliac    (whereas jogging could jar your back, making exercising so    painful that you'd soon abandon it).<br />    <br />    While deciding on a program, keep in mind that aerobic    fitness depends upon your increasing your heart rate. And in    order to keep that ticker thumping strong, you've got to work    your body hard and fast for at least 20 minutes at a stretch,    and do so three or more times a week. Of course, if you're    unused to strenuous exercise, you'll need to build up to it    over a couple of weeks or months and be patient with    yourself. (Also, should you have any question about your    health, be sure to check with your doctor before you begin a    routine.) In general, though, if you listen to your body,    it'll tell you when you're pushing too hard (or not hard    enough!), and you'll be able to react accordingly.<br />    <br />    And in order to understand your body's language, you'll have    to determine your maximum heart rate (that is, how fast the    organ is capable of beating) ... then compute the target    training zone for your heart (how fast it can beat safely)    ... and, finally, aim for that target zone during your    workout.<br />    <br />    At birth, your heart had a "top speed" of roughly 220 beats a    minute. On the average, this' rate decreases one beat with    each year of life. So, to determine your present maximum    heart rate (MHR), subtract your age from 220. If you're 30,    then, your MHR would be 190. Any more thumps and you're    asking for trouble. Ideally, strenuous exercise will push    your heart rate up to a target training zone of about 70% to    85% of its MHR. That figure, for our hypothetical    30-year-old, would be between 133 and 162 beats per minute    (190 X 0.7 = 133 and 190 X 0.85 = 162).<br />    <br />    The simplest way to monitor your heart rate is to take your    pulse ... and you should do this every few minutes during    your workout, to make sure you're not over- or underexerting    yourself. To check your heartbeat, grasp your left wrist with    your right hand and find your pulse (below your left thumb)    with the fingers (not the thumb) of your right hand. Now,    checking the second hand of your watch, count the number of    throbs you feel (through your sensitive fingertips) in ten    seconds, and multiply that figure by six to compute the beats    per minute. (Note: Although some folks prefer reading the    neck pulse, I've found that the wrist gives a more accurate    figure.)<br />    <br />    Now that you've chosen an aerobic activity (and know how to    monitor your heart rate so you can perform that exercise at    the optimum level), you're just about ready to hop into a    sweat suit or leotard and get moving!<br />    <br />    <strong>WHEN THE GOING GETS TOUGH...</strong><br />    <br />    However, before beginning your workout program, it's vitally    important that you make a commitment to [1] never, for any    reason -except injury or illness, of coursetalk yourself out    of exercising! ... and [2] spend five to ten minutes    stretching and warming up before starting a strenuous    routine. This second rule (and, believe me, both of these are    of great importance) is necessary because, if you don't take    the extra time to warm up your body and get your blood    flowing and your muscles limber, you'll be laying yourself    wide open to injury during the rigorous part of your    workout.<br />    <br />    After you've warmed up, though, you can dive into your    aerobics with gusto! Really work that body! Throw everything    you've got into each movement, and get your pulse rate up to    target! And don't stop exercising until you've danced the    full 20-minute routine, swum the 30 laps, run the entire    three miles ...or attained whatever reasonable goal you set    for yourself. Also, don't forget to check your pulse rate    frequently. If it's too fast, lower the intensity of your    movements, but if it's too slow, leap higher ... swim harder    ... run faster! As workout guru Jane Fonda says, "Go for the    burn!"<br />    <br />    Then, when you're finished, don't flop down on the grass    right away. Instead, take another eight minutes or so to cool    down (stretch and move about slowly to allow your pulse to    return to its usual rate and to make sure that blood won't    pool in your legs). Once your systems are back to normal    (when your pulse rate is below 100), you can reach for the    Gatorade or hop into the shower!<br />    <br />    <strong>THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT!</strong><br />    <br />    Aerobics probably won't (despite the claims made by some    spas) help you fall in love or put money in your pocket ...    but the act of developing (and maintaining!) a challenging    and realistic fitness routine for yourself can help you    become stronger physically and more alert mentally ... making    you more ready to really enjoy life's pleasures-and to handle    its pressureswhen they come your way. And just think, you can    achieve all this for the small price of huffing and puffing    three times a week.<br />    <br />    So get out there and join the ranks of aerobics enthusiasts.    It's fun! And besides, you've got nothing to lose (well, a    few inches maybe) ... and you have a healthy. heart and a    lifetime of vitality-to gain!		</p>      <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS ABOUT AEROBIC EXERCISE</h3>        <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> Will I lose weight?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Maybe. It depends-in Parton what, and      how much, you're eating. If you combine exercise with      sensible dietary habits, chances are that Your weight will      normalize. However, muscle weighs more than fat, so - you      could actually wind zip gaining ... but if inches go away      and Your body firms lip, why worry about what the scales      say?    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> Do I need a doctor's permission to      start exercising?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Opinions vary. The general consensus is      that, if you're in good health, you'll probably without      seeking your physician's OK. Bill if your health is poor      (and especially if You have any history of heart problems)      its best to talk with your doctor so he or she call help      you determine the best way for you to get in shape.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> How can I protect my joints during      exercise?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Wear well-constructed shoes that are      specifically designed for the activity you plan to take lip      (running shoes for jogging, aerobic dance shoes for indoor      aerobics, and so forth). And be sure to bandage any weak      joints for support. Also, if you're 40 pounds or more      overweight, take zip walking first ... in order to shed a      Jew pounds before you add more bounce to Your Program.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> Will aerobics help improve my      performance at work?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Yes! Studies have shown that those      folks who exercise hard for 30 to 45 minutes three times a      week are more productive on the job than nonexercisers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> Will aerobics help me to better handle      stress?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Again - yes! A s you improve your      strength and stamina, you'll also increase your tolerance      for stress. For one thing, continuous energetic movement      causes the brain to secrete beneficial chemicals known us      endorphins ("morphine within") into the system, and these      help create feelings of well-being, whichin turncan      alleviate depression, anxiety, and fatigue.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Q:</strong> When can I expect to see results from      an exercise program?    </p>    <p>      <strong>A:</strong> Within three weeks your fitness level      should improve, and after four to six - you'll be      exercising with case! (Your resting pulse rate may even be      lower than it was before you took tip aerobics, but that      only means that Your body, is working more efficiently.)    </p>
