                <p>     <em>Are you looking for      a profitable alternative to conventional agriculture that      can be practiced with very little land? Maybe your answer      is</em> ...    </p>            <hr />        <p>      <strong>W</strong> hen most people think of farming,      visions of fields of corn or pastures dotted With contented      cows probably come to mind. And when those same folks talk      about agricultural profitability, the conversation likely      tends to turn to bushels per acre, tons of silage, and the      continual gambles upon rain and frost. However, when      MOTHER's own Rick Compton thinks about farming these days      (and he's already been the <em>usual</em> route), his mind      dwells upon flows in gallons per minute, pH, oxygen      content, and conversion ratios. Why? Because since the      first of June 1983, Rick's "flock" has consisted of about      1,700 pounds of rainbow trout <em>(Salmo gairdneri      kamloops),</em> which he's raised from fingerlings (130 of      them to the pound) in four small man-made ponds at MOTHER's      EcoVillage Research Center.<br />      <br />      In a few weeks, when the processor arrives to pick up those      fish that have reached a mature 14 ounces, we'll receive      about $ 1.85 per pound for trout that cost only 60c a pound      to raise. What's more, other fish will be sold to      Eco-Village anglers at the standard area catch-out pond      price of $1.85 per pound. Naturally, it wasn't Rick's sole      intent to turn a profit (though it looks as if he'll manage      it). Rather, he had hoped to demonstrate a type of      aquaculture that can provide a tidy supplementary income in      a small space ... or, on a larger scale-if you'll      pardon the pun-provide an excellent means of making a      living!    </p>    <h3>      ON THE MENU    </h3>    <p>      You might be surprised to know that about 95% of the      11,000,000 pounds of rainbow trout eaten in the United      States each year is raised commercially. Since 1900, when      fish culture began to be recognized as a viable business,      many advances have been made in breeding and growing      methods ... in fact, "commercial" trout are now generally      acknowledged to be at least equal (in taste and texture) to      their wild counterparts. And of course, without      aquaculture-in the form of our hatchery system-the meager      productivity of natural waters would have resulted in      trout's being a rare and expensive delicacy (if not a      nearly extinct species) as a consequence of      over-fishing.<br />      <br />      Trout farming is most popular along a portion of the      spring-fed Snake River in Idaho until very recently, 90% of      the trout raised in the U.S. came from that spectacular      32-mile-long stretch-but it's now being practiced      successfully in Arkansas, northern Georgia, New Jersey,      North Carolina, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, and Washington, as      well. There are likely other areas where the required      clean, cool (but not too cold), and abundant water is      available, however. Indeed, once you have a general      knowledge of the necessary conditions, you may discover      that <em>your</em> area is "ripe" for an experimental fish      farm.    </p>    <h3>      IT'S THE WATER    </h3>    <p>      Rainbow trout (which are usually preferred for intensive      growing over the other varieties) are an amazingly hardy      breed, but if you're to have the most <em>productive</em>      ponds possible, you'll need to provide your fish with the      right environment. Once past the fingerling size, rainbows      grow most rapidly when the water temperature stays in the      550 to 580F range. (They can survive down to about 34 or up      to around 70', but their enzymatic systems will be upset,      and their growth will halt long before those deadly levels      are reached.)<br />      <br />      Temperature also influences the amount of oxygen that water      can hold, so an overly warm pond imposes a double threat.      In fact, water at 39Â°F can hold about 12.9 parts per      million (ppm) at saturation, while at 680F it can maintain      only 9 ppm. Since rainbows begin to become distressed at      oxygen levels of below 6 ppm, and will die at 3 ppm, cooler      water provides a much greater margin of safety.      Furthermore, in a "stair step" pond system like Rick's, if      the oxygen level of liquid entering the course is only 9      ppm, there's a much greater chance that the fish in the      upper ponds will use so much oxygen that those in the lower      pools will suffocate. This problem <em>can</em> be eased by      including aeration devices along the way. For example, Rick      installed splashboards made from corrugated fiberglass      (with holes drilled in them) at the downstream end of each      of our ponds, and made sure that the entry line at the top      of each tank was angled up at 45 degrees to create      splashing. Finally, altitude is yet another factor that      comes into play with oxygen content, since the saturation      level of water declines about 0.5 ppm for every 1,000 feet      above sea level.<br />      <br />      Of course, the ponds used for trout aquaculture must also      be kept very clean. Kamloops are sensitive to      concentrations of zinc as low as 0.04 ppm, an amount that      could result from the use of galvanized piping. For that      reason, only plastic or aluminum conduits are used in trout      farming. The fish can also be adversely affected by the      runoff from any fertilizers or pesticides that might be      used by farmers on sites above pond location(s). In      general, spring- or well water is considered best-simply      because it's much less susceptible to contamination than is      a major surface watercourse-but there <em>are</em> cautions      to be observed when using liquid from even those relatively      <em>pristine</em> sources. Iron bacteria found in the      groundwater, for example, can accumulate on the gills of      the fish, reducing their ability to breathe.<br />      <br />      Hardness and pH are two additional factors that, while both      important, can be somewhat at odds with each other. Trout      absorb very few minerals through their gills, so the      nutritional advantages of hard water are of little benefit      to them. Furthermore, water with only a small mineral      content has more ability to hold oxygen, so the dissolved      oxygen content in soft water is typically greater.      Actually, were it not for the lack of pH-buffering      capability of mineral-poor water, the low-hardness liquid      would <em>always</em> be preferred. However, should a      low-pH rain squall (perhaps one that's been acidified by      airborne pollution) drain into the stream supplying a pond      with soft water, the liquid could become so acidic that the      fish would be injured (or killed). Several major kills      have, in fact, occurred in the southern Appalachians, and      only prompt and thorough liming of the water (to raise the      pH level) can ward off the disastrous results of the soft      water/low-pH rain combination.<br />      <br />      The final environmental prerequisite for successful trout      farming is an ample <em>amount</em> of water. Here in      western North Carolina, we've found that we can grow about      eight pounds of fish for each gallon per minute (GPM) of      flow. If we had only one pond, then, we'd be limited to a      total of 480 pounds at our minimum flow of 60 GPM. Because      we have four tanks linked in series (with      oxygen-replenishing spillways in between), however, our      total crop could approach 2,000 pounds! As we've already      suggested, though, the carrying capacity of a gallon of      water depends on temperature, hardness, dissolved oxygen      content, and other factors ... so each<br />      <br />      region has its own limitations on the number of pounds that      can be grown per GPM of flow. (Pennsylvania, for example,      can support about four pounds per GPM, while the most      successful Idaho ponds have pushed 20 pounds per GPM.) If      there's <em>enough</em> flow, however, the total production      can still be quite high ... even if the water itself has a      low carrying capacity.    </p>    <h3>      THE FACILITY    </h3>    <p>      MOTHER's trout ponds are supplied by a small, spring-fed      tributary stream that feeds into the Eco-Village lake. Rick      measured the flow over a weir (a standard flow-measuring      device) for a year, combined those figures with less formal      observations that he'd made during the four years he's      worked at EcoVillage, and decided he'd be safe if he      figured on a minimum flow of 60 GPM. (At certain periods of      the year, the volume of water is many times that amount,      but since he's raising fish that take about a year to      mature, it's important that he not run short during the dry      months.)<br />      <br />      At the point where the creek emerges from the woods,      MOTHER's crew built a dam that's approximately five feet      tall, forming a pond about 20 feet wide and 30 feet long. A      spillway and standpipes allow the excess water to run      downstream, while the 60 GPM flow is diverted through a      six-inch PVC pipe fitted with a flow restrictor. The pipe      runs a little ways downhill (and to the north of the creek      bed) before entering a 900-gallon rectangular concrete      tank. This uppermost tank is the home for the      hatchery-bought fingerlings ... as many as 3,000 of them at      a time!<br />      <br />      Water leaves the bottom of the first pond, passes over an      aerating spillway, and flows downhill a few more feet-in      another six-inch PVC pipe-to the second container.<br />      <br />      This pond (along with the two below it) was simply      excavated from the gradually sloping hillside and lined      with gravel to keep silt down. Concrete is used only to      form the spillway at the lower end. You see, when the tiny      new fish are brought in, it's much easier to "herd" them in      a square tank with smooth sides. But as they grow, they can      be netted and moved easily enough in a simple earthen pond.      Rick says that many people feel that trout grown in a      dirt-and-gravel pool taste better, and have flesh of a more      pleasant color, though the graveled bottoms <em>are</em> a      bit more difficult to keep clean.<br />      <br />      The second and third ponds contain 900 gallons each, but      the last pool holds approximately 1,100 gallons, and thus      is large enough to accommodate the <em>market-sized</em>      trout living at the lowest point in the chain.      (Incidentally, the larger a Kamloop grows, the more      tolerant it is of adverse temperature hygienic, and oxygen      conditions.) Finally, from the fourth pond the water      returns to the creek, which is dammed up one more time for      our catch-out pond.<br />      <br />      Rick uses a net and a "grader box" to sort the fish as they      grow. Once the trout reach a size that prevents them from      slipping through slats in the grader's wooden tray, they're      moved down to the next lower pond in the series. Then, when      the fish in tank four reach market size, the processor is      called in to pick up (and pay for) our crop.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CARE AND FEEDING</strong><br />      <br />      The occupants of each pond are fed a 38%protein commercial      feed twice a day, if the environmental conditions are      right. Should the water become too warm (or the oxygen      content drop too low), Rick may feed them only once a day      ... or even hold off for a couple of days. He says that      feeding has been one of the trickiest aspects of the      business to get the hang of, since the correct amount and      frequency can be learned only by experience.<br />      <br />      The size of the pellets that the trout receive is different      for each pond. Because we have only four pools, four feed      sizes serve us well, but larger, commercial operations      often use a series of six or more. Careful adjustment of      the diameter of the rations to the size of the fish causes      the finny crop to grow more rapidly, and reduces      waste.<br />      <br />      We're paying about 22c per pound for the Silver Cup fish      feed Rick uses, and we get back about a pound of trout for      every two pounds of food. This two-to-one proportion is      called the conversion ratio, and any figure <em>lower</em>      than 2:1 is considered to be pretty darned good. The best      big-time operations approach 1.5:1, and 1.13:1 has been      achieved in a laboratory. (Obviously, a 1: 1 ratio would      imply complete conversion of food to trout, which is      impossible.) Of course, large fish farms (they may have as      many as ten acres of ponds) don't feed by hand. Instead,      they use automatic feeders that the fish themselves can set      off ... allowing the trout to take in as much as they      wish.<br />      <br />      One of the interesting business aspects of trout farming is      that the fish can go with very little food (for up to two      weeks at a time) <em>without</em> losing a significant      amount of weight. Thus, a grower can afford to wait two      weeks for the processor to arrive without having to      <em>waste</em> feed on the already market-sized fish. With      most other livestock, rations must be maintained usually at      no gain in potential income-simply to keep a critter at      market weight.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AILMENTS</strong>    </p>        <p>      As is the case with any intensively grown livestock,      rainbow trout <em>are</em> susceptible to diseases. So far      we've been lucky, but Rick has had to keep a watchful eye      out for a couple of problems. One, called "red mouth"      because of its major symptom, can bring about losses of      more than 30% if unchecked. The illness is usually picked      up at the hatchery, so it pays to keep different batches of      fingerlings separated in order to prevent healthy fish from      contracting the disease. Fortunately, red mouth can be      treated by mixing a small dose of Tetramycin in with the      feed. (Commercially prepared mixtures with 0.5 to 1.5      pounds of the antibiotic added to each 100 pounds of feed      are available, at an additional cost of $1.50 to $2.00 per      bag.)<br />      <br />      The other common ailment in our area is bacteria gill,      which ?again ?is often introduced to farming operations by      hatchery stock (it's particularly prevalent in those      hatcheries using hard well water). Amazingly enough, the      general cure for bacteria gill is to give the fish a salt      bath! If the trout are left in a 30% salt solution for      about 30 minutes, they'll come out with clean gills. (This      may sound like a strange treatment for freshwater fish, but      bear in mind that trout are Salmonids, and many of them are      anadromous ... that is, they migrate between fresh- and      salt water.)<br />      <br />      Each day, Rick checks for dead fish and for any that are      discolored or have bulging red eyes. With each mortality      (they average about one per week, usually from a condition      called egg lock), he tries to determine what killed the      fish. Should three or more trout die in one week, he'd      become concerned and might take a sample to a biologist to      determine the cause.<br />      <br />      Other daily chores include testing the water for      temperature, pH, oxygen content, hardness, and occasionally      for dissolved carbon dioxide. Rick uses a Hach Company      AL-36B kit to perform these examinations. Observation is      also an important part of tending the "flock". Contented      fish generally swim in a circle that faces them directly      into the flow of water during a portion of their orbit, and      if the trout are swimming about <em>erratically,</em> it's      a sure sign that they're agitated. Furthermore, about once      a month the algae have to be cleaned from the concrete pond      walls and bottoms and from the spillways. (So far, at      least, the spillways have shown the most      accumulation.)<br />      <br />      The construction of the four ponds cost just short of      $1,700, and we added a shed (for another $400) to house      food bags, nets, etc. If the farm can continue to produce      1,600 or more pounds of rainbows per year, the operation      should produce an annual cash flow of at least $1,760, and      possibly as much as $2,960. Operating expenses at that      volume should be around $1,000, so the net profit ought to      pay back the construction cost in no more than two and a      half years. From then on, a miniature fish farm like ours      could be expected to produce a tidy supplementary income      ... not to mention a mighty tasty meal from time to time!    </p>
