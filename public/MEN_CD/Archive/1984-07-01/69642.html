                    <h5 id="byline">      By Lyle E. Staab    </h5>    <p>      <em>You glide over crystal water, observing the many      life-forms in its depths. A delicateJ-    stroke silently propels your canoe round a gentle bend      in the river. Three deer-a doe and two fawnsstand knee-deep      in the water. They turn to look at you. Just as you draw      abreast of them, the doe signals her young, and all three      turn in unison and fade silently into the      underbrush.</em></p>      <p>      <em>In the bow, your mate knifes a paddle into the      water, and you match that stroke with yours. The canoe      picks up speed, and you use your paddle as a rudder to      guide it through a fast riffle. Another bend in the river,      and you come upon a long-legged crane standing and spearing      fish with its beak in the shallows. It sees you and flushes      with a powerful flapping of wings, emitting loud, echoing      squawks that send a small flock of colorful ducks      sailing off downstream in front of      you.</em></p>      <p>      <em>The sun begins to set, and you beach your craft and      make camp for the evening. Later,sometime between      the first "jug-a-rum "of the frogs announcing the stealthy      approach of darkness and the last soulful taste of      charboiled fresh trout, vague worries of job pressures and      subway schedules surface in your mind. But these thoughts      pass quickly; you'll deal with them later...      much later. For now, you put out the Coleman lantern,      snuggle down into your sleeping bag beside your already      snoozing mate...and let the gentle      night rhythms of the river and its creatures lull you into      peaceful, dreamless sleep.</em>    </p>
