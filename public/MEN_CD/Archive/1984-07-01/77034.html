                    <p>      <strong>A 1-MEGAWATT "WINDWALL" IS PLANNED FOR CALIFORNIA'S      ALTAMONT PASS.</strong> A double strand      of 70-kilowatt turbines, strung along a prestressed cable,      will be stretched across a valley site to catch incoming      winds. According to its designers, the innovative system      will capture six to ten times as much energy as      conventional tower-mounted machines in the same amount of      space ... and will save money on support structures, as      well.</p>      <p>      <strong>CHEMICAL SOUP INDEED! CYANIDE, URANIUM, MERCURY,      AND PLUTONIUM</strong> -and at least 136 other      dangerous chemicals and radioactive substances-were      found in creek sediments near Oak Ridge, Tennessee, during      a study conducted for the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA).      The Department of Energy's (DOE) nearby Y-12 plant, which      produces enriched uranium components for nuclear weapons,      is believed to be the primary source of the contamination.      DOE is said to be "analyzing" the report.</p>      <p>      <strong>IF YOU SEE WHAT APPEARS TO BE A VERY LARGE PLAYING      CARD ON WHEELS</strong> rolling down a western highway,      it's probably just Joel Davidson or Greg Johanson in their      photovoltaic-powered speedster. Using 24 extra light      43-watt Arco Solar PV panels-mounted flat on a horizontal      platform-and a 1-horsepower electric motor, the vehicle is      expected to be capable of reaching unprecedented solar      speeds of between 38 and 45 MPH in full sun!</p>      <p>      <strong>SAY ''CHEESE'' AND TEAR UP YOUR UTILITY      BILLS.</strong> Foremost Dairies in Le moore, California,      has installed a unique system that converts cheese wastes      into enough biogas to meet all of the firm's energy needs.      Each day, the $2.3 million anaerobic digester will produce      400,000 cubic feet of 70%,to 80% pure methane from whey, a      by-product of cheese making. The first-of-its-kind system      is odor-free, needs only one-tenth the energy required to      operate a conventional (aerobic) plant of equivalent      capacity, and is expected to pay for itself in less than      two years.</p>      <p>      <strong>ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS ALTERNATIVE ENERGY      PROJECTS IN THE WESTERN HEMISPHERE</strong> has been      launched by wartorn Nicaragua's Sandinista government. The      destruction of one of the country's main fuel      depots-along with 135 million gallons of      petroleum-by CIA-backed "contra" forces last fall,      and greatly reduced oil shipments to the nation (which      produces no oil of its own) have prompted a plethora of      projects aimed at energy self-sufficiency. Among them are a      nationwide energy conservation and gas-rationing program      ... plans for five medium-size (17- to 350-megawatt)      hydropower plants ... three major biomass projects,      including one to gasify wood and cotton wastes into usable      fuel ... and construction of six 35-megawatt geothermal      plants (one of which is already operating) to employ the      heat from Nicaragua's active volcanoes to produce      electricity. The government is focusing specifically on      ways to decentralize its energy system so that power is      produced on a local basis, close to its users.</p>      <p>      <strong>ONLY ONE IN TEN LENDERS GIVES BUYERS OF      ENERGY-EFFICIENT HOMES PREFERENTIAL CONSIDERATION</strong>      when evaluating mortgage applications, according to a      survey conducted for Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation.      Nearly six in ten of those interviewed-primarily      presidents or vice presidents of banks or savings and loan      organizations-said they plan to offer such allowances      in the future ... but apparently the officials don't do so      now because they believe there's no reliable way to      evaluate a structure's efficiency. Recently, however, the      Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation cited several      available measurement programs (such as the National Home      Builders' Thermal Performance Guidelines, and the Virginia      and Maryland Home Builders' E-7 Program) in an effort to      encourage preferential loan treatment. Says Richard      Trumbull, vice president of Owen sCorning, ". . . with the      exception of a drop in interest rates, recognizing energy      efficiency in the mortgage lending process may be the best      way to help more Americans qualify for housing."</p>      <p>      <strong>"MOBILE BIOMASS HARVESTING UNITS" MAY SOMEDAY ROAM      THE RANGE</strong> of the American Southwest if a plan      being studied seriously by the federal government and      Arizona State University ever comes to fruition. The      machines would scavenge dense scrub and brush, grind the      material, and convert the pulp on the spot-through a      process known as indirect liquefaction-into diesel      fuel. A ton of foraged feedstock would yield 40 to 50      gallons of liquid gas, and the machines would be designed      to cut plants above their roots so that the vegetation      could grow back to provide still more fuel. The U.S. Forest      Service, which often must burn scrub in order to improve      grazing land and wildlife habitat (and to control      wildfires), sees special promise in the project.</p>      <p>      <strong>WISCONSIN HAS INSTALLED TWO SOLAR REST      STOPS</strong> on Interstate 43 near Green Bay, as a result      of the success of one such unit set up in 1979 along      I-90/94. The privies' collectors provide 50% of the heating      and hot water needed.... TIBET'S SOLAR POTENTIAL IS SECOND      ONLY TO THE SAHARA'S, say Chinese scientists, so they're      planning a wide-ranging program in the land of Shangri-la      to utilize the sun for heating sheep pens, growing      greenhouse vegetables, and generating electricity...      Plagued by power outages that have forced the facility to      close several times, THE GREATER PITTSBURGH AIRPORT MAY      SWITCH OVER ALMOST COMPLETELY TO HYDROPOWER within the next      two years if plans to build a generating plant on each of      two existing dams are implemented as expected... 7,000 COWS      WILL PROVIDE 420 TONS OF MANURE DAILY TO FEED A VERMONT      METHANE PLANT that-in turn-will fuel a      1-megawatt generating facility. Officials expect to get      "three to four kilowatts of electricity from each cow per      day."    </p>
