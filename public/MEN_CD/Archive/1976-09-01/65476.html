    <p>
                    <p>      If you're like most people, you probably don't think of      cacti-those spiny denizens of the desert-as      fruit-bearing plants. Bebe (Cactus Lady) Bruce says      "Think again! Some cacti live a long way from the dry      Southwest and bear luscious fruit that can be made into      jelly, wine, and many other products . . . all of which      have a definite market value!"    </p>        <p>      The opuntia-commonly called the prickly pear      cactus-is perhaps the best-known and best-loved      cactus in the world today. <em>Best-known because</em> it's      so widely distributed (you'll find opuntias from California      to Florida to Europe to the West Indies). Best-      <em>loved</em> because of the bountiful yield of pulpy,      red, deliciously tangy fruits-or "prickly      pears"-this cactus produces every fall.    </p>    <p>      My own love affair with the opuntia began one afternoon as      I was walking my dog down a dusty road outside the small,      west-Texas town to which I'd recently moved. At one point,      my canine friend stopped to sniff a ripe,      crimson-colored, half-eaten (by a bird) fruit that      had-apparently-fallen from a clump of cacti      growing out of a rocky ledge above the road.    </p>    <p>      Like a true city bumpkin I picked up the partially devoured      fruit, carried it home, showed it to my neighbor, and      asked: "Isn't this what folks use to make prickly pear      jelly?"    </p>    <p>      "Yep! Sure is," my friend replied. She then told me the      name of an elderly lady in a nearby community who made the      jelly and who could give me the recipe.    </p>    <p>      Thus began a prickly pear recipe collection that has since      swollen to include jam, preserves, pie, wine, and a vitamin      C-rich pear-juice "cooler", among others. My "romance" with      the prickly pear has turned out to be a long      and-well- <em>fruitful</em> one.    </p>    <h3>YOU CAN STALK THE PRICKLY PEAR</h3>    <p>      "Indian figs", as opuntias are sometimes called, are so      widely distributed throughout the U.S. that-chances      are-you'll have little trouble locating some near      where you live ... <em>if</em> you know how to look for      them.    </p>    <p>      The eastern prickly pear <em>(Opuntia vulgaris)</em> grows      in rocky and sandy habitats-especially near the      coast-from as far north as Massachusetts to the      southernmost reaches of Florida, and in between. The ovoid      pads of these cacti measure two to five inches in length,      and the whole plant is seldom more than a couple feet tall.      Likewise, the fruit is fairly tiny: only an inch to an inch      and a half long.    </p>        <p>      In contrast, the western prickly pear-0.      <em>rafinesquii</em> and other species-grows      considerably larger (a height of ten feet is not uncommon)      than <em>O. vulgaris</em> and produces one- to      five-inch-long "pears" which are shaped somewhat like Old      Spice after-shave bottles. These opuntias are found in      rocky and sandy areas from the Mississippi Valley to Ohio      and Michigan, west to British Columbia, south to (and      beyond) the Mexican border, and eastward as far as Texas      and Louisiana.    </p>    <p>      All opuntias bloom in the spring, at which time they're      covered by spectacular, waxy, yellow (sometimes red)      flowers which usually disappear after only a day. In the      fall, "pears" develop on the plant where blossoms occurred      in the spring, and the fruit is ready for harvest from late      September to-and through-October (and even into      November, in some locales).    </p>    <h3>HOW TO HARVEST PRICKLY PEARS</h3>    <p>      Rule Number One when foraging prickly pears is: Wear gloves      or use tongs to remove the pears from the plants. Don't go      after the fruit barehanded, and for heaven's sake      <em>don't</em> try to eat your pickin's in the field! (The      pears-true to their name-are covered with      clusters of highly irritating bristles, making it easier      than you think to wind up with sore hands-and sore      gums!-at the end of the day.)    </p>    <p>      Mature prickly pears are tawny green to blackish purple,      depending on the species. There's only one sure way to tell      if a fruit is ripe without tasting it, though ... and      that's to pick it off the cactus and examine the pear's      damaged end (where it was torn from the parent plant). If      the pulp is red at the rupture, you can be certain it's      ripe.    </p>    <h3>LET THERE BE JUICE</h3>        <p>      To make prickly pear jelly-or prickly pear anything,      for that matter-you've got to start with juice and/or      pulp. Let's talk about juice first.    </p>    <p>      Start with a quart of fresh-picked fruit and scrub the      pears under running water with a vegetable brush (use      tongs, unless want needles to come off in your hands).      Place the clean intact fruits in a large stew pot, cover      them with water and boil for half an hour ... then crush      the tender pears with a potato masher and strain the      resulting pulp through a cloth-lined collander. (Leftover      seeds, skins, and pulp be composted.) You should end up      with about 2-1/2 of juice.    </p>    <p>      To prepare pulp only, simply [1] skin the fresh, uncooked      pears, [2] slice each one in half lengthwise, and [3]scoop      out-with a knife, spoon, or thumb-as many seeds      can from the fleshy fruit halves before mashing them into      pulp.    </p>    <p>      Now you're ready to try your hand at "prickly pear cookery"      . . . and to discover for yourself how tasty the little      pear really is.    </p>    <h3>PRICKLY PEAR JELLY</h3>      <p>      If you're looking for a novel home business, you might want      to consider making-and selling-prickly pear      jelly. The sweet spread is already a popular novelty item      in the Southwest, where a two-ounce jar commands as much as      $1.00 at fruit stands, gift shops, grocery stores, county      fairs, craft shows, etc.    </p>    <p>      Regardless of whether or not you set up your own "jelly      works", however, I think you'll enjoy the distinctive      flavor of this delightful red biscuit and toast topping.    </p>    <p>      1 cup of prickly pear juice<br />      3 cups of sugar<br />      1/3 cup of lemon juice<br />      1/2 bottle (3 ounces) of Certo liquid pectin    </p>    <p>      Combine the prickly pear juice, the sugar, and the lemon      juice in a saucepan and bring the mixture to a boil. Add      the liquid pectin and boil again for two to three minutes.      (Note: Unless you're a syrup freak, I don't recommend using      a powdered pectin-such as Sure-Jell-in this      recipe.) Stir the liquid as it boils and be careful not to      let it bubble over. Timing is critical here: The longer you      let the juice mixture boil, the stiffer the jelly will be.    </p>    <p>      Finally, remove the pan from the heat, skim off any foam,      pour the liquid into sterilized jars, and seal them with      paraffin. Yield: 4 eight-ounce jars ... or 16 two-ounce      jars which can sell, as already noted, for $1.00 each.    </p>        <p>      PRICKLY PEAR PRESERVES    </p>    <p>      4 cups of prickly pear pulp<br />      3 cups of sugar<br />      the juice-and grated rind-of two medium      lemons<br />    </p>    <p>      Combine all three ingredients in a large saucepan, place      over low heat, and allow the combination to come to a boil.      Simmer the mixture-stirring frequently-for 1 to      1-1/2 hours, or until thick and clear. Pour into hot,      sterilized jars and seal.    </p>    <p>      PRICKLY PEAR PIE (VERSION 1)    </p>    <p>      This luscious dessert looks something like cherry pie, but      has a distinctive taste all its own. (And texture, too, if      you don't remove all the skins and seeds from the pulp!)    </p>    <p>      4 cups of prickly pear pulp<br />      1-1 /4 cups of sugar<br />      1 teaspoon of flour or cornstarch<br />      1 nine-inch pie shell pie crust dough    </p>    <p>      Preheat the oven to 350°. Stir the pulp, sugar, and      flour (or cornstarch) together thoroughly in a large mixing      bowl, then pour the mixture into the pie shell and      crisscross the shell with 1/2"-wide strips of pie crust      dough. Bake at 350° until the pie's cover is golden      brown and the filling is bubbling.<br />    </p>    <h3>PRICKLY PEAR PIE (VERSION 2)</h3>    <p>      This recipe differs from the one above-and, in fact,      from <em>most</em> pie recipes-in the kind of crust      used.    </p>    <p>      3-1/2 cups of prickly pear pulp<br />      1 cup of sugar<br />      1 cup of water<br />      1 stick of margarine or butter<br />      1 cup of flour<br />      1 cup of sugar (for crust)<br />      1 teaspoon of baking powder<br />      1/2 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 cup of milk<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla    </p>    <p>      Place the pulp, cup of sugar, and water in a saucepan and      boil (with stirring) until the sugar is completely      dissolved ... then remove from heat and set aside. (This      will be the filling.)    </p>    <p>      To prepare the crust, begin by putting the margarine (or      butter) in a large baking casserole and placing the      casserole- in turn-in the oven as it preheats      to 350°. Then, in a clean bowl, mix the flour, sugar,      baking powder, salt, milk, and vanilla together and pour      the resulting mixture-which should have the      consistency of pancake batter-into the hot casserole,      atop the melted margarine (DO NOT STIR). Then-in the      center of (and on top of) the crust mixture-pour the      filling. (Here again, DO NOT STIR.)    </p>    <p>      Now slide the whole works into the 350° oven. During      the baking period, the batter for the crust will actually      rise over and completely cover the pie's filling. (Don't      take my word for it . . . try it yourself!) The pie is done      when the crust is completely brown.    </p>    <h3>PRICKLY PEAR WINE</h3>        <p>      If you're a wine aficionado, you may already have one of      the many well-advertised winemaking kits now on the market      ... in which case you can follow its directions,      substituting prickly pear juice for grape "must". (The kit      should have a germicide for sterilizing glassware, yeast      packages, a hydrometer for determining sugar      concentrations, and just about anything else you'll      need-save a large crock or jug-to make your own      prickly pear wine.)    </p>    <p>      If you <em>don't</em> have any winemaking equipment and      you've never (purposely, at least) fermented anything in      your life, you can still put up an acceptable batch of      prickly pear vino using the recipe below.    </p>    <p>      2 gallons of prickly pear juice<br />      4-1/2 cups of sugar<br />      1 pack of yeast<br />      1 jar of water    </p>    <p>      Start by rounding up [1] a large, clean glass jug with a      tight-fitting cork or stopper, [2] a six-foot length of      surgical tubing, and [3] some household cement. Then, using      a sharp knife, ream a hole in the cork just large enough to      accommodate the tubing ... and insert the hose a      <em>short</em> distance into the hole and glue it in place.    </p>    <p>      Next, heat the prickly pear juice almost to boiling in a      large pot and dissolve the sugar in it. Afterwards, pour      (or siphon) all but a cup of the steaming juice into the      glass jug and allow it to cool until lukewarm, then      dissolve the yeast in the remaining cup of liquid and add      it to the fermentation vessel. Stopper the jug      tightly-cementing the plug in place, if necessary to      ensure an airtight seal-and run the free end of the      surgical tubing into a jar of water, as shown in the      accompanying diagram.    </p>    <p>      Now set the jug and jar in a cool place-60° to      70° F is fine-and wait. Within hours, bubbles      will begin to appear in the jar of water, indicating that      fermentation is taking place in the jug. The juice should      continue to ferment (and bubbles appear in the jar) for the      next three to six weeks, depending on the liquid's      temperature.    </p>    <p>      When bubbles have stopped coming out of the tubing, allow      the jug to sit undisturbed one more week <em>...</em> then      [1] siphon the wine into a sterile container (being careful      not to transfer sediment from the bottom of the      fermentation vessel), [2] thoroughly wash the big glass      jug, and [3] return the wine to it. (Stopper the vessel as      before and-again-run the hose into a jar of      water.)    </p>    <p>      After an additional week, siphon the wine into sterile      recycled wine bottles, seal the bottles with corks (you can      find the equipment you'll need to do this at any winemaking      supply shop, or you can order materials by mail from      Semplex of U.S.A., Box 12276, Minneapolis, Minn. 55412 and      set the whole batch in a cool, dark place to age. Leave the      young wine undisturbed for at least a month before sampling      it . . . longer, if you can stand the suspense!    </p>    <h3>PRICKLY PEAR COOLER</h3>    <p>      If alcohol isn't your cup of tea, you're sure to get a      natural "high" from the pure, unfermented juice of the      prickly pear. Try this: [1] Wash, skin, slice, and de-seed      some ripe pears, [2] chop the remaining flesh into small      pieces (there's no need to cook them), [3] throw the chunks      and slivers into the blender for a one- or two-minute whiz      at high speed, and [4] serve on the rocks. (You may find it      desirable to strain the nectar before drinking it,      particularly if you think that any seeds are lurking in the      red liquid.) If the beverage is too tangy for your taste,      dilute it with a small amount of water.    </p>    <h3>OTHER IDEAS</h3>      <p>      Prickly pears can be prepared in ways other than those I've      mentioned. For instance, the fruit's raw flesh is delicious      when cut into small pieces and eaten like strawberries      (with or without cream). Also, the tart little chunks make      a supertasty "surprise ingredient" in fruit salads and      gelatins. And they're positively scrumptious when mixed      with yogurt.    </p>    <p>      Even the fleshy pads of the mother plant can be cut into      pieces and eaten raw, boiled, or pickled. (These chunks are      called <em>nopales</em> and are eaten as a staple food by      members of many Mexican and American Indian families.)    </p>    <p>      Cook up some prickly pear jelly-or preserves, or      pie-and who knows? The scrubby, spine-studded opuntia      just may become <em>your</em> favorite cactus, too! And, if      you're in the market for a little extra spending money,      don't overlook the possibility of selling a few of your      creations. For fun and food-and profit!-I find      that prickly pears are hard to beat. That's why they call      me the Cactus Lady!    </p>
