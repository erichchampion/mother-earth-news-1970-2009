               <p>      <em>If you install a hand pump on your well, you can do      away with power-outage droughts.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">By Larry Pina</h5>    <p>      A few years back, a severe ice storm knocked out my      family's electricity for a couple of days . . . and we      suddenly found ourselves without the use of our well pump.      As we groped about the candlelit house-unable to make      coffee, prepare meals, wash dishes, flush the toilet, or      even take a sip of tap water (yet all the while keenly      aware that just 15 feet below us was all the thirst      quenching liquid we could ever want)-we felt like the      shipmates becalmed at sea in the "Rime of the Ancient      Mariner", with "water, water, everywhere, / Nor any drop to      drink"!    </p>    <p>      I remembered then that when I was a youngster one of our      neighbors had attached a working hand pump to his electric      well pump . . . and I wished I'd had the foresight and      know-how to install a similar fixture on our unit. I made      up my mind - then and there - to at least      <em>investigate</em> the possibility. It's fortunate that I      did, too, because putting a hand pump on our well turned      out to be an easy task (even for an amateur      do-it-yourselfer like me!).    </p>    <p>      And if you're looking for a low-cost, nonelectric backup      design for a "juice powered" pumping system, my solution      just might do the job for you!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE PUMPING PARTS</strong>    </p>    <p>      As shown in the accompanying diagram, our hand pump and its      related components are totally separate from the electric      unit. The two pumps merely share the same well casing (in      this instance, a 6"-diameter pipe that extends 125 feet      into the ground). In addition, because the water table is      only about 13 feet below the top of our well casing, we      were able to choose a simple, shallow-drawn hand pump for      our purposes rather than having to buy amore expensive,      deep-reaching machine. (To calculate the height of the      water table, I just lowered a string that had a small piece      of wood tied to the end of it into the well casing until      the wood floated and the string went slack, and then I      marked and measured the string.)    </p>    <p>      To set up the hand-operated unit, we gathered the following      materials: a Sears, Roebuck & Co. "pitcher spout" hand      pump (Model No. 42K2749C . . . currently available for      $37.95), 25 feet of 1-1/4" plastic pipe, one plastic      screw-type adapter (for attaching the drop pipe to the      pump), and two 1-1/4" hose clamps (I used one to secure the      drop pipe onto the plastic adapter and the other to      temporarily affix the drop pipe to the well cap so that the      tubing wouldn't "accidentally" fall down into the well      casing while we were putting the system together). The      total bill for these components, <em>including</em> the      pump, came to just under $50. And when you consider that      our original well setup cost us a hefty $2,000, this manual      backup system was quite a bargain!    </p>    <p>      The only special tool I needed to install the apparatus was      a hole saw with a 1-1/4" bit, which I used to bore a circle      through the well cap. And though I opted to build a small      wooden pump house out of scrap lumber to mount the water      hauler on, you could simply attach the pump to a picnic      table or even directly onto the well cap itself.    </p>		    <p>      <strong>THE PROOF'S IN THE PUMPING</strong>    </p>    <p>      We've had our hand pump setup almost three years now, and      it's proved to be a huge success. We initially thought we      might resort to it only occasionally during an emergency,      but it actually gets used almost every day. Why, the      neighborhood children actually <em>wore out</em> our      original pump the very first summer we had it in operation!      (Even on the hottest days, the water it produced was clear      and ice-cold.)    </p>    <p>      We now have a more expensive "force" pump. This machine has      a pressure chamber and two faucets, allowing us to pump an      icy shower or - by connecting a garden hose to one of      the spigots - to water our flowers and vegetables.      But best of all, we no longer have to haul buckets to the      house during a power outage, as we did with the      earlier-model pump. By running a hose between the well and      a nearby outdoor faucet, we're able to refill our water      storage and heater tanks and/or pump water directly to any      tap in the house! And although we still don't actually      <em>welcome</em> those occasional periods of temporary      electrical power failure, when they do occur we no longer      anxiously await the dripping of the faucets.    </p>    <p>      Now if we could just remember to restock that box of      emergency candles, we'd be all set!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Models similar to the force pump      referred to by the author are available for $110 (Model No.      51-47) and $117 (Mode/No. 51-51), exclusive of shipping      charges, from Cumberland General Store, Dept.
