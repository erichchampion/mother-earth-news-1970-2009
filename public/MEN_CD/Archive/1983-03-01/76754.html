                    <p>      CHESAPEAKE BAY IS DETERIORATING: Both the Environmental      Protection Agency and the National Sportfishing Association      are declaring the Chesapeake Bay in trouble. An EPA report      describes widespread accumulations of potentially      suffocating (to aquatic life) phosphorus and nitrogen, and      extensive buildups of toxic metals and other hazardous      substances as well ... while the fisherfolk cite the      development of foreign markets by U.S. seafood dealers, and      the pressures of highly developed commercial ocean harvest      techniques, as factors behind the rapidly depleting fish      population in the bay.<br />      <br />      HEARD ANY GOOD OAKS LATELY? A few issues back, we reported      that trees are able to vary the chemical composition of      their leaves to defend themselves against insect attacks.      Well, further studies on that same subject have revealed      that some tree species can "communicate" with each other.      Scientists found that trees within 60 meters of infested      specimens also changed their leaves, even if they hadn't      yet been attacked. It's believed that a chemical acts as a      messenger of danger by traveling-through the air-from one      tree to another.<br />      <br />      HOSPITAL MEDICINE MAN: A hospital that serves Cherokee      Indians living in the mountains of western North Carolina      is combining advanced technology with native tradition.      Hospital administrator Dr. J.T. Garrett is also an      apprentice medicine man. And along with the latest in      diagnostic equipment, the facility has a "Traditional      Medicine Man Room" where groups meet to discuss such things      as herbs used in the community and the implementation of      traditional practices in the hospital routine.<br />      <br />      ADDITIVES IN ALCOHOL: According to the Center for Science      in the Public Interest, over one million people are      allergic to substances commonly added to beer, wine, and      liquor. Because the law does not require that ingredients      be printed on alcoholic-beverage labels, most consumers      don't know, for example, which wines contain such additives      as sulfur dioxide and which liqueurs contain coffee      whiteners. However, CSPI has a new book, Chemical Additives      in Booze, which lists the ingredients in many brand-name      beverages. It's available for $4.95 (postpaid) from CSPI,      Dept. NA-TMEN, 1755 S Street N.W., Washington, D.C.      20009.<br />      <br />      A RAIN BY ANY OTHER NAME: According to the chairman of the      Committee on Public Doublespeak (a group of teachers and      professors of English), last year the Environmental      Protection Agency required its employees to refrain from      using the term "acid rain" . . . and gave orders to replace      that "unpleasant" term with the less-inflammatory phrase      "poorly buffered precipitation".<br />      <br />      CRUELTY-FREE PRODUCTS: Beauty Without Cruelty, an      organization concerned with the inhumane use of animals for      product testing, now has a list of over 40 brands of      cosmetics and household cleansers that are considered      "cruelty free". The presidents, vice-presidents, managers,      or directors of safety for these brands have signed      statements that they neither test their products on animals      nor send them out for such tests. For more information      about cruelty-free items-and for a list of the companies      making them-send a self-addressed, stamped envelope (with      37  cents postage on it) to Beauty Without Cruelty, Dept.      TMEN, 175 West 12th Street, 16G, <strong>New York, New      York</strong> 10011.<br />      <br />      JUST PLANE POLITICS: Twenty A-10 attack aircraft, which the      Air Force did not want produced, were reinstated in the      defense budget by the Chairman of the House Appropriations      Subcommittee on Defense, Joseph P. Addabbo, last fall. And      just why did the Air Force not want the fliers? Well, the      planes are slow-moving jokes, according to the pilots (who      say that the most serious danger of operating the aircraft      is being hit in the back of the head by fast-moving birds).      So why did the Representative reinstate them? It seems that      the $357.3 million worth of A-10's are to be produced in      Farmingdale, New York, Mr. Addabbo's home district.<br />      <br />      TREE-HUGGERS HELP HIMALAYAS: It is estimated that little      more than 15% of the original tree cover is left on the      Himalayas ... and this disappearance of wood has led to      loss of topsoil, to floods, to droughts, and to landslides.      But there is hope that the situation may start to turn      around. A tiny crusade, which began in the early 1970's      when village women hugged trees to keep forestry workers      from cutting them, has now become a broadbased movement in      northern India ... and it's fostering increased awareness      of the problems of deforestation.<br />      <br />      SWING FOR YOUR SUPPER: Children seem to be one resource      that never suffers an energy crisis. In fact, many a parent      has wished for the ability to harness some of his or her      child's rambunctiousness. Well, now a company in Zimbabwe      has done just that. The firm has been issued a patent for a      device that uses children on swings to provide the power to      pump water from a well to a 30-foot-high storage tank.      While the mechanism doesn't affect the children's fun, it      certainly makes their play pay.<br />      <br />      PLASTIC SEAWEED, placed in the ocean around the Cape      Hatteras Lighthouse, seems to be doing a good job of      retaining sand and preventing erosion there.... A newly      organized MIDWIVES' ALLIANCE OF NORTH AMER ICA has members      from the U.S. and Canada, and is encouraging others to      join. For information on doing so, contact Carol Leonard,      Dept. TMEN, 30 South Main Street, Concord, New Hampshire      03301.... More than 1.3 MILLION FIREPLACES AND 2.1 MILLION      SOLID-FUEL-BURNING STOVES WERE INSTALLED IN U.S. HOMES IN      1981.... According to UNICEF, there's now evidence      suggesting that, IN POOR COUNTRIES, BABIES WHO ARE      BOTTLE-FED ARE THREE TO FIVE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO DIE IN      INFANCY THAN ARE BABIES WHO ARE BREAST-FED .... And      scientists are hoping that a newly founded SEMEN BANK FOR      WHOOPING CRANES will aid in keeping the endangered birds      from extinction. a<br />    </p>
