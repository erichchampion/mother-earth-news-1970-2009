            		        <p>      "WIND FARMS" ARE SPRINGING UP ALL OVER CALIFORNIA -and more      are planned in states from Montana to New Hampshire-as the      economics of wind-generated power become more and more      attractive to investors. Over 150 50-kilowatt-class      turbines have been producing power for three firms (which,      in turn, sell the current to Pacific Gas and Electric) in      California's Altamont Pass since early last year. Other      such "farms" are operating in the Golden State's Tehachapi      Mountains, and - if all goes according to the plans      of Southern California Edison and several involved      alternative-energy companies - by 1990 more than      2,000 wind generators will be erected in the San Gorgonio      Pass near Palm Springs, to churn out 1,000 megawatts of      current. (That's more than Hoover Dam's output!)<br />      <br />      MAYBE FAIRY GOBLETS WILL SOLVE OUR ENERGY PROBLEMS.      According to the USDA's Agriculture Research Service, fairy      goblets-a variety of bird's-nest fungus found      primarily on dead and rotting wood-display an      extraordinary ability to "eat" lignin, the gluelike      substance that holds plant cells together. Fairy goblets,      say the scientists, could be used to free the fermentable      sugars from leaves, stalks, and stems ... then yet another      biological helpmate, yeast, would convert the liberated      sugars to fuel-grade alcohol.<br />      <br />      THREE DIFFERENT "BREAKTHROUGH" TECHNIQUES for putting      sunlight to work to extract hydrogen from water-for      use as a fuel and for fertilizer and plastics      production-were announced within the span of a month      recently. But the proliferation of reported advances may be      as much a reflection of intense competition among      researchers as an indication of significant steps forward.      Hydrogen produced by solar water splitters isn't      costcompetitive with fossil fuels just yet ... but, says      one scientist, "the gap is narrowing".<br />      <br />      ARE KEROSENE HEATERS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR HEALTH? Although      they're not considered to be conclusive, several studies do      indicate that kerosene room heaters-both convective      and radiant types-produce levels of harmful      pollutants that exceed outdoor air quality standards set by      the Environmental Protection Agency. Because of the reports      and resulting citizen pressure, the Consumer Product Safety      Commission-which has twice rejected petitions asking      that the heaters be banned-is now conducting      extensive tests of its own ... and the results of the      investigation are scheduled to be released this      summer.<br />      <br />      THE CARCINOGENIC FORM OF BENZO[A]PYRENE, A COMMON POLLUTANT      produced by woodstoves, autos, and industry smokestacks,      may-say some researchers-be "neutralized" by      ellagic acid, a substance found in a variety of plants and      plant products, including grapes, coffee, and nuts.      Although this phenomenon has thus far been confirmed only      in laboratory tests, the studies are so promising that some      observers predict the day will come when "anti-cancer      crops"-plants high in ellagic acid-will be      cultivated on a large scale. (Meanwhile, pass the grape      juice, please .... )<br />      <br />      IN 1984, THE SPACE SHUTTLE WILL CARRY A TEN-STORY-TALL      SOLAR ARRAY WING that-remarkably-will be only      four inches thick when folded in the craft's cargo bay ...      but, when extended, will measure 105 feet long and 15-1/2      feet wide. The structure-which consists of printed-circuit      solar cells "welded" to a super-lightweight plastic      film-will produce 12.5 kilowatts and is considered a      first step toward the still ecologically questionable      large-scale generation of electricity from sunlight in      outer space.<br />      <br />      THE FIRST DECLINE IN SUMMER ELECTRICAL USE SINCE WORLD WAR      II occurred last year, reports the Edison Electric      Institute. The organization says that peak electrical      demand during 1982's warm season fell 2.7% below the      previous summer's ... a development that-in the face      of the North American Electric Reliability Council's      earlier prediction of a 2.3% increase for the same      period-left the nation's utilities with the biggest      surplus generating capacity since the Depression.      Meanwhile, the industry continues to build new plants (and      to pass the costs on to consumers) ... all the while      justifying the construction by saying that it's necessary      to meet projected demand.<br />      <br />      IF YOU COMMUTE 30 MILES OR MORE ROUND TRIP TO WORK, you may      be able to eliminate your costs for that travel-and      turn a tidy profit besides-by running a van pool,      says the Alliance to Save Energy. The idea isn't for      everyone (some states prohibit such businesses, for      example), but the organization claims that people who do      qualify can expect to net a 24% after-tax profit from the      enterprise. To find out more, write and request the      Alliance's free brochure on van pooling ... then, if that      information encourages you, you may want to order (for      $2.50 postpaid) the workbook Vanpooling for Profit: A      Business Opportunity , which details applicable state      regulations and provides instructions for estimating the      profitability of such an undertaking. The address: Alliance      to Save Energy, Dept. TMEN, 1925 K Street N.W., Washington,      D.C. 20006.<br />      <br />      With over four acres of glass, the planned      500,000-square-foot St. Enoch Square Mall in Glasgow,      Scotland will be ONE OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST PASSIVE SOLAR      GLASS-ENCLOSED STRUCTURES .... City officials in Duarte,      California are powering a 2, 100-kilowatt, piston-driven      generator with GAS FROM A LOCAL LANDFILL'S DECOMPOSING      GARBAGE .... Scientists say MOREECONOMICAL SOLAR COLLECTOR      SURFACES MAY BE DEVELOPED USING 2,000-YEAR-OLD TECHNIQUES      employed by the Chinese to coat swords and art objects with      a dark, protective patina.... A "SOVIET SUN CITY" POWERED      WITH WIND AND SOLAR ENERGY is being built, by the U.S.S.R.,      in Central Asia, and will house more than 300      scientists.... The aviation industry is beginning to      produce A NEW GENERATION OF FUEL-EFFICIENT AIRCRAFT,      including Boeing's recently introduced 757's and      767's-which can provide fuel savings of up to 35%      over the old 727-and, by the 1990's, a new prop-fan      engine now being developed by Hamilton Standard is expected      to cut consumption (with no loss in air speed) by an      additional 20-30%.<br />    </p>
