                <p>      <em>Try an alternative to overpriced store-bought Easter      candies.</em>    </p>             <h5 id="byline">    by Sue Santore    </h5>    <p>      Thanks to the relentless commercialization of our holidays,      it's <em>impossible</em> to visit most supermarkets or      department stores at this time of year without passing      shelves that seem to groan under pyramids of seductively      wrapped Easter confections. And of course, when parents      must shepherd their <em>children</em> past those displays,      the youngsters are likely to respond (as the manufacturers      planned) by begging for some of the candy.    </p>    <p>      Well, I've been faced with that problem in the past, but      now <em>-</em> rather than being forced to decide      whether to give in (rationalizing by saying, "Oh well, it      is a holiday") or hold firm in my determination not to feed      my brood such overpriced and overprocessed foods      <em>-</em> I just tell the kids that there'll be      treats enough in their baskets ... and homemade ones at      that! Perhaps you'll find some things in my family's Easter      "menu" to please the children in your life!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COCONUT "CREAM" EGGS</strong> <em><br /></em> 1      coconut<br />      1 medium potato<br />      1/4 teaspoon of salt<br />      1teaspoon of vanilla<br />      3 pounds (or less) of confectioner's sugar<br />      1 pound of semisweet chocolate    </p>    <p>      This recipe is really quite "sweet-intensive". However, our      children eat only a thin slice of the large treats at a      time ... and the eggs last days that way. To create them,      first prepare the fresh coconut.    </p>    <p>      Begin by piercing the two "eyes" on top of the shell and      pouring the juice into a glass (it's good to drink fresh or      to use in place of water when making cakes and such). Then      bake the nut, for 15 minutes, in a 400°F oven. (I use a      woodstove, so I'm estimating a bit here.) Once it's cooled,      place the coconut on a chopping board and give it a sharp      rap with a hammer. The hard outer shell should pretty much      fall away. You can then pry off any stubborn pieces of meat      with a paring knife, and scrape the thin brown skin from      the white inner flesh before shredding your fresh coconut.    </p>    <p>      Next, peel the potato and boil it in salted water for 10      minutes. When the time's up, carefully fish the hot spud      from the water and mash it. Then mix the grated coconut,      the still-warm mashed potato, the salt, and the vanilla in      a large bowl.    </p>    <p>      Now, you can begin to add the sugar <em>-</em>      gradually <em>-</em> and mix it, after each addition,      until the ingredients are well blended. The egg-to-be      should then be allowed to "ripen" overnight. The following      morning, divide the mixture into three equal portions (or      more, if you'd like to produce smaller eggs). Shape the      dough with your hands, and <em>-</em> when that's      done <em>-</em> store the eggs in a safe place (away      from pets, insects, or children's fingers), letting them      "age" for two to seven days. (This "rest period" really      does improve the flavor of the filling.)    </p>    <p>      When you're ready to finish the eggs, melt the chocolate      over hot water in a double boiler (make sure that no drops      of water fall into the candy). Then, using a slotted spoon,      dip the eggs into the melted coating one at a time, and      place them on a wire rack to harden. Finally, while the      chocolate is still warm, use a toothpick to write each      child's name on top of his or her egg.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEANUT BUTTER NUT EGGS</strong><br />      1-1/2 cups of peanut butter<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      2 teaspoons of vanilla<br />      1-1/2 cups of powdered milk<br />      2 cups of oatmeal<br />      1 cup of chopped nuts or sunflower seeds<br />      4 tablespoons of boiling water<br />      shredded coconut or chopped nuts    </p>    <p>      In a large bowl, mix the peanut butter, honey, and vanilla.      Then gradually work in the powdered milk and the oatmeal      ... kneading the mixture vigorously to blend everything      well. Now, put in the nuts and knead again. Once the dough      is mixed and very stiff, add the boiling water ... a      tablespoon at a time. When the dough is easy to handle and      damp enough to hold a crunchy coating, pinch off lumps ...      shape them into eggs ... and roll them in shredded coconut      or chopped nuts.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>CAROB EGGS</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      1 cup of carob powder<br />      1 cup of honey<br />      1 cup of peanut butter<br />      1 cup of powdered milk<br />      1 cup of chopped peanuts<br />      1/2 cup of toasted wheat germ<br />      coconut or chopped nuts (optional)    </p>    <p>      Sift the carob into a large bowl, then add the rest of the      ingredients ... working them with your hands until they're      well blended. If the mixture is too dry, add a few drops of      water. On the other hand, should it be too wet, you can      work in more powdered milk ... a tablespoon at a time. Once      you've achieved the right consistency, shape the dough into      eggs and <em>-</em> again <em>-</em> coat them      with shredded coconut or chopped nuts if you like.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>HONEY CUTOUT COOKIES</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      1/3 cup of butter<br />      1/3 cup of sugar<br />      2/3 cup of honey<br />      1 egg<br />      1 teaspoon of vanilla<br />      2-1/2 cups of unbleached flour<br />      1/4 cup of whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1 teaspoon of salt<br />      1 teaspoon of baking soda    </p>    <p>      Begin to make these treats by creaming the butter and sugar      in a sizable bowl ... then add the honey, egg, and vanilla,      beating the batter well with each addition. When that's      done, you can sift both kinds of flour, with the salt and      soda, into a separate container. Now, add the combined dry      ingredients <em>-</em> one-third at a time      <em>-</em> to the contents of the large bowl,      blending the mixture with enthusiasm.    </p>    <p>      The finished dough should be chilled <em>-</em> at      least an hour, or (better yet) overnight <em>-</em>      before it's rolled to 1/4" thick and cut with commercial      cookie cutters or the tip of a sharp knife. Place your      rabbits, ducks, or what have you on a greased cookie sheet      ... decorate them, if you like, by pressing raisins into      the dough ... and bake them in a 350°F oven. Allow 8 to      10 minutes for small cookies, and 10 to 15 minutes for      large "gingerbread" characters.    </p>    <p>      By using these recipes, you can have a veritable cornucopia      of goodies to delight your youngsters come April 3. And if      your children seem a bit confused that the Easter Bunny      fills his baskets with Mom's or Dad's cooking, just tell      them that ol' Peter Cottontail helped out in the kitchen!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE.
