                <p>      <em>MOM's gardening expert tests the new introductions and      tells us what we'll reap when we<br /> sow.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Brent Elswick    </h5>    <p>      Never, in close to 20 years of gardening, has my plot      produced as abundantly as it did last summer. And that      achievement came as a bit of a surprise to me, because the      weather in our mountain valley in eastern Kentucky was      either extremely hot or downright cold, and ranged from      very wet to very dry. In short, 1982 didn't offer what I'd      consider <em>ideal</em> gardening conditions!    </p>    <p>      I'm inclined, therefore, to attribute my success to the      fact that I had more outstanding new varieties to include      in last year's trials than I've ever had before. And those      cultivars produced so well (despite the "off" summer) that      my family had all the fresh vegetables we could eat, can,      and freeze ... <em>and</em> plenty left over to give away.    </p>    <p>      Here's a rundown on the backyard producers that promise to      be tops in <em>your</em> garden for '83.    </p>    <h3>PRINCELY PEAS</h3>    <p>      Although I usually plant my early crops in February, I was      forced <em>-</em> by extreme cold <em>-</em> to      wait until mid-March to put out the coolweather lovers,      such as peas. Despite that late start, however, my garden      produced an abundant harvest of the early bloomers.    </p>    <p>      Folks who are familiar with succulent Sugar Snap peas will      be glad to know that there are now three <em>dwarf</em>      varieties ... and the new cultivars require no staking!      Check with Henry Field (and others) for the earliest and      most compact of the trio, Sugar Bon. This plant's vines      reach only 18" to 24" high, but are extremely productive.      The second ,"midget" to mature, Sugar Mel, sports prolific      24" to 28" vines. And Sugar Rae, the latest bloomer of the      bunch, matures at much the same time as does the original      Sugar Snap, but its loaded vines are only about half as      tall. (You can purchase either of the latter two varieties      from Gurney Seed & Nursery.)    </p>    <p>      Thompson & Morgan is also offering a snap pea similar      to the dwarf strains just mentioned. The firm's Edula      matures a few days before Sugar Snap and yields a profusion      of crisp, sweet peas on 26" determinate vines. And Sweet      Snap, a new semidwarf cultivar . that's available from      several sources, not only has all the attributes of the      <em>other</em> introductions, but also displays remarkable      resistance to powdery mildew, legume yellows, and virus ...      three of the most devastating pea diseases. Dwarf White      Sugar, a new offering from Vermont Bean Seed Company, is      anoth er definite winner in the snow and sugar pea      category. It's the most productive variety of this type      that I've ever grown ... and has excellent resistance to      fusarium wilt.    </p>    <p>      Those of you living in the northern regions will want to      try out Gurney's Pacemaker ... a sweet, high-quality Alaska      variety. This new 'wilt-resistant pea produces a huge      canning crop ... and is said to thrive despite cold, damp      weather. (In fact, no matter <em>where you</em> live, you'd      do well to sow an extra-early crop of this fine new      cultivar.)    </p>    <p>      One of the very best peas for freezing is Multistar, from T      & M. While it matures pretty late (in 75 days), its 30"      vines produce an incredible harvest of super-sweet peas.      Don't overlook this one!    </p>    <p>      If you read my reviews of <em>last</em> year's new      varieties (MOTHER NO. 74, page 54), you might remember my      mentioning the Novella pea, a "leafless" sort. Well, this      year's offerings include two new cultivars of that type:      Bikini (T & M) and Lacy Lady (Henry Field, and Vermont      Bean Seed Company). The 34" plants concentrate more on pod      development than on leaf making, and the intertwining      tendrils characteristic of this strain support one another      and keep the abundant crop well off the ground. Both      require 65 days to produce a harvest of quality,      all-purpose peas.    </p>    <p>      Finally, for those of you who enjoy southern field peas,      there are a couple of dandies to consider. I especially      like Dixielee, an edible-podded offering (from      Wyatt-Quarles Seed Company) that's extremely resistant to      nematode attack. Another good choice is Zipper Cream (H.G.      Hastings & Company). As its name implies, the cultivar      has a "zipper" string that makes shelling a cinch. The      compact, bushy plants produce tasty, creamy white peas that      are table-ready in 75 days.    </p>    <h3>SALAD SELECTIONS</h3>    <p>      Soon after the peas go into the ground, I'm ready to sow my      first lettuce bed. Last spring, the best of the bunch was      Burpee Seed Company's Red Salad Bowl. Since I've always      considered Salad Bowl to be the top-of-the-line leaf      lettuce, I was delighted to see that this firm had come up      with a scarlet-hued variation. Burpee also offers Royal Oak      Leaf, a great improvement over the older Oak Leaf. This      cultivar is well suited to hot-weather growing, and its      leaves are thick, tasty, tender, and ready to eat in 50      days. And be sure to leave some space for Sweetie, which is      one honey of a leaf lettuce! This offering from Gurney and      Henry Field tastes something like the famed Butterhead      variety, and if its leaves are kept harvested, it'll      produce right on into the summer.    </p>    <p>      Other lettuces deserving honorable mention are T & M's      Erthel (also called Crisp Mint), a sweet, crisp-textured      Romaine that's extremely heat-resistant ... and Salinas      (from T & T Seeds, Ltd., the fine Canadian firm), which      is one of the very best crisphead lettuce varieties yet      developed (it's even resistant to tipburn, a problem with      most other head types).    </p>    <p>      I plant my radishes right in the lettuce bed ... and this      year's trials unearthed some stellar garden additions.      Cherry Beauty (T & M and Twilley) is one of the few      hybrids, and its sweet, tender, bright red roots will      mature before you know it if you don't keep a keen eye out!      If you prefer <em>white</em> radishes, try Pa      <em>-</em> a Japanese-European cross that has long      (6- to 8") Icicle-type roots that're crunchy, tender, and      spicy <em>-</em> from George W. Park Seed Company.      Vermont Bean's Tama is a hybrid that's similar to Pax in      appearance, but it's a cold-weather cultivar that's best      planted in late summer. The 18" <em>-</em> long white      roots are smooth, tender, and crisp ... and they'll keep      well into the winter.    </p>    <p>      When I plant my lettuces and radishes, I also sow a bed of      greens. One of the most spectacular offerings this year is      Green-in-the-Snow from T & M. A centuries-old culinary      delight that was recently "rediscovered" in China, this      crop will withstand <em>extremely cool</em> conditions and      still produce tender, spicy, mustard-flavored leaves. It's      definitely worth a trial ... especially in regions where      the climate tends to be cold and damp.    </p>    <p>      Northrup-King (through Liberty Seeds) is making available a      superior new hybrid mustard <em>-</em> Savannah      <em>-</em> that's prized for its fast growth and      fresh green foliage. Not a curled type, this cultivar      resembles the Tendergreen varieties, and is highly tolerant      of cold <em>and</em> heat.    </p>    <p>      If a prize were to be given for the quickest-to-mature      green, it'd have to go to Dwarf Essex rape, from Porter      & Son, Seedsmen. This mild potherb matures in only      three weeks, and will <em>keep on</em> producing if it's      kept harvested.    </p>    <p>      Spinach lovers can choose from two new varieties this year.      Vermont Bean has Benton Number 2 Hybrid, a Japanese      cultivar that's disease-resistant, quite tasty, and      somewhat heat-tolerant. And the other excellent offering is      T & M's Monnopa. This "Popeye green" is unique among      spinach strains in that it is low in oxalic acid. (For this      reason, Monnapa is often used in baby food.) And since      oxalic acid is thought to be responsible for the bitterness      sometimes noted in this green, T & M's contender is      especially sweet and delicately flavored.    </p>    <p>      Park's Swiss Chard of Geneva is as distinguished a variety      as its lengthy name seems to imply. The thick      <em>stalks</em> of this tasty green can be served up like      asparagus, and the cold <em>-</em> hardy plant will thrive      year round in moderate climes.    </p>    <p>      Still other greens worth noting are Park's Hicrop collard      (the flavor of the 15" hybrid is both mild and sweet) ...      Spurt, a variety of kale from Thompson & Morgan (it's      so good it can be eaten raw!) ... and Twilley's All Top      turnip green (this one's small root is inedible, but the      abundant green tops are delicious).    </p>    <h3>THE UNDERGROUND HARVEST</h3>    <p>      A couple of weeks before the last expected frost date, I      like to plant carrots and beets. The most productive beet      in my 1982 trials was Red Baron from Ferry-Morse. Its      uniform round shape and lovely color make it especially      attractive for canning. Best of All (J.W. Jung) isn't      really a <em>new</em> variety, but the delicious, deep red      roots of this "baby" canning beet don't get nearly the      attention they deserve. Yet another noteworthy variety is      Sangria ... a juicy red, early-to-mature, and slow-to-bolt      offering from Petoseed. Thompson & Morgan's Albina      Vereduna, a new white beet, also performed well last      summer. Its sweet, rich flesh was even better in quality      than that of the "reds", and the curly tops made delicious      greens.    </p>    <p>      Among carrots, the variety Planet (Stokes) was by far the      most <em>unusual</em> in my trials. Its 1-1/2' -diameter,      globe-shaped roots are excellent for wholepack canning. And      <em>-</em> going to the other end of the spectrum      <em>-</em> T & M's Zino was the <em>largest</em>      carrot I've ever grown that still had good eating quality:      The 10"long Brobdingnagian weighs in at around 3 to 4      pounds, and <em>-</em> in humus-rich soil      <em>-</em> it's not uncommon to get <em>10-pound</em>      specimens! Give it a try if you're looking for a good      juicer.    </p>    <p>      One of the very best Imperator types to come along is      Cutlass, from Liberty Seeds. The 10"-long, slender carrot      is uniform in size, lovely in color, sweet-tasting, and      tender ... but, like all in this class, it <em>must</em>      have loose, sandy soil if it's to do well.    </p>    <p>      For years most gardeners have agreed that the best-quality      carrots are those of the Nantes type ... and Vermont Bean      Seed Company's Bonanza Hybrid is one of the most nearly      perfect Nantes ever developed. The reddish orange 8" roots      have an extra-sweet flavor that's ideal for all uses.    </p>    <p>      Turnips are another crop that I like to get in the ground      before the soil warms up. Last year, Twilley's Royal Globe      II (a greatly improved Purple Top White Globe type) matured      into the most attractive turnip I've ever grown. For      quality, though, none equals Liberty's White Knight Hybrid.      While this prizewinner takes two weeks longer than most      varieties to become table-ready, it is by far the tastiest,      and remains free of any bitter flavor longer than most. If      you're interested in an early maturer, try the sweet, mild,      white roots of Herbst's White Express (the greens of this      one are delicious, too).    </p>    <p>      Only one new potato variety did well for me last year:      Crystal (from Gurney). Grown from sets, it produced large      yields of oblong white tubers with clear skin ... and the      vigorous plants resist late blight <em>and</em> scab.    </p>    <p>      I've always found growing onions from seed to be one of the      most rewarding of all gardening endeavors, and nurturing      1982's crop was no exception. Check with the folks at      Gurney and Henry Field for Owa, an especially pretty yellow      onion that's sweet and mild. However, as with all torpedo      varieties, this one doesn't keep well. On the other hand,      Zodiak <em>-</em> a Spanish onion from T & T      <em>-</em> is a surprisingly good keeper, and the      brown-skinned, medium-sized bulbs are firm and sweet. For      even better keeping quality, though, try Autumn Glo ... an      Olds introduction. This cultivar's attractive globes mature      early, too, making them ideal for marketing purposes.    </p>    <h3>ROLL CALL FOR COLE CROPS</h3>    <p>      I try to be honest in these reviews of the new varieties,      and for the second year in a row, I must admit that few      cole crops performed up to my expectations. Part of the      problem could be that I waited a little longer than usual      before setting out the plants ... and hot, dry weather set      in soon thereafter. A few seeds, however, did well enough      to be worthy of mention.    </p>    <p>      The best of the lot was Prime Time cabbage, a new      Ferry-Morse variety offered by Midwest Seed Growers. The      plant's 4-pound, silvery blue green heads mature in      midseason (72 days) and have exceptionally good interior      quality. This one is a sure winner for your 1983 garden.      Hancock Hybrid from Jung was another midseason arrival. It      exhibited excellent diseaseresistance, and the heads were      equally tasty for slaw in stews, or as sauerkraut. Erdeno      (by Sluis & Groot) proved to be as fine a producer of      3to 4-pound heads as it was in my 1981 trials, growing      better than most cabbages do in the heat of summer. Two      final entries, Green Parade from Burpee (it has a lovely      green hue) and Tuffy No. 15 from Herbst (fine quality with      multiple disease-resistance), did quite well ... and I      intend to try them again <em>this</em> summer.    </p>    <p>      First prize in the cauliflower category went to Thompson      & Morgan's Dok Elgon. This highly recommended      variety-with its self wrapping leaves and tasty heads      <em>-</em> is about as close to a perfect plant as      possible, having stood up to trials worldwide. And a      noteworthy hot-weather, self-wrapping type for      <em>summer</em> planting is Stovepipe, offered by both      Johnny's Selected Seeds and Gurney.    </p>    <p>      Also from Johnny's is Cape Queen, a sturdy broccoli hybrid      that produces a high yield of tender, blue green shoots.      And you'll want to try Burpee's Bonanza Hybrid, noted for      the large number of side heads it produces <em>after</em>      the initial harvest.    </p>    <p>      Titurel, a hybrid from Sluis & Groot, was the      <em>only</em> variety of brussels sprouts that performed      well in my '82 trials. The medium <em>-</em> tall plants      matured quite early ... however, <em>I did</em> have to      fight off the harlequin bugs to get to the succulent,      well-shaped little heads. This one's a dandy for folks who      savor the delicate taste of these "mini-cabbages".    </p>    <h3>TOP-OF-THE-LINE TOMATOES</h3>    <p>      It's well known that tomatoes are the most popular      home-garden crop, and <em>-</em> with all the      wonderful varieties to choose from <em>-</em> I can      easily understand why. I can't possibly list <em>all</em>      the new arrivals that did well for me last summer, but      there were a few that stood out, even among that impressive      crowd.    </p>        <p>      First of all, I'd be hard-put to find a better      <em>early</em> tomato than Goldsmith's Quick Pick. This      sure winner (which is also offered by Park) is <em>the</em>      most disease-resistant <em>-</em> it's protected      against verticillium and fusarium wilt, nematodes, and      tobacco mosaic virus <em>-</em> of the early-maturing      varieties (it needs only 50 days to be table-ready). And      the medium-sized fruits <em>-</em> produced on      indeterminate vines <em>-</em> are meaty, firm, and      tasty. Sprinter (Twilley) is another stellar early hybrid      that bears small but sweet fruit all summer (and right up      to the first frost). Stokes Pak VFN (from Stokes, of      course) also did well for me, bearing large, firm fruits      that would be ideal for shipping or marketing. And if      you're a canner, you'll want to try Porter's Pride (from      the company of that name). The small (3-ounce), vivid red      globes on this plant are perfect for canning whole.    </p>    <p>      Big Pick (offered by both Goldsmith and Park) won the      honors among the <em>midseason</em> varieties. Carrying the      same disease resistance as its smaller companion, Quick      Pick, Big Pick will give you about as large and tasty a      tomato (averaging 11 ounces) as you can eat. And if you're      looking for a prolific picker that's good for both canning      <em>and</em> marketing, you won't beat Caracas Hybrid VFN,      an offering from Sluis & Groot.    </p>    <p>      The busy folks at Petoseed have come up with two new      midseason tomatoes this year, Baron and President. Of the      pair, Baron matures sooner and President has larger fruit.      And-not one to be left out of the action-As-grow has made      available three new garden varieties: Tempo (it's the      earliest of the three, and it has large fruit on compact      vines) ... Sunny (it produced medium-sized globes on a      taller plant) ... and Vista (this was the last to ripen,      but the tall plants were <em>loaded</em> with bright red      fruit). Each member of the trio is quite resistant to      disease and highly recommended.    </p>    <p>      I discovered two excellent <em>canning</em> varieties in my      trials last summer: Royal Chico (from Herbst and others)      yielded an unbelievably large harvest of small pear-type      scarlet tomatoes ... and Peto 13, a larger "pear" from      Petoseed, was loaded with tasty canners all summer. For      folks with limited space, Goldsmith's Patio Prize was the      best of the small compact varieties. This new offering is a      definite improvement over the older Patio tomato, with      larger fruit on more productive plants.    </p>    <h3>PICK A PECK OF PEPPERS</h3>    <p>      There was no question as to which pepper took the prize      last summer: Skipper (from Asgrow) stood head and shoulders      above the others. The big four-lobed peppers are thick and      tasty, and not only do they mature fairly early, but they      also produce right up to the first frost. (Close contenders      were Pro-Bell from Twilley and Big Belle from FerryMorse.)    </p>    <p>      When it comes to looks, though, I'd have to say that the      <em>prettiest</em> pepper in my trials was the recent      All-America Award winner, Gypsy (offered by many seed      houses). This variety's 3" to 4" tapered fruits turned a      lovely yellow when mature, and were extremely sweet. Sluis      & Groot's Golden Asti is another beauty, bearing more      typical bell-shaped peppers for some superb eating. Other      promising sweet varieties are Naples <em>-</em> a      long, highquality, frying type from Stokes <em>-</em>      and Blue Star from Asgrow.    </p>    <p>      One of the more interesting hot pepper newcomers is      Burpee's Zippy Hybrid. This mild cayenne type is great for      flavoring soups, salads, and sauces. For a spicier bite,      try T & M's Antler, a superior hot hybrid, or Taco from      Herbst. (This one's 3" fruits will all but set you      <em>on</em> fire!) Finally, the <em>largest</em> hot pepper      to produce well was Numex Big Jim (Burrell and Gurney), a      good choice for drying.    </p>    <p>      Before leaving the pepper plot, let me mention a companion      ... the eggplant. Only two varieties did well for me last      summer: Beauty Hybrid (by Petoseed, and available through      Park) and Giniac (from Sluis & Groot). Both are early      producers of quality fruit, with the main difference being      the shape of the vegetables (Beauty is nearly round,      whereas Giniac is quite elongated).    </p>    <h3>FAVORITES FROM THE CORNFIELD</h3>        <p>      Being something of a gambler by nature, I like to plant a      patch or two of corn a couple of weeks earlier than normal,      in hopes that the weather will warm up in time. Luckily,      last year's hot weather came in soon after I'd sown those      seeds, and the two varieties I'd chosen performed superbly.      One of these "experiments" was by far the most delicious      cultivar to grace my garden in '82: Pride And Joy sweet      corn, a bicolor available from both Olds and Liberty. I      simply can't say enough about this one! The 8-1/2"-long      ears mature a little behind the earlier varieties (taking      72 to 75 days), but the 14 rows of kernels you'll then sink      your teeth into are well worth waiting for. Even the leaves      of this sturdy plant <em>-</em> which have an      attractive purple hue in their midribs and borders      <em>-</em> are exceptional. This is <em>the</em> best      bicolor variety I've seen yet, and it promises to become      one of the most popular and widely grown among all sorts of      sweet corn.    </p>    <p>      Another bicolor, one that I think deserves trial again in      '83, is Symphony from Harris. The combination of standard      and super-sweet characteristics makes this cultivar a      delicious treat. (You'd do best to plant it in warmed soil,      though.)    </p>    <p>      Early Star, from Midwest Seeds, was <em>-</em> as you      may remember <em>-</em> a contender in the 1981      trials, and it did well again last year as the "other"      early-planted corn. This quick crop per is a good, vigorous      variety for spring planting in cold, damp climates.    </p>    <p>      Two fine new <em>white</em> corn varieties are being      offered this year. Snow Queen EH from Henry Field and      Gurney, the first white EH (the initials stand for      "everlasting heritage" and mean that the corn will retain      its sweetness for up to two weeks after maturity), is best      compared to the popular Kandy Korn, a delicious super-sweet      hybrid. The large plump ears on this strong plant have an      unforgettable flavor <em>...</em> it's definitely a rising      star! The other outstanding new white corn was Silver      Prince from Harris. This contender to the famous Silver      Queen's crown has a few features not offered by the      well-known matriarch <em>...</em> including an earlier      maturity date, a sturdier plant, and the ability to sprout      in cold, damp soil.    </p>    <p>      If you hanker for <em>yellow</em> sweet corn, you'll want      to try Tendertreat EH, an exceptionally sweet "keeper"      available from Twilley and Henry Field. Pennfresh ADX (a      fine supersweet from Agway) is yet another yellow dandy,      and one that stood up well during its <em>sec</em> ond year      of trial in 1982.    </p>    <p>      This spring's offerings include quite a few excellent      conventional yellow varieties, too: Medallion (an 80-day      cultivar from Rogers) <em>...</em> Mellow Yellow (an      improved jubilee from Ferry-Morse) <em>...</em> Mevak (a      disease-resistant winner from Asgrow) <em>...</em> and      Marada (another Asgrow introduction). Rogers' 2327 and      Target A from Ferry-Morse were two other yellow hybrids      that grew well and deserve further trial.    </p>    <h3>SUPERIOR SQUASH</h3>        <p>      Our family has never been blessed with such an abundance of      squash-summer <em>and</em> winter types-as it      was in 1982. At least a dozen fine zucchini varieties      performed well. Asgrow's Dusk was one of the best, with      slim, dark green fruits. A similar variety is a FerryMorse      offering, Onyx, which is also listed by T & M. The      blackish fruits of this productive plant are quite long and      slender. One of the more interesting new zucchinis is      Servane from Sluis & Groot. Its medium-green speckled      fruits are cylindrical-but not as long or slim as the      other two I've mentioned-and are excellent for use in      breads and cakes.    </p>    <p>      Two summer squash that I found to be well worth growing are      both from Petoseed: Gold Crest, an excellent yellow      straightneck <em>...</em> and Peter Pan, a light green      frying type that became our family's favorite.    </p>        <p>      A pair of new winter squash varieties warrant mention this      year: Butterbush, a compact butternut, and Early Acorn      (both from Burpee). And one <em>older</em> type performed      so well that I must call your attention to it. You might      remember Waltham Butternut, an All-America Award winner      from several years ago that's available from many seed      suppliers. Well (though I hate to admit it), I never did      get around to growing that squash until last summer      <em>...</em> and now I'm convinced that if <em>ever</em> a      variety deserved an award, this fantastic butternut did!      I've never seen a winter squash <em>of any</em> type      produce so well (on one plant alone, I counted more than 25      perfect fruits!) or have such superior quality. If you      haven't given this one a try, I urge you to do so this      year.    </p>    <h3>      CONFIDENT CUCUMBERS</h3>        <p>      About the same time that our summer squash is planted      (around May 1), I like to get the cucumbers going. And the      honors this time go to Sweet Success, the All-America Award      winner by Petoseed. This cross between the fine Sweet Slice      and the older burpless types produces 8" to 9" fruits of      unsurpassed quality. You can be sure that this one's a      future star of the cuke world and will be listed by      <em>many</em> leading companies! Two other tasty burpless      varieties are Euro-American, offered by Goldsmith and Park,      and Coolgreen from Asgrow.    </p>    <p>      Pacer, a disease-resistant hybrid from Harris, was the best      <em>slicing</em> cuke in my garden last summer <em>...</em>      and Flurry, an Asgrow introduction with atractive 4"      fruits, was tops among the picklers, with Sluis &      Groot's Salvo-a fine producer-coming in a close      second.    </p>    <p>      There's recently been a great deal of interest in compact      cuke varieties, and last summer I grew two such "midgets".      Spacermaster is all that Burpee claims it to be      <em>...</em> and possibly a bit more. The dwarf plants are      mosaic-resistant and produce 7" to 8" fruits in abundance.      Goldsmith's Bush Crop, now also offered by Burrell, is of      similar quality.    </p>    <h3>THE BEST BEANS</h3>        <p>      Last summer's spurts of cold weather didn't make for an      award-winning bean crop, but a <em>few</em> cultivars came      through the season with flying colors, despite their      somewhat chilly start. Asgrow has brought out three      exceptional bush varieties, all of which mature in about 50      days. Flo, the first of these, shows excellent disease      resistance, and its tasty 5-1/2" pods should market well.      Win is a processing bean that rivals Early Gallatin, the      leader in that class. The other fine Asgrow variety (also      offered by Hastings) is Eagle, a bean that should be      especially popular with southern growers for canning and      freezing. And when it comes to quality and taste, Rogers'      Coloma is <em>tops</em> on our family's list.    </p>    <p>      A truly <em>unusual</em> bean for 1983 is Cheverbel by T      & M. This triple-purpose 55-day cultivar is delicious      when used as a snap bean, or fixed like limas, or dried for      use in soups! Look for Gourmet from Twilley to be a real      leader of the bean pack, though. This disease-resistant      legume is an exceptional producer of delicious beans for      whole-pod canning or French-style slicing.    </p>    <p>      Other highly recommended beans for your '83 garden are      sweet-flavored Garrafel Oro (T & M), a prolific pole      variety, and Seafarer (Porter and Johnny's), a hardy navy      bean.    </p>    <h3>A MULTITUDE OF MELONS</h3>    <p>      It seemed as if every seed company came out with new melon      varieties last year <em>...</em> and I can recommend some      banner selections for 1983. Asgrow offers a trio of fine      hybrid cantaloupes: Harmony, the first of its introductions      to mature, yields large 4-pound fruits in only three      months, and it's followed by Don Juan, a lovely      football-shaped melon with tremendous taste. Chando, though      the last of the new dandies to mature, is a superb      Charantais type with small, sweet fruit of excellent      quality.    </p>    <p>      If your garden spot is small, you'll be glad to know that      there are several compact cantaloupes to choose from this      season. The best of these is probably Burpee's Sweet 'n      Early Hybrid, which produces six to eight tasty 2-pound      'loupes per plant <em>...</em> in about 75 days. Two      similar varieties are Scoop Hybrid (Park) and Musketeer (a      hybrid from Park and Goldsmith).    </p>    <p>      Those who favor the honeydews should give Honeydrip (by      Herbst and Park) a try. This earlymaturing melon is as      sweet as nectar! And while Golden Beauty casaba by    </p>    <p>      Herbst and Burrell isn't actually a <em>new</em> offering,      its large, sugary fruits deserve attention from gardeners      in areas with long growing seasons.    </p>    <p>      To round out this list, here are two <em>white-fleshed</em>      melon varieties that performed well last year: Israeli by      Porter (a disease-resistant cultivar with large, aromatic      fruits) and T & M's Gaylia (this one matures before      Israeli and is suited to cooler climes).    </p>    <p>      My watermelons grew well in '82, too, and there are several      new varieties to choose from this year. Petoseed offers two      of the best, Royal Jubilee and Prince Charles. Like its      parent, Jubilee, Royal Jubilee is a steady producer of      large oblong fruits, and the hybrid plants are vigorous and      disease-resistant. Prince Charles is a smaller, more      prolific hybrid of the famed Charleston Grey, and its      bright red flesh is lip-smacking good! Look for both      introductions in many of the '83 catalogs.    </p>    <p>      Asgrow offers two fine watermelons as well. Madera is an      early-maturing medium-sized melon with excellent quality      and disease resistance, while the bright red, sugary flesh      of Perola is a sure bet for roadside markets. If you're      hankering for a <em>compact</em> melon, Petoseed's Sweet      Baby is one of the most prolific midgets yet developed.      Some other "minis" to look for this spring are Baby Fun      (Petoseed), Sugar Bush (Burpee), and Bush Baby (Park).    </p>    <h3>A COVEY OF CULTIVARS</h3>    <p>      Finally-if you can find just a <em>little</em> more      space in your garden-there are a few other standouts      from the 1982 trials that shouldn't be overlooked. I was      delighted with the performance of Flare rhubarb (Gurney and      Field), Grand Beurre artichoke (T & M), Dimant (T &      M) and Green Giant (Johnny's) celery, Sunbird Hybrid      sunflower (Burpee), Gold Coast Dwarf okra (Porter), and      California 500 asparagus (Henry Field).    </p>    <p>      A considerable number of fine berries warranted review, as      well <em>...</em> including Dormanred raspberry from      Hastings (this one makes a terrific pie!) <em>...</em>      Tayberry (a blackberry/redraspberry cross from Henry Field)      <em>...</em> and Red Honey strawberry (again, from Field).      Park's Big Red strawberry makes for excellent eating, too,      and Luscious Lady (Gurney) and Shortcake (Burpee) are a      pair of the better new everbearing varieties.    </p>    <h3>THE BEST BETS</h3>    <p>      With such an impressive selection of new cultivars (and      time-tested old standbys) in the seed catalogs this year,      you're sure to reap an abundant harvest from your 1983      garden <em>...</em> <em>especially</em> if you sow the      following "can't miss" varieties: Red Salad Bowl lettuce      <em>...</em> Prime Time cabbage <em>...</em> Pride And Joy      sweet corn <em>...</em> Gold Crest and Peter Pan summer      squash <em>...</em> Sweet Success and Euro-American      cucumbers <em>...</em> Chando cantaloupe <em>...</em> Royal      jubilee watermelon <em>...</em> Gourmet green beans      <em>...</em> Big Pick, Quick Pick, Caracas, Baron, and      Tempo tomatoes ... Skipper pepper ... Waltham Butternut      winter squash ... and Big Red strawberries.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Most of the varieties mentioned in this      article can be found at seed and garden suppliers, or they      can be ordered by mail directly from the seed companies.
