                    <p>      For many people, an important part of living the American      Dream involves having the chance to take a stab at being      one's own boss ... by picking up on an idea and turning it      into a profitable reality. And now, when a lot of folks are      actively seeking career changes (by choice <em>or</em>      necessity), it may just be the <em>ideal</em> time to test      those entrepreneurial waters.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the statistics regarding annual new business      start-ups and failures can be alarming. It seems that      roughly eight of every ten new ventures <em>fail</em>      within five years ... but there's no reason why yours can't      be one of the 20% that survive and prosper! To help insure      that'll happen, however, it's a good idea to study some of      the available literature on the subject, and to consult      with as many professionals as possible.    </p>    <p>      No business activity should, for example, be undertaken      without the advice of lawyers and accountants, and a smart      entrepreneur will also enlist the aid of the nearest field      office of the Small Business Administration (SBA), the only      federal government agency specifically set up to assist the      potential (or practicing) small-business person.    </p>    <h3>GET ORGANIZED</h3>    <p>      First of all, you need to establish a business plan that      outlines [a] your objectives, [b] your potential market,      [c] your plan for <em>reaching</em> that market, and [d]      your method of operating the business. Before you take even      the <em>first</em> step toward locating financial backers,      you should have those items thought out ... and the answers      presented in writing. After all, no investor can be      expected to take an interest in sponsoring your venture if      you haven't shown enough interest in it <em>yourself</em>      to set down a detailed plan of action.    </p>    <p>      However, once you've established your course-and      assuming that you yourself don't have the capital necessary      to implement your program-the next step is to locate      financing. Your first stop should be the office of the      nearest commercial banker. You see, although you might not      succeed at getting a business loan from that institution,      banking personnel-who generally have a wealth of      contacts in the community-may be able to both advise      you of <em>and</em> point you toward potential private      investors in your area.    </p>    <p>      There's yet another advantage to be gained by seeking help      at a bank: Once you've been turned down by at least one      commercial lender, you see, you can contact the Small      Business Administration for assistance in locating funds.      In fact, the SBA <em>itself</em> can guarantee loans up to      $500,000, at an interest rate not more than 2-3/4% over      prime. Since the money involved is still bank money,      though, it's wise to keep in mind that most lending      institutions will expect you to produce $1.50 worth of      collateral for every $1.00 you seek to borrow.    </p>    <p>      Commercial finance institutions, smallbusiness investment      companies, and business development corporations are other      possible sources of loans. Friends and family members can      also be helpful sometimes ... but-in such a      case-it is necessary to be sure the loan is made in      an appropriately professional manner, complete with a      signed contract detailing the amount borrowed, the fixed      rate of interest, <em>and</em> an outlined schedule of      repayment.    </p>    <h3>FORMING A FIRM</h3>    <p>      Legally speaking, there are several ways to organize a new      business. Most folks begin with a "sole proprietorship",      which is the least complicated form. The owner is the      business in this instance, so all of the enterprise's      liabilities are assumed by the individual. Although there's      no need to have a lot of contracts or other legal documents      drawn up for a sole proprietorship arrangement, the      assistance of a good lawyer is still recommended. He or she      will see you through the process of obtaining all the      necessary permits and help you outline your tax      obligations.    </p>    <p>      Then again, you may find it necessary (or advantageous) to      take a partner when you set up your new venture. A      <em>general partnership</em> represents a relationship      between two (or more) individuals who have joined together      to carry on a trade or business for profit. Each partner is      fully liable for the firm's obligations-unless the      partnership agreement specifically restricts those      liabilities <em>and</em> meets certain other legal      requirements for a <em>limited partnership</em> -      <em>and each</em> partner's share of the profits or losses      is reported on his or her individual tax return. One      primary disadvantage inherent in establishing a partnership      is that-when you do-you're legally responsible      not only for your business actions but often for the      actions of each of your <em>partners,</em> as well!    </p>    <p>      Corporations are the "robots" of the business world. Each      is a legal entity that's separate from the principal      participants involved. It's therefore liable for its own      debts and taxes, and it's also given the freedom to      distribute profits as it sees fit. A corporation is headed      by a board of directors, whose job it is to guide policy.      The actual owners of corporations are listed as      stockholders, and one "partner" can sell his or her shares      of stock in the company without necessarily dissolving the      business. However, because incorporation is such a detailed      and expensive process, most small-time entrepreneurs avoid      it until such time as their businesses really "take off and      roll".    </p>    <p>      Small enterprises also have the option of forming a      corporation under a governmental "Subchapter S"      designation. In this case, the shareholders of the      corporation elect to be taxed <em>individually</em> for      their proportionate share of profits and losses. To qualify      for this classification, a company must have fewer than ten      shareholders, be a totally domestic operation, offer only      one class, of stock, and consist of shareholders who are      all United States citizens and residents.    </p>    <h3>ACQUIRING INSURANCE</h3>    <p>      Be sure to enlist the aid of a competent and experienced      insurance broker when you begin to put together your new      venture-for-profit. Insurance is a complicated business and      is becoming more so each day. Some types will likely be      required by law, while other kinds can be considered smart      investments ... since they can protect your personal assets      <em>and</em> those of your business.    </p>    <p>      To cover areas of <em>physical loss,</em> you'll need      policies protecting your enterprise against fire,      lightning, wind, flood, vandalism, riots, robbery or      burglary, casualty, and damage resulting from use and      occupancy ... plus "extended coverage" protection to guard      against explosions, smoke damage, or bad storms. If you      lease a site, rather than own a building outright, be      certain that the agreement spells out which insurance      obligations are yours as tenant, and which are the      responsibility of the owner.    </p>    <p>      The "family" of policies that relate to <em>personal injury      claims</em> includes public liability, worker's      compensation, employer's liability, and product liability.      And there are still other types of protection that could be      important, depending on the nature of your business. These      include life insurance . .. automobile insurance ... and      policies that cover health and accidents, business      interruption, income continuance, and the bonding of      employees.    </p>    <h3>OTHER LEGALITIES</h3>    <p>      Licenses, permits, and other legal matters are very real      (and often annoying) aspects of small-business ownership.      Again, a good attorney will be most helpful in assisting      you as you slice your way through all the necessary red      tape.    </p>    <p>      Most businesses require a federal identification number, a      state retail sales license (if the enterprise involves      selling), a city occupational license, and (perhaps) even a      county merchant's license. <em>Permits</em> are generally      issued on an annual basis, require accompanying fees, and      often involve some kind of written application.    </p>    <p>      The government will-on request-issue you an      employer identification number <em>...</em> which you'll be      expected to use on all business returns, documents, and      statements made in connection with the enterprise. However,      the individual owner's social security number will still be      required on income tax returns, self-employment schedules,      and declarations of estimated tax.    </p>    <p>      If you operate your new venture under any name but your      own, you'll need to register it with a local government      agency. This regulation is known as the AKA/DBA law      (meaning "also known as . . ." or "doing business as . .      ."). Some areas may require you to publish the registration      in the classified section of your local newspaper.    </p>    <p>      Certain kinds of businesses require special permits. For      example, any restaurant (or a shop that sells food) will      have to obtain a permit from the county health department.      (This also means opening yourself up to on-the-spot,      unannounced inspections of your premises by county      officials.) Hairdressers, auto repair shops, exterminators,      real estate firms, and insurance agencies are examples of      other businesses that usually require special occupational      licensing from the state. Federal <em>licensing, on</em>      the other hand, is generally required only for gun dealers,      security and investment brokers, television and radio      stations, and pharmaceutical firms.    </p>    <p>      Whenever you sell a product directly to the public, you      have to charge sales tax. (Certain items <em>are</em>      exempt, but these will vary from state to state.) Nowadays,      many states require that you post a bond-or pay an      advance deposit-against future sales tax when you      apply for a permit. In exchange, you'll be issued the      permit <em>and</em> a "resale number", which will      effectively legitimize your retail operation.    </p>    <p>      Another legislative "headache" that must be dealt with      concerns the myriad zoning regulations found in most      communities. If you're operating a quiet business out of      your home, of course, it's unlikely that you'll encounter      any hassles from the zoning board. However, if your      operation is clearly a retail or manufacturing enterprise,      you should be well aware of the limitations imposed on you      by local ordinances. (Be especially aware of these      restrictions when you shop for a piece of property with the      intention of establishing a business on it.)    </p>    <h3>TAX TIPS</h3>    <p>      There are many tax advantages to owning your own business.      But before you begin operating as an independent, remember      that you <em>cannot deduct</em> expenses that you haven't      kept track of. Therefore, you must make record-keeping an      automatic part of your day-to-day existence. If you're      operating a sole proprietorship, the tax form that applies      to you is Schedule C-1040, and it's available from the      Internal Revenue Service upon request.    </p>    <p>      This form will detail a number of the deductions that you      can take. For example, you should be able to claim some of      the expense of maintaining your car if you use your vehicle      to conduct business activities.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, you could receive a tax credit for hiring help      that meets federal "minority" or "handicapped" status. And      if you join professional groups or trade organizations      relevant to your work, you can deduct those membership      fees, as well as the travel expenses to and from the      groups' conventions or conferences. Working from your home      sometimes allows you to claim a certain percentage of your      household costs as business expense, too.    </p>    <h3>ADVERTISING ADVICE</h3>    <p>      The greatest idea in the world will fizzle out fast if      people don't <em>know</em> about it, so a vitally important      part of your business will be getting word of your goods or      services to the market you hope to reach.    </p>    <p>      One of the best means of promotion-particularly if the      business you're establishing is <em>service</em>      -oriented-is a listing in your local telephone      company's Yellow Pages under an appropriate heading. Find      out what the charges are and when the directory goes to      press <em>...</em> then be sure to submit your information      well in advance of that date.    </p>    <p>      If you're operating a retail outlet, you'll find that a      large window sign can be an easy and inexpensive way to      announce the forth-coming business. Likewise, a simple      handbill or flyer that can be posted on community bulletin      boards (in the coin laundry or supermarket, for example)      will also help make your offerings known to the general      public.    </p>    <p>      In addition, nowadays most communities have a weekly      "shopper" newspaper that serves as an inexpensive way to      advertise services or wares (and if your area doesn't have      one, <em>starting</em> such a publication would be a good      business for you to consider). A few lines in      that-and/or in the classified section of your "real"      newspaper-will always be a good advertising bet.    </p>    <p>      As your business and profits grow, you may be able to      expand your promotional efforts to include large display      ads in newspapers and magazines, radio and television      messages, or a direct mail campaign.    </p>    <h3>YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN!</h3>    <p>      If and when you do decide to break away and try to succeed      as a self-employed person, you'll quickly find yourself      getting the kind of education that's not to be found in      books. This article is meant to serve only as a general      overview. It's certainly not intended to replace the      excellent advice to be had from bankers, lawyers,      accountants, and others who make a business of businesses.      Do keep in mind, as you plan, that it's a rare venture that      creates <em>substantial</em> profits during its first few      years. As you make financial projections, see that you have      enough capital on hand to maintain you and your family      until your company gets a fair crack at achieving success.      Given enough planning and persistence, however, you'll more      than likely find that you are able to make <em>your</em>      American Dream come true.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: For a specific example of a      small-business beginning, see the article on page 76.</em>    </p>
