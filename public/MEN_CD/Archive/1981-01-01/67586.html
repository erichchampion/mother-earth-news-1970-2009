                <p>      Provide your young 'uns with hours of enjoyment by creating      this simple, old-fashioned toy.    </p>               <p>      One sultry summer's evening about 20 years ago, my      grandfather-who was quite an ingenious old      gentleman-sat whittling away on the back porch while      Grandma cooked supper for the family. When Grandpa turned      his finished handiwork over to me, I found it was a new      plaything . . . and one that kept me fascinated for days      afterward.    </p>    <p>      Granddaddy's clothespin popper is an easy-to-put-together      homespun toy that you can <em>make</em> for your youngsters      (or your grandchildren) in just a few minutes . . . using      only a handful of common household items. All you'll need      to fashion one of the child-pleasers are two spring-type      clothespins, a pocketknife, and a strong rubber band.    </p>    <p>      First, remove the spring from one of the clothespins, pick      up your whittling knife, and square off the rounded inner      notch on <em>one</em> of the halves (see the accompanying      diagram) . . . and on the same wooden piece use the point      of the knife to deepen the <em>outside</em> notch just a      bit. Then put the two sections back together . . . wrap a      rubber band several times around their tapered ends . . .      and mount the spring, as in the drawing, so that its round      coil is on top of the toy.    </p>    <p>      The other clothespin, when it's taken apart, will provide      two rounds of "ammunition" for your popper. Simply whittle      away about 1/8" from- <em>and</em> square      off-the tapered end of each piece, and you (or an      eager youngster) will be able to wedge the stick into the      popper. Cock the "trigger"-or spring coil-by      sliding one of the tapered pieces, as in the illustration,      into the popper until it pushes the inside lever of the      spring into the square notch you whittled out. (If the      spring won't stay in place, you'll have to take the device      apart and carve the "catch" a little deeper . . . so that      it's closer to a right angle.) Then position the popper's      "ammunition" Justin front of that ledge. (Wrap the rubber      band tightly enough to lodge the "shell" snugly between the      jaws of the popper.)    </p>    <p>      At this point, the down-home toy is ready for action. Hold      it (with its open end pointing away from you) by grasping      the bottom section between your thumb and index finger.      Then aim the device at the ceiling-or at a soft,      unbreakable object-and pull the trigger toward you      with your other forefinger. (You'll probably find that you      need to balance the rubber band end of the popper with the      thumb of your "trigger" hand.) The spring lever will push      forward and send the pin flying 10 or 20 feet.    </p>    <p>      Once you've tested the popper, remind the young'uns to      point their new toy at <em>things</em> instead of people .      . . and then let them try out Grandpa's invention. They're      sure to have as much fun with the old-fangled plaything as      I did!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: You can find a few more ambitious projects      in "Old-Timey Toys", the centerfold feature in MOTHER NO.      66 . . . a copy can be ordered, for $3.00 plus $1.00      shipping and handling, from THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted),      P.O.
