                <p>      In 1976, Tom Ferguson-then a fourth-year medical      student at Yale-launched a magazine called Medical      Self-Care . . . which-he hoped-would serve as      "a Whole Earth Catalog of the best medical books, tools,      and resources".    </p>    <p>      Tom spoke of his plans for the publication-and of his      conviction that self-care could raise the general level of      health in this country and lower our inflated levels of      medical spending-in the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO. 51      . . . and left no doubt that he would work toward making      those "dreams "come true.    </p>    <p>      Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson now, and the medical      self-care "movement"-as well as Tom's magazine-has      flourished. People are beginning to assume more      responsibility for their own well-being and are eager for      information that will help them take better care of their      bodies.    </p>    <p>      So-in an effort to provide just such very necessary      data-THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> offers as a regular feature a      piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D., entitled (what else?) "Medical      SelfCare ".    </p>    <p>      <strong>Medical Self-Care</strong>    </p>        <p>      Millions of law-abiding North Americans are physically      addicted to caffeine-a potent central nervous system      (CNS ) stimulant-and aren't even aware of it. When      deprived of their "fix", such addicts often experience      severe withdrawal symptoms . . . which may include      depression, throbbing headaches, disorientation,      constipation, nausea, sluggishness, and irritability. And,      as with other addictive drugs, heavy users often develop a      tolerance, and require even higher doses to obtain the      desired effects.    </p>    <p>      This much-abused substance causes a dramatic increase in      muscle tension and stomach acid secretion, and      can-when taken in the form of two to three cups of      coffee-raise the blood pressure by as much as 14%.      Caffeine also produces a marked increase in the rate at      which oxygen is used by the cells . . . and has been      implicated as a possible contributing factor in birth      defects and fibrocystic breast disease. (In fact, extremely      large doses are potentially fatal.)    </p>    <p>      In spite of its potency, caffeine has only one medical use      . . . the treatment of poisoning by CNS depressants. In      fact, if caffeine were a newly synthesized drug, its      manufacturers would have great difficulty getting it      licensed for sale . . . and if it <em>were</em> licensed,      it would certainly be available only by prescription.    </p>    <p>      Yet more than two <em>billion</em> pounds of coffee are      consumed in this country each year. And caffeine is      <em>also</em> found in teas, cola drinks, chocolate, and      many over-the-counter "medicines".    </p>    <h3>A CASE OF CAFFEINISM</h3>    <p>      People's reactions to caffeine differ greatly, but an      intake above one's Individual limit-whatever that may      be-produces "caffeinism", a condition with symptoms      indistinguishable from those of anxiety neurosis: extreme      nervousness, irritability, tremulousness, chronic muscle      tension, difficulty falling asleep, trouble sleeping      soundly, sensory disturbances, increased frequency of      urination, frequent loose stools, gastrointestinal upsets,      and those alarmingly strong and rapid heartbeats that are      known <em>as</em> palpitations.    </p>    <p>      However, in spite of caffeine's harmful effects, a      researcher who recently reviewed the medical records of 100      randomly selected psychiatric outpatients found that not a      single form contained any information about the person's      tea or coffee habits, although 42% of the records made      <em>mention</em> of anxiety symptoms. (One wonders just how      many tranquiliz er prescriptions have been handed out to      clients suffering from undiagnosed caffeinism . . . a      condition that's estimated to affect up to 15% of all      Americans.)    </p>    <p>      Most surveys of U.S. coffee drinkers agree that about 25%      consume at least five cups of coffee per day . . . a      caffeine dose of 500-600 milligrams (mg.). Various      researchers have used values ranging from 200 mg. to 750      mg. of caffeine per day as presumed "danger points", above      which one is assumed to be at a high risk of caffeinism.      (Since the drug's effects depend on both dose and body      weight, a young child who drinks one cola may experience      the same problems-irritability, irregular heartbeats,      insomnia-as does an adult who has four cups of      coffee.)    </p>    <p>      A lethal dose of caffeine for a healthy, adult male is      approximately 10 grams, the equivalent of 80-100 cups of      coffee, but-because our bodies can break down      caffeine and excrete it rapidly-deaths from overdoses      of the stimulant are virtually unknown.    </p>    <p>      However, both moderate <em>and</em> heavy coffee drinkers      can experience withdrawal symptoms if they go without      caffeine for 24 hours. For most people, the first sign of      deprivation is a headache that may develop as early as 18      hours after their last "fix". It typically begins with a      feeling of cerebral fullness and progresses to a diffused,      painful throbbing that's frequently made worse by exercise      . . . but is, of course, relieved by drinking coffee or      tea, or taking a caffeine-containing pain remedy such as      Anacin, Vanquish, Excedrin, etc.    </p>    <h3>SPECIAL CAFFEINE RISKS</h3>    <p>      The caffeine equivalent of five to six cups of coffee per      day has been shown to increase the risk of birth defects in      laboratory animals . . . and one recent study showed that,      among women who exceeded 600 mg. of caffeine per day, only      one in 16 had a normal delivery. The other 15 pregnancies      ended in spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, or premature      birth.    </p>    <p>      An Ohio State researcher found that many women with      fibrocystic breast disease (benign breast lumps) could      shrink or eliminate the cysts by cutting caffeine from      their diets. In fact, in 65% of the women observed, these      problems disappeared <em>completely</em> within two to six      months after giving up the drug.    </p>    <p>      Studies on the correlation between caffeine and heart      problems are in conflict, but‚Äùuntil this controversy      is settled-it would seem wise for people with heart      disease or high blood pressure to confine their caffeine      intake to low levels.    </p>    <h3>WATCH YOUR HABIT</h3>    <p>      Though caffeine can be a useful tool at times, many people      who decide to reduce or eliminate this substance altogether      experience an improvement in the quality of their lives.      Here are some things to keep in mind when trying to      determine just how great a role caffeine plays in      <em>your</em> life:    </p>    <p>      Most folks tend to substantially underestimate their      caffeine intake . . . so try maintaining a log to learn how      much you really consume.    </p>    <p>      Remember that reactions to this drug are <em>extremely</em>      variable. Some people can't touch it, while others ingest      substantial amounts without undesired results. Also, an      individual's response can change over time.    </p>    <p>      If you decide to eliminate caffeine, consider tapering off.      If you stop "cold turkey", you may experience a headache or      morning drowsiness for as long as a week. (One way to cut      back is to mix decaffeinated coffee half and half with your      regular brew. Tea can also help a heavy addict taper down,      as the average cup of the beverage contains less than half      the caffeine of brewed coffee.)    </p>    <p>      Consider, too, using nonliquid coffee substitutes. Many say      that caffeine helps "get them going" . . . but a short      morning run, 15 minutes of yoga, or a brief meditation      session may have the same <em>positive</em> effect . . .      <em>without</em> any of the negative ones.    </p>    <p>      At any rate, experiment with your caffeine intake.      Consider, perhaps, going for a week without coffee to see      how it feels. One friend who recently did just that decided      afterward to use caffeine only occasionally.    </p>    <p>      "I feel I'm so much more in control of my life . . . even      emotionally! " she explained. "Before, I was always      rushing. Now I'm moving at my proper pace. It's so nice to      wake up in the morning without the need to drink something      in order to function."    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Tom Ferguson's son's quarterly journal,      Medical Self-Care, is available for $15 per year from      Medical Self-Care, Dept.
