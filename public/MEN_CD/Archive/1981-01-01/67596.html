                <p>      There's more than <em>one</em> way to beat the high cost of      heating fuel!<br /></p>			      <h5 id="byline">By Lisa Anderson    </h5>        <p>      One cold winter morning-as I went about my usual      daily routine-I answered the doorbell . . . to find      an absolutely <em>dumbstruck</em> UPS delivery man standing      on the front steps. He was motionless for at least a full      minute . . . gazing at me in speechless bewilderment!    </p>    <p>      I stared back with curiosity, and wondered (briefly) what      was wrong with the poor fellow. Then I remembered that I      had come to the door in my snuggler sack,      which-although odd enough in itself-was made      <em>more</em> comical by the added bulkiness of the down      warm-up pants and jacket that I wore underneath it.    </p>    <p>      Of course, my "below-zero" boots may also have caught the      man off guard . . . they <em>did</em> add a certain      elephantine effect to my lower extremities. And I'm sure      the old kerchief around my head did nothing to diminish the      peculiarity of my appearance.    </p>    <p>      Ah yes, I concluded after a moment's hesitation, this      particular delivery person has obviously never knocked on      my door before! I felt compelled to explain my apparel.    </p>    <p>      "I'm dressed this way because we keep our thermostat set at      48째."    </p>    <p>      "Forty-eight?" the bewildered carrier repeated. "Don't you      <em>freeze?"</em>    </p>    <p>      He just wouldn't believe that my husband Tom and I remain      perfectly comfortable in a chilly environment that not only      saves fuel, but helps us keep our health-and stick to      our budget-as well!    </p>    <h3>A PORTABLE ENVIRONMENT</h3>    <p>      Before Old Man Winter reared his forbidding head last year,      you see, we had to decide whether or not to install      woodburning stoves in our home. We knew we'd need      <em>four</em> of the heaters to keep the sprawling house      comfortable . . . and the alternatives to using multiple      heat sources-such as breaking through the walls and      installing ducts to channel warm air from one stove into      <em>all</em> the rooms, or putting in a full-scale      woodburning furnace-were <em>expensive.</em> And once      we figured in the cost of wood (which is by <em>no</em>      means exempt from inflation), none of these schemes enticed      us any longer. Nor did we relish the idea of lugging logs,      stoking stoves, and cleaning chimneys all season long!    </p>    <p>      So, after several days spent debating our heating options,      I suggested to Tom that we create <em>portable</em>      environments for ourselves. When he responded with only a      blank expression, I explained that-from time      immemorial-people who live in northern China have      shielded themselves from the cold by wearing quilted      jackets, pants, and boots. And, while Tom <em>still</em>      looked a tad doubtful, I warmed to the idea and began to      retrieve some of the various mail order catalogs that      periodically appear in our mailbox.    </p>    <p>      Together, my husband and I compiled a list of wearing      apparel that would-we hoped-keep us toasty at a      thermostat setting of 48째 F. The list included daytime      garments such as down-filled jackets, pants, boots, and      snuggler sacks, as well as a few extras that would insure a      comfortable night's sleep. [EDITOR'S NOTE: For an      individual price breakdown of the items the Andersons      purchased-and a list of the sources that they bought      from-see the accompanying sidebar.]    </p>    <p>      The total cost for each of us came to $332.40, making the      venture less expen sive than any of the heating      alternatives we had discussed. And our investment <em>paid      for itself</em> that first season! (We found that we used      60% less heating oil <em>and</em> 10% less electricity than      we had during previous Winters.)    </p>    <h3>AND NOT ONLY THAT . . .</h3>    <p>      Since we made our decision to live in a cold house, we've      finally achieved, in retirement, what had eluded us in      earlier years <em>. . . hardy</em> constitutions. We're      enjoying absolutely <em>vigorous</em> health, more energy,      and restful sleep . . . all of which are fringe benefits of      our new, frugal lifestyle. Furthermore, we're no longer      plagued with colds or weight problems, yet such added      advantages came as a complete. surprise. All we'd      <em>intended</em> to do was conserve heating oil.    </p>    <h3>HOW IT WORKS</h3>    <p>      When I'm dressed in my "winter uniform", my body produces      heat, every time I move, within the down garments.      If-while I'm sitting down, for example-I find      myself ,getting chilled, I can generate warmth by simply      flexing the muscles of my back, arms, hands, and feet.      (Just wiggling my toes is a very effective heatproducer!)    </p>    <p>      Of course, each person will have his or her individual      "comfortable" temperature level, so I'd suggest you      purchase down-filled clothing one size larger than you'd      normally wear . . . to allow for any extra layers of      garments that you might want to add. I've always been      sensitive to the cold, so <em>my</em> daytime wardrobe      consists of an undershirt, tights, long underwear, a cotton      turtleneck, a shetland pullover, a cardigan, warm slacks,      and-over all of <em>that</em> -down pants and a      jacket. (The sack is necessary only for sedentary work.)    </p>    <p>      I've also discovered, during my quest for warmth in a cold      house, that a considerable amount of body heat escapes      through the 'head. Therefore, I started wearing a kerchief      both day and night. (You could wear a wig if you prefer . .      . or choose a hooded parka instead of a jacket.)    </p>    <h3>BULK IS BETTER</h3>    <p>      Although I may look double my size, I'm not even aware of      the extra clothes on my body anymore . . . primarily      because goose down imparts warmth without adding much      weight. Of course, there are synthetic insulation materials      on the market today, such as Thinsulate (manufactured by      the 3M Company), which are supposedly as warm as down but      not nearly so bulky. (Still, <em>we're</em> partial to the      fluffy feathered filling.)    </p>    <p>      My neighbors often ask me how I manage to cook and clean      while swathed in such an outfit. Actually, I've become      quite adept at moving about . . . even in the snuggler      sack. However, I'd still suggest that "bundling beginners"      steer clear of precious breakables . . . you'll soon find      you're bigger than you think!    </p>    <p>      When doing <em>heavy</em> housework, I'm usually able to      get by with fewer layers than are needed while sewing,      reading, etc. The labor itself generates enough heat to      keep me cozy.    </p>    <p>      (You may wonder how we manage to entertain guests. Well,      we're <em>planning</em> to acquire enough sacks to keep our      visitors snug. In the meantime, though, we simply turn up      one of our three thermostats an hour or so before we expect      company.)    </p>    <h3>WATCH THE WIND</h3>    <p>      "Portable environment people" will find that as the mercury      plummets, the house will actually seem <em>warmer,</em>      since the heaters will go on when room temperature drops      below 48째. (The occasional warmth from the radiators      will come as a pleasant surprise. But remember that even if      the thermostat-which is usually located on an inside      wall-registers a balmy 48째, your house may      actually be five to eight degrees cooler near the outside      walls and windows . . . particularly on a windy day.)    </p>    <h3>TEPEFY THE TUMMY WITH TOASTED      TREATS</h3>    <p>      At one point during that first "bundling" winter, I thought      our refrigerator was on the blink . . . since it seemed      comparatively warm. Then I realized that <em>my entire      kitchen</em> had become an icebox except during those times      when I used <em>my</em> stove.    </p>    <p>      The situation has its fringe benefits, of course. For      instance, I can store wholesale quantities of apples and      citrus fruits anywhere in the house with little chance of      spoilage. And my Christmas greenery remains attractive for      months, without shedding a <em>single</em> needle. In fact,      even <em>my</em> palms and potted bulbs do exceptionally      well, with the latter retaining their blossoms much longer      than they would in a warm house. But I've found it best to      reduce the amount of water I give my houseplants by at      least one half.    </p>    <p>      It's important to note that cold food-especially when      it's consumed in a cold environment-will cause your      body temperature to <em>plunge.</em> After experiencing      just one chilling meal, I acquired the habit of placing      such normally cold foods as fruit, yogurt, cheese, and      juices-as well as plates-into my warming oven      for half an hour before serving them. (Watch the cheese,      though . . . some types will get runny when warmed.)    </p>    <p>      If you work at a desk for long periods of time, as I do,      your circulation will become sluggish after several hours      of sitting. Keep a pot of tea nearby for such occasions.      Besides sipping the hot brew, you can occasionally warm      your hands on the pot.    </p>    <h3>THINK WARM TO BE WARM . . . AND      OTHER TIPS</h3>    <p>      I find autosuggestion to be very helpful when washing,      dressing, and undressing in the cold. So I suggest      that-when you first get up in the morning-you      take a deep breath and "think warm". Here's my routine:    </p>    <p>      Before busying myself in the bathroom each day, I place my      undergarment layers beneath the blankets . . . by the time      I'm ready to put them on, they're warm.    </p>    <p>      After bathing, I finish up with a splash of cold water.      Once that shock has passed and I'm briskly towel-dried, my      skin glows and tingles and the air doesn't seem so cold.      (When shampooing my hair, though, I splurge and warm the      room to 55째F . . . which, after 48째-believe      me-feels almost tropical!)    </p>    <p>      A rubdown with oil is my favorite way to end the cold-water      treatment . . . and I find corn oil mixed with a dash of      lemon juice to be an excellent, <em>inexpensive</em>      substitute for the fancy liquids offered at the cosmetic      counter.    </p>    <p>      As I write this, I often check the temperature at my desk      to make certain I'm reporting the facts accurately. It's no      exaggeration to say that, as I sit here in my snuggler      sack, I feel <em>more</em> comfortable than I did during      the "72째F" era of my life. I'm impervious to drafts,      and the down cocoon provides an even and constant warmth.    </p>    <p>      And what is the temperature at my desk? A balmy <em>forty      degrees!</em>    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: For some additional coldweather clothing      ideas, turn to "Snug-As-A-Bug Sleeper", on Page 192.    </p>
