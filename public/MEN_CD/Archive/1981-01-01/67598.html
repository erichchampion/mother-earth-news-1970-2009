    <p>
                <p>      MOTHER's globe-trotting travelers are back, with a report      on . . .    </p>                                <p>      There's no question that fortune smiled on MOTHER's recent      tour to the People's Republic of China. We were able to      visit such locations as Kunming, Chengdu, and Nanning, as      yet "unwesternized" by the influences of tourism and only      recently opened to visitors . . . and that made us feel      <em>especially</em> privileged when we talked, later, to      other travelers stuck in such already beaten paths as the      Beijing/Guilin/Shanghai/Guangzhou route.    </p>    <h3>TOURIST "MUSTS"</h3>    <p>      Of course, we <em>did</em> make certain-during our      short stay in Beijing-that we climbed the Great Wall      (it's steep!), explored the gorgeous symmetry of the      Forbidden City, visited the Ming Tombs, and took a      leisurely tour of the stunningly beautiful Summer Palace.    </p>    <p>      We even had opportunities to join the capital city's      citizens (at least those of us who got up early enough      did!) in their morning exercises . . . to observe with awe      the thousands of rushhour bicyclists pedaling safely in      wide, clearly marked lanes . . . and to visit the famous      Red Star Commune, where (among other things) we cheered a      cow on as she gave birth to a healthy calf, and looked on      unhappily while Peking ducks were forcefed to make fat      future dinners.    </p>    <h3>THE "REAL" CHINA</h3>    <p>      But when we headed for more distant provinces, we came face      to face with an even more interesting China. The experience      began on the evening that we walked out of our Chengdu      hotel and found a number of people waiting for us . . . to      "practice their English".    </p>    <p>      It's remarkable how fluently such men and women can      converse after only two or three years of lessons. That      first night, for example, we were accosted by two      attractive high school girls who were extraordinarily      concerned about the outcome of the American presidential      election, and disappointed that we couldn't predict the      outcome.    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, we found that <em>no</em> subjects-even      military matters-were taboo to the often      well-informed people we encountered, and answers to      <em>our</em> questions were obviously candid. At first,      when they said, "Let's walk while we talk," we thought we      were encountering signs of some form of national paranoia,      but it soon became evident that stopping on the streets (or      anywhere else) would immediately attract scores of      unabashedly curious onlookers.    </p>    <h3>ANOTHER KIND OF COMMUNISM</h3>    <p>      In great contrast to the citizens of the U.S.S.R.-who      always seem to feel the power of some sort of intangible      authoritarian "vibes"-the Chinese don't appear to      weigh their words <em>or</em> feel the slightest      nervousness when dealing with Westerners. This, of course,      was not true a few years ago. We heard unpleasant accounts      of the days of the Cultural Revolution, though some of the      people we met felt that their time served on communes (it's      no longer mandatory, but was required not long ago) had      been a good thing.    </p>    <p>      On the whole, however, the people claimed to be immensely      happy with the country's <em>new</em> regime ... which is,      seemingly, decentralizing power and making knowledge and      efficiency-rather than merely "good      Communism"-prerequisites for high positions in a land      eager to upgrade the standard of living of its populace.    </p>    <p>      There <em>were</em> still complaints, though . . . most of      them from young people, who have a strong desire for more      "personal freedom". At present, youths must work where      they're told, and have a great deal of trouble      <em>ever</em> changing their professions. (In order to keep      the nation's cities from becoming more crowded, the      government often forces people to take jobs in the areas      where their parents were born.)    </p>    <p>      Many of the Chinese, however, seem quite resigned to      fulfilling their slots in life in such a way. One      university student <em>did</em> complain that the teaching      job she would be assigned to would be "boring" . . . but      when we asked whether that fact made her angry, she only      smiled and said, "No, not really."    </p>    <p>      Others were more discontented. Our young high school      acquaintances, for instance, were furious because      "international dancing" (as they call disco/rock) had been      banned everywhere <em>except</em> in the schools. They also      commented, with some disgust, "The high officials have big      houses . . . but the people have little ones."    </p>    <h3>THE BASICS</h3>    <p>      Chinese housing, in fact, <em>often</em> leaves much to be      desired . . . yet rents average only 70 cents a month out      of an almost universal salary of $48 a month, and some of      the innovations in the small homes (such as carefully      designed one-family methane plants that provide free      lighting and fuel) are little short of amazing. (Look for a      how-to article detailing these "family-size digesters" in a      forthcoming issue of MOTHER.)    </p>    <p>      The average citizen's clothing, on the other hand, seems to      be perfectly adequate, and the nation's stores (again, in      comparison with those in the U.S.S.R.) are filled with      goods at reasonable prices . . . there's even a choice of      brands! Furthermore, health care is free, and people can      choose either traditional or Western medicine . . .      <em>or</em> a combination of both.    </p>    <p>      Food, as we had heard prior to our trip, is abundant.      Intensive, raised-bed gardening is evident everywhere      (this, too, will be described in detail in a future is      sue), and each spare inch of topsoil is put to agricultural      use . . . from highway right-of-ways to meter-wide ledges      dug out of steep mountainsides. The results were reflected      in well-fed, healthy-looking people . . . in booming "free      markets", where growers could sell their surplus produce .      . . in crowded restaurants . . . and in our own meals,      which usually ranged from 10 to 20 delicious courses. (We      did occasionally have to deal with such "delicacies" as      roasted sparrows with their heads still intact and fried      baby bees. However, the latter turned out to be      <em>quite</em> tasty . . . in fact, most of us couldn't      "eat just one"!)    </p>    <h3>AFTERTHOUGHTS</h3>    <p>      But the <em>best</em> thing about our trip to      China-in addition to the excellent food, the      efficient service, the ancient temples, the picture-book      parks, and all the other enchanting historical landmarks      that made this country so wonderful to visit-was the      opportunity to interact with its gentle, cheerful, caring      people and their well-loved, fearless children. Many of our      travelers remarked that despite-or maybe because      of-the lack of police or guards, they had never felt      safer or more comfortable anywhere . . . and several are      <em>already</em> planning to return the <em>next</em> time      MOTHER sponsors a China trip.    </p>    <p>      That "next time" <em>may</em> be next summer. . . but      perhaps won't take place until 1982. We're spoiled now, you      see, by the knowledge of a China that exists far away from      the "tourist track", so we're still holding out for      permission to visit <em>more</em> distant places (maybe      even Tibet!). If you'd like to make such a journey, let us      know (write the address given below) . . . and we'll      contact you as soon as we're granted visas.    </p>    <h3>IN THE MEANTIME</h3>    <p>      Until then, MOTHER has some other incredibly fine tours to      satisfy your wanderlust and your desire for practical      knowledge of the world: a Solar Tour of Israel (February 19      to March 3, 1981) . . . a Scandinavian Crafts Tour (May 5      to May 22, 1981) . . . a previously unannounced Sanctuaries      of Sri Lanka Tour (July 4 to 24, 1981) to study exotic      animals and birds under the guidance of that country's      Wildlife and Nature Protection Society . . . a Solar Tour      to England and France (August 23 to September 6, 1981) . .      . and a South Seas Seminar-with Paul and Anne      Ehrlich, and John and Cheri Holdren-that will take us      to Tahiti, Bora Bora, and Raiatea (November 27 to December      11, 1981).    </p>    <p>      And we're already lining up other exotic learning      experiences for 1982. Write to Mother's Tours (P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791) for more information,      or to put your name on our tour mailing list.    </p>
