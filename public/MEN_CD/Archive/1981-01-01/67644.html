                <p>      What do you get when you cross a 2 x 2 with a chain saw?      Why, a ...    </p>        <h5 id="byline">     By Wayne Fugate    </h5>    <p>      A dull chain saw can make cutting firewood a frustrating      and tiresome chore. And a do-it-yourself attempt at      <em>sharpening</em> the chain-especially when the job      is done by a novice-will often only make matters seem      worse.    </p>    <p>      But I've discovered, in <em>my</em> attempts to deal with      this never-ending problem, that a simple sharpening guide      fashioned from a scrap piece of wood can help a      do-it-yourselfer be sure that the teeth on <em>both</em>      sides of the chain are filed to the same angle (which, in      turn, will often prevent the bar from curving or binding).    </p>    <p>      The makeshift guide-which took me only      <em>minutes</em> to cobble up-also guards against the      many scratches, cuts, and burns that can occur during a      chain saw sharpening operation. Best of all, the filing aid      kept me from spending good money for a commercially      available, mass-produced sharpening brace.    </p>    <h3>HERE'S WHAT YOU DO</h3>    <p>      Find a straight-grained section of 2 X 2 hardwood that's      about 14" long. Mark the centerline on one side of the      board ... then nail the piece to another plank or-if      you prefer-clamp it in a vise.    </p>    <p>      Next, using your chain saw, carefully cut a groove 3/4"      deep and 10"-long at the centerline (Photo 1). Then,      measuring an overall length of 8 ", mark and cut the ends      (Photo 2) at opposing 60Â° angles (or to the angle      specified In your owner's manual).    </p>    <h3>NOW, TO SHARPEN . . .</h3>    <p>      Use the form by setting the groove over the chain ahead of      each tooth along the right side. (Be sure to allow 1/8"      clearance between the board and the file.) Then, as you      make your stroke (Photo 3), visually align your file with      the guide's end.    </p>    <p>      And how do you sharpen the left-hand teeth? Why, simply by      placing the opposite end of the block on top of the chain .      . .1/8" behind the teeth's leading or cutting edges!    </p>
