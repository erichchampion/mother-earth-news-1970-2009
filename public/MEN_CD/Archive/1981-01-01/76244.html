                <p>      For years no news was good news, but now information is      beginning to come in on . . .    </p>            <p>      If you've spent any time contemplating the curl of smoke      from a woodstove flue, you've probably wondered just what      was in that cloud . . . and whether it contained pollutants      that might someday be recognized as harmful. You may even      have heard that some communities-such as Vail,      Colorado-have been forced to restrict woodburning to      avert health hazards from haze, fly ash, and carbon      monoxide.    </p>    <p>      But, until just a few months ago, there was very little      solid technical information about the specific kinds and      quantities of emissions produced by residential woodfueled      appliances. Well, the facts are now beginning to come in,      and-though it will be a few years before scientists      have a <em>thorough</em> grasp on the scope of the      problem-the initial results are, for the most part,      depressing.    </p>    <p>      A study completed in June 1980 (it was carried out by the      Monsanto Corporation, at the request of the Environmental      Protection Agency) has shown that woodstoves, although they      produce <em>different</em> sorts of heavy emissions from      those associated with automobiles or power plants, do pose      significant pollution problems. It seems that woodburners,      especially the airtight models increasingly favored by      consumers, are major producers of what scientists call      <em>polycyclic organic matter</em> (POM). In fact, the      results of the <em>preliminary</em> study suggest that      residential woodstoves contribute more POM to the      atmosphere than all other sources of combustion combined!    </p>    <p>      The term "polycyclic" refers to a molecule that contains at      least two closed atomic rings, but the most important      aspect of POM-as far as we consumers are      concerned-is that many of the compounds classed under      the heading are known to be mutagens or carcinogens. Two of      the most toxic examples are benzo(a)pyrene and      dimethylbenzanthracene .. . but there were actually 25 POM      compounds (or subdivisions of them) identified by the      Monsanto study, plus miscellaneous aldehydes and other      organics.    </p>    <h3>EFFICIENT = DIRTY</h3>    <p>      In an attempt to categorize the severity of the problem      under differing combustion conditions, the Monsanto      teamworking at the Auburn University laboratories-tested      three different woodburning appliances using logs of green      <em>and</em> seasoned oak and pine . . . each at a variety      of draft settings. The results demonstrated conclusively      that the production of POM is a function of combustion      temperature . . . which-in most woodstoves-is      closely related to oxygen supply.    </p>    <p>      Therefore the fireplace insert that the group      tested-which burned its fuel supply relatively      rapidly, yielding efficiencies that peaked at roughly      25%-produced about 1/10 as much POM as did either a      baffled or unbaffled airtight. (In fact, the two airtight      stoves performed similarly, yielding efficiencies of      between 45 and 50%.) Quite clearly, limiting the rate of      combustion in a woodstove by reducing the air supply      <em>increases</em> POM emissions dramatically. In other      words, the more efficient the unit becomes, the more POM it      will produce.    </p>    <p>      But other factors also influence the rate of POM production      in a woodstove. The moisture content of the fuel, for      instance, has the direct effect of reducing combustion area      temperature . . . since the liquid must be evaporated      before the wood can burn. While the tests showed little      difference in the pollution produced by burning      green-as opposed to seasoned-oak, burning green pine      caused roughly a three-fold increase in POM emissions over      that of <em>either</em> of the two oak samples or of the      seasoned pine. This result suggests that the resinous      content of some softwoods has a tendency to increase POM      emissions.    </p>    <p>      Though the POM results were the most significant      discoveries made by the study, the research also showed      that rates of carbon monoxide production are influenced by      many of the same factors as are POM emissions. Again,      airtight stoves seem to be far greater polluters than are      their less efficient brethren. (We should also note,      however, that though woodburners are not heavy producers of      nitrous oxides, the higher temperatures that occurred in      the fireplace insert <em>did</em> yield more of that      particular pollutant than was produced by the more      efficient stoves.)    </p>    <h3>WHAT'S TO BE DONE?</h3>    <p>      We're not suggesting that you abandon your woodstove, nor      is the EPA currently contemplating any specific      restrictions on the production or use of such appliances.      (In comparison, after a study in Sweden similar to our      EPA's project yielded nearly identical results, woodburning      was-as of November 1980-strictly limited in      that country!) But we <em>are</em> suggesting that you      operate your woodburner in ways that tend to reduce      emissions!    </p>    <p>      The object of a clean stove-operating procedure is to      maintain the highest combustion temperatures possible. You      can help your stove accomplish this by using seasoned wood      (and, specifically, by not burning green pine!) and keeping      the draft at least partway open. (Ideally, this means      sacrificing-at least for the time being-a      smoldering all-night burn ... in return for cleaner air.      The choice is yours.)    </p>    <p>      You can also reduce POM and CO emissions by burning smaller      fires in your stove. Such an approach avoids the creation      of oxygen-starved areas in the firebox ... spots in which      heavy emissions tend to be produced. Furthermore, even      though there are no conclusive results to date, there seems      to be reason to believe that <em>lined</em> (with ceramic,      soapstone, etc.) fireboxes maintain hotter combustion than      do "bare" chambers.    </p>    <h3>SALVATION IN TECHNOLOGY?</h3>    <p>      A number of different companies and individuals have      recognized the dangers of woodstove emissions, and are      developing new products in an attempt to solve the problem.      For example, the Corning Glass Works has introduced a      catalytic converter-similar to the automotive      devices, but with much larger passages to accommodate lower      "exhaust" velocities and larger <em>particles</em>      -that <em>may</em> help strip flue gases of      pollutants while increasing overall stove efficiency.      Corning has <em>no</em> retrofit devices available at this      time, but Franklin Cast Products (a major importer of      Taiwan-made stoves) does have two woodburners-which,      at this writing, sell for about $1,000      apiece-equipped with Corning combustors.    </p>    <p>      Other research groups feel that the solution will involve      moving away from current airtight stove designs. Jotul of      Norway-while unwilling to divulge specific      information about work being carried out under its      $2,500,000 annual research budget-is rumored to be      working on a wood gas (pyrolysis) stove. (See page 194 of      this issue for more information on wood gasification.)      Still another possibility is to use high-temperature      furnaces (such as Hampton Technology's Jetstream), that      employ heat exchangers and storage systems. And, while      MOTHER is keeping a watchful eye on the corporate solutions      to our pollution problems, we're also keenly attentive to      work being done by individuals (such as the development of      Larry Dobson's sawdust stove, featured in MOTHER's Guide to      Home Energy).    </p>    <p>      We're confident that there are solutions to the problem,      and-in fact-MOTHER's research staff is busy      working on a number of retrofit approaches to lessening      emissions. What's more, we're doing our best to encourage      <em>others</em> to apply their knowledge to the effort. And      when the solutions do become available, you'll read about      them here!    </p>
