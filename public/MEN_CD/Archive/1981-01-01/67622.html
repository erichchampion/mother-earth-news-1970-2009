        <p>Eighteen "Positions and Situations" advertisers agreed to write inand tell you...</p><p>Have you ever wondered <em>who</em> responds to the advertisements in MOTHER's Positions and Situations column . . . about the experiences of the folks who run the listings . . . whether or not most of the tales have happy endings . . . in other words, just what in thunderation actually <em>happens</em> when a man or woman places an ad in P & S?</p><p>Well, MOTHER's staff <em>figured</em> some of you might be wondering about such things. We also thought that a few of our P & S people might welcome a chance to share their stories . . . along with, perhaps, some helpful advice to make the column even <em>more</em> useful for everyone. So MOM wrote to (and received replies from) a small, random-and definitely not scientific-sampling of recent Positions and Situations listers.</p><p>The down-home advertisers were eager to share the results, too, and we're going to tell you what they had to say . . . but <em>first</em>, we should emphasize that-since P & S is basically intended to be a column for private communication-we're going to refrain from identifying the kind folks who wrote us (and the justas-kind people who replied to <em>them!).</em></p><h3>P & S WRITER'S CRAMP</h3><p>The majority of the advertisers who wrote to us were quite surprised by the <em>number of</em> people who answered their listings. "I can sum up the response in one word: <em>overwhelming!"</em> said one. Others reported getting "dozens and dozens of letters", "so many that I'm still writing people back", and (in the case of one woman who kept count) "277 replies"!</p><p>These listers also pointed out that-although they may have been flattered by having so many respondents-they were <em>hard pressed</em> by the time required to reply individually to every letter (a courtesy MOTHER expects from all her Positions and Situations advertisers). That task was not always an easy one, either. As one busy scriber pointed out, "It's very difficult to compose the necessary 'thank you, but no thank you' letters."</p><p>Of course, some folks did not receive scores of replies . . . but most such individuals were "very happy" with the 10 to 16 sincere responses they <em>did</em> get.</p><p>A few people, however, were clearly <em>disappointed</em> with the feedback their listings evoked. One disheartened partnerhunter said, "Five people responded to my ad. Three of these did not answer my reply ... . and the other two weren't the type of people I had advertised for."</p><h3>WHO RESPONDS</h3><p>From what folks told us, the Positions and Situations column draws mail from a wide range of people: "from almost every state in the union" . . . "from coal miners, farmers, telephone repairmen, lawyers, craftsmen, and college professors" . . . "from some people with big, beautiful homesteading dreams-but no idea of the work involved-as well as from many others who are already leading lives that would make you folks at MOTHER proud".</p><p>Some men and women received a few letters from people whom they described as being "kooks". [EDITOR'S NOTE: Please, remember always to exercise cautious discretion when placing or answering a P& S.] But <em>all</em> of the column advertisers responding to our queries noted that "unwelcome" mail was rare: The vast majority of folks who replied to the magazine listings were-according to our "pollees" -amazingly sincere "MOTHER-type" people. (As one lad, who had previously tried four mail order "matching services", said: "Never have I received so much response from very honest, open, down-to-earth people.")</p><h3>THE VOICES OF EXPERIENCE</h3><p>A few people shared some useful experience-earned knowledge with us, too. One man, for example, learned that he should have stated <em>his own age . . . to</em> help reduce the number of inappropriate responses. (MORAL: If you run a P & S listing, <em>be</em> specific.)</p><p>Four different women wished that people who did <em>not</em> share their listed interests-concerning religion, locale, art, etc.-had not gone to the trouble of writing. (MORAL: <em>Answer</em> only the P & S listings that <em>clearly</em> apply to you.)</p><h3>A HAPPY ENDING</h3><p>In all, 18 people sent us their versions of "My P & S Story". Three of these folks were disappointed with the results of their advertisements . . . but the other 15 were quite pleased with-or even downright flabbergasted by-the number and quality of people who responded to their listings.</p><p>We can't sign off on this piece, though, without telling you of one-completely <em>un</em> solicited-letter that came in during the time this survey was taken. "As a result of my ad in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>Â°," the writer of this missive began, "I am now the radiant bride of a wonderful man. My new husband felt 'compelled' to answer my P & S listing the moment he read it . . . and I called him up on the telephone as soon as I received his response. During the next three weeks, we spent so much time talking on the line that we practically bought out the Arizona and Missouri phone companies! Finally-on June 11th-we met face to face . . . and on the 13th we were married. THANKS, MOM! "</p>
