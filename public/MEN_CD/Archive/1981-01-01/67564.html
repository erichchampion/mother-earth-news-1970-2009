            		<p>        Liven up your midwinter meals and snacks with some      wonderful homemade... Bagels and English Muffins</p>        <h5 id="byline">		 By Sally Young		 </h5>          <p>      Even though the nearest store is 120 miles from our Alaskan      home-and our one fall shopping trip must last the      family for seven months-we manage to provide      ourselves with all <em>kinds of</em> special goodies during      the long winter. For example, instead of buying such      "luxury" items as bagels-and English muffins, I keep      the cost of our grocery bill down by <em>baking</em> the      delicious breads at home.    </p>    <p>      The fact is that once an ambitious chef overcomes his or      her fear of the unknown, both of the distinctive "rolls"      are extremely easy to make and require no special      equipment. (You <em>will</em> find, though, that a tuna      can-opened on both ends-serves as an excellent      muffin cutter.)    </p>    <h3>WHOLE WHEAT ENGLISH MUFFINS</h3>    <p>      To prepare about 24 muffins, add 1/2 cup (1 stick) of      butter, 2-1/2 teaspoons of salt, and 1/4 cup of honey to 2      cups of scalded milk. Cool the liquid to lukewarm, and stir      in 2 packages of yeast dissolved in 1/2 cup of tepid water      . . . 2 beaten eggs ... and four cups of sifted whole wheat      flour. When all the ingredients are blended well, knead in      another 3 to 4 cups of flour . . . and then let the dough      rise until it's doubled in bulk.    </p>    <p>      When it's "up to size", cut the sweet-smelling lump into      two sections ... roll each piece out until it's about a      quarter inch thick . . . and use your converted tuna can to      cut the individual muffins. (Knead the trimmings until they      hold together . . . roll them out . . . cut more disks . .      . and repeat the process until all the dough is used up.)    </p>    <p>      Next, cover the dough "patties" and let them rise for about      half an hour. When the time is up, sprinkle cornmeal on an      ungreased griddle, cook the muffins until their undersides      are unevenly dark brown, then turn them over and "toast"      the tops.    </p>    <h3>WHOLE WHEAT BAGELS</h3>    <p>      Preparing bagels involves two separate cooking steps, but      the chewy goodness of the delicacies is more than worth the      extra effort involved in making them!    </p>    <p>      Dissolve 1 package of yeast and 2 tablespoons of honey in 2      cups of warm water. Add 2 cups of whole wheat flour and 2      teaspoons of salt . . . then stir the mixture until a soft      dough is formed. Turn it out on a floured board, and knead      the bagels-to-be-adding up to 3 more cups of flour as      necessary-to form a firm and nonsticky dough. Let it      rise until the mass doubles in size-usually about      1-1/2 hours-then punch it down and knead some more.      Divide the finished dough into 12 to 14 even pieces and      roll them into cylinders of about six inches in length . .      . which you can then shape into rings. (Moisten the ends      slightly with water to fasten them securely together.)    </p>    <p>      Now, in a deep pot, boil 3-1/2 quarts of water with 1      teaspoon of salt added. After the shaped rings have been      allowed to rise for about 15 minutes, drop them into the      water and boil them for 3 minutes, turning often.    </p>    <p>      Once that's accomplished, sprinkle (if you like) poppy      seeds, sesame kernels, or dried, chopped onions over the      bagels . . . and bake them on a well-greased cookie sheet      for 25 minutes-until the breads are a golden      brown-at 425 Â°F.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, we like to enjoy both of these hearty breads      spread with cream cheese, so-once the few precious,      store-bought packages of the dairy treat are gone-we      rely on a homemade variety that's very tasty.    </p>    <h3>A CREAM CHEESE SPREAD</h3>    <p>      I simply make yogurt from dry milk, and hang it (over a      bowl) in a cheesecloth bag for about 12 hours! The result      is tangier than the commercial spread, but equally      delicious . . . especially when served with blueberry and      other jams. (The whey that drips out of the suspended      yogurt is either used in soup or fed to our pack of sled      dogs, who consider it a very special treat!)    </p>    <p>      We find that eating a variety of breads livens up our menus      . . . and fresh-baked bagels and English muffins are, by      far, our favorite ways to partake of the "staff of life"!    </p>
