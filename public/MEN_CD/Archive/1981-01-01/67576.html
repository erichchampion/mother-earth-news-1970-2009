        <p>It's easy to forget that one of the best pieces of advice any handyperson can follow is, "Start simple!".</p><p id="byline">On many occasions I have succumbed-as most handymen and -women do at one time or another-to "tool fever" . . . a disease which causes the sufferer to believe that the solution to any workshop problem involves buying more complicated (and usually more <em>expensive)</em> equipment. However, a recent experience caused me to remember that most households already <em>have</em> any number of effective <em>(and</em> low-cost) "tools"!</p><p>In my early attempts to glue together the two pieces of wood shown in the accompanying photograph, I tried spring clamps, "C" clamps, and handscrews . . . all in the hope of holding the components together until the adhesive could dry.</p><p>Each of the standard "solutions" failed to work, though. The fasteners would either slide off the curved boards themselves . . . or cause the pieces to slip out of alignment.</p><p>Then I hit upon the answer. Believe it or not, the plain old heavy-duty rubber bands illustrated here provided enough pressure to assure a good joint, and they <em>didn't</em> slide free. I was able to attach the block of oak to the chair leg and finish a repair job that (since I was reshaping a missing section of the leg) required a very solid bond.</p>
