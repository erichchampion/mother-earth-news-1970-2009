                <p>      Luscious liquers-for cold-weather sipping or gourmet      cooking-are easy to make at home!    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Sandra L. Allen    </h5>        <p>      Amaretto, Kahlua, Strega, Drambuie, and other costly      imported liqueurs have enjoyed a tremendous popularity in      recent years. Folks have discovered that-aside from      their use in cocktails and as afterdinner drinks-such      elixirs can turn ordinary dishes into fine cuisine      <em>(and</em> that a dollop of one of the heady beverages      in a cup of hot coffee can guarantee a warm, comfortable      conclusion to a cold day of ice fishing or woodcutting or      cross-country skiing).    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, the budget-breaking connoisseur cordials are      quite simple-and comparatively inexpensive-to prepare      at home, because infusion (the steeping of ingredients in      an alcohol base) is the primary method employed in the art      of making liqueurs.    </p>    <p>      Such preparation doesn't require much in the way of special      technical know-how .. . <em>or</em> equipment: An aspiring      alchemist needs only measuring cups and spoons, a      good-sized saucepan, a funnel, some cheesecloth, and a      supply of empty bottles (wine, liquor, etc.) that can be      securely corked or sealed.    </p>    <h3>THE HONEY FACTOR</h3>    <p>      Homemade liqueurs are grouped into two basic types,      according to whether the sweetening ingredient is added      <em>before</em> or <em>after</em> the infusion period. Most      recipes call for sugar, but honey can be substituted in      many instances. In fact, the special "character" of some      liqueurs, such as Irish Mist and Drambuie, can be directly      traced to the distinctive flavor of the natural sweetener.    </p>    <p>      Clover honey is generally considered ideal for cordial      preparation, as its mild flavor won't overpower the other      ingredients. The major <em>disadvantage of</em> using honey      is that your finished product may have a somewhat cloudy      appearance. This can be corrected, however, by carefully      siphoning the liquid into a clean bottle after the sediment      has had time to settle to the bottom. (If you're interested      in "growin' your own" honey for your, homemade liqueurs,      check out the article beginning on page 78!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>COFFEE LIQUEUR</strong>    </p>    <p>      I began my cordial-making career with a recipe for a coffee      liqueur. When vodka is used as the base spirit, this drink      will turn out much like Mexican Kahlua . . . and if you      substitute dark rum for the vodka, it will taste more like      Jamaican Tia Maria. (Try serving the beverage over ice      cream for a great new twist on the conventional sundae!)    </p>    <p>      For either version, boil 1 cup of water in a saucepan . . .      gradually pour in 2 cups of sugar . . . and stir the      boiling mixture until the sweetener dissolves and the syrup      is clear. Add 2 ounces of instant espresso coffee powder      (or you could use 1 cup of <em>very</em> strong brewed      espresso-or other dark roast coffee-instead of      water as the liquid in the sugar syrup) and mix the      ingredients thoroughly. Remove the pan from the heat . . .      allow it to become cool to the touch ... and stir in 1 pint      of 80-proof vodka or rum.    </p>    <p>      Now, place 1/2 of a vanilla bean (found in the grocery's      spice section) in each of two bottles. Funnel in the      mixture and allow the brew to stand for three weeks in a      cool, dark cupboard. After the waiting period has elapsed,      shake each bottle to loosen any sediment, and strain the      liquid-through a funnel lined with      cheesecloth-into clean bottles that, again, contain      your recycled vanilla bean halves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GOLDEN HERBAL LIQUEUR</strong>    </p>    <p>      Legend has it that Italian Strega was first created by      three beautiful witches . . . and that lovers who share the      magical potion will never be parted.    </p>    <p>      Preparing a similar beverage involves sweetening the brew      <em>after</em> its rest period, and requires angelica root,      an herb that may prove difficult to find (though most      <em>well-stocked</em> health food stores should either      carry it themselves or be able to refer you to a source).    </p>    <p>      To make the spicy cordial, remove the seeds from 6 cardamom      pods . .. add 3 teaspoons of anise seed . . . and crush all      the kernels with the back of a fork. Put them in a 1-quart      container with 2-1/4 teaspoons of chopped angelica root, 1      three-inch-long cinnamon stick, 1 clove, 1/4 teaspoon of      mace, and 1 fifth of 80-proof vod ka. Shake the mixture      well and store it in a cupboard for one week. Then pour it      through a cheesecloth-lined strainer several times, and      blend the liquid with 1 cup of sugar syrup (see previous      recipe). The liqueur can be consumed immediately after      sweetening.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"ALMOND" LIQUEUR</strong>    </p>    <p>      This delicately almond-flavored cordial is a bit taxing to      prepare, because the required apricot or peach pits are      difficult to crush. I've found, however, that partially      filling a cloth bag (such as an old pillowcase) with pits      and then pounding them with a hammer gets the job done well      enough.    </p>    <p>      The rest is easy. Just place two cups of smashed pits (the      crushed shells seem to add as much flavor as do their meaty      centers, so use everything!) in a 1-quart container, and      add 1/2 teaspoon of ground cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of ground      coriander, and 2 cups of 100-proof vodka. Store the      infusion for two months in a cool, dark place... then      filter it through a cheesecloth-lined strainer and discard      the fruit pits. Sweeten the almond nectar with 1 cup of      sugar syrup, and store it until the liquid clears.    </p>    <h3>A FINAL NOTE</h3>    <p>      Though your homemade liqueurs will certainly be of      marketable <em>quality,</em> their sale would be in      violation of laws governing the disposal of alcoholic      beverages. (Neither should the drinks be labeled with their      "proprietary" names: Kahlua, Strega, or what have you.)    </p>    <p>      The laws, however, <em>don't</em> place restrictions on      "kitchen cordials" as gifts. In fact, the most pleasant use      I've found for my creations is to present them to my      friends (and foraging thrift stores and garage sales for      interesting containers has proved to be nearly as much fun      as making the cordials in the first place!).    </p>    <p>      What's more, I've mentioned just a very few of the infinite      possibilities for creating fine liqueurs. So, go on . . .      experiment! You have all the fruits and spices of the earth      from which to extract an unlimited variety of aromas,      flavors, and colors. Who knows, you may invent your own      legendary potion!    </p>
