    <p>
                <p>      One of Angus Macdonald's fondest dreams is to share enough      knowledge with his neighbors to enable them to design and      build <em>their own</em> energy-efficient homes.    </p>                                <p>      Through an unfortunate set of circumstances, many people      have come to assume that architects (and architecture) have      little to do with the construction of dwellings within      reach of the budgets of average families. Instead, we often      assume that such artists design spectacular and expensive      (but not necessarily <em>useful</em> ) structures such as      the St. Louis Arch . . . or-far less      happily-chrome buildings with exploding windows, and      column-supported skyscrapers promising to tip over in an      earthquake . . . and to produce wind-tunnel-effect      tornadoes at street level until they do!    </p>    <p>      That's a shame really! Because, as MOTHER was recently      reminded, architects-the ones with what we might call      "right minds"can be indispensable in helping others learn      to live more comfortably for less . . . in the sort of      energyefficient structures most readers of this magazine      would prefer.    </p>    <p>      Angus Wyman Macdonald is a Yale University Master Architect      who chose his path early in his schooling (he can't even      recall <em>when</em> he decided to become an architect! ).      The central emphasis of his studies was on low-cost,      energy-efficient construction . . . and his master's thesis      involved designing a low-income housing project in Harlem.    </p>    <p>      After graduation, Angus spent a few months with a large      architectural firm, and then-somewhat      disaffected-chose to leave the corporation and tackle      a lowcost housing project in Jamaica. There he researched      the potential of bagasse boards (made from a sugar cane      byproduct) as a building material, and worked side by side      with local people to construct prefab houses from the      recycled substance. Upon returning to his family's farm in      rural Virginia, the young designer spent time      reconstructing some innovative buildings that had been      erected by his architect grandfather almost 40 years      previously.    </p>    <h3>LIVING HIS WORK</h3>    <p>      If one considers Macdonald's background, it's not      surprising that the designer's <em>own</em> home-a      sod-roofed block building equipped with many of the      numerous alternative energy schemes he's worked      on-reflects a continuing experimentation with      materials and techniques . . . as well as its owner's      commitment to a set of essential principles.    </p>    <p>      The architect believes that there are perhaps three basic      aspects to good home design . . . all of which are, of      course, united under the rubrics of energy-efficiency and      simplicity. First of all, Angus states, a home should be      comfortable (bright, airy, spacious, and warm). Second, it      should be no larger and no more complicated than is      absolutely neces sary . . . both to reduce expense and to      maintain simple, environmentally harmonious forms that are      pleasing to the eye. And third, structures should demand as      little energy as possible (and the bare minimum of      nonrenewable resources), both in the course of their      construction and during their years of use. But the best      way to get a feel for Angus's theories is to take a look at      their, application to homes that he has designed in and      around his community.    </p>    <h3>THE BRESEE HOUSE</h3>    <p>      The first of the Macdonald earth shelters to be completed      was a surprisingly spacious, 820-square-foot, two-bedroom      home with a sodded roof. Suzanne and H. Pendleton Bresee      are the owners of the structure, and did the contracting      themselves . . . hoping to become educated in the ways of      construction.    </p>    <p>      Each of the house's three main rooms receives      <em>direct</em> sunlight through at least one south-facing      double-paned window, and the roof overhangs the openings      far enough to <em>block</em> direct sunlight in the summer.      In addition, provision has been made for adding a layer of      fiberglass glazing against the fins that extend at the end      of each window. During the winter, the area between the      double glass and the fiberglass panels acts as both a solar      collector during the day and an insulative air gap at      night.    </p>    <p>      The walls themselves are made of 8" concrete block,      reinforced with 1/2" rebar and concrete fill in alternate      cavities. The exterior of the earth-bermed masonry is      protected with a heavy coating of Thoroseal brand      waterproofing, and appropriate gravel-and-pipe drainage      paths are set against the base of all the walls.    </p>    <p>      The Bresees did go slightly over the $21,000 budget that      Mr. Macdonald had allowed for the construction . . . partly      because an underground stream was unearthed during the      excavation. (While the well on the property had to be sunk      300 feet, a Caterpillar operator ran into plenty of running      water, at a depth of <em>seven</em> feet, <em>on</em> the      construction site . . . and extensive grade work was      required to reroute the flow.) Still, the Bresees managed      to complete the building for about $25,000.    </p>    <h3>THE MCLAIN HOUSE</h3>    <p>      While the Bresee house was of a standard design, Ferrel      McLain's home reflects an interesting one-of-a-kind      approach. The building is sited at the very peak of a hill,      and is dug into the earth to the depth of the roof on the      east and west sides.    </p>    <p>      The south end of the structure is a production greenhouse      (Ferrel is in the nur sery business), and it is equipped      with a plenum system to move solar-heated air around the      home's interior. The view to the south is of wooded      hillsides and pastures, and directly to the north are the      Blue Ridge Mountains.    </p>    <p>      One of the most interesting structural aspects of the      building is that the stresses imposed by the earth fill are      directly opposed to each other. So the architect and Mr.      McLain decided to use reinforced concrete block walls, and      to brace them by positioning prefab steel joists in      between. With the 2-1/2" slab roof formed on corrugated      steel <em>above</em> the beams, this earth shelter's "top"      is far stronger than the 8" of earth fill demands.    </p>    <p>      Ferrel did some of the work on the structure      himself-including applying a <em>triple</em> layer of      Thoroseal on top of the thick foam insulation-and,      although he's on the verge of completing the construction      of the 1,800-square-foot building, he's still      <em>$2,000</em> <em>under budget . . .</em> at an      out-of-pocket expenditure of $18,000. That works out to a      square footage cost of $10, a truly remarkable figure for a      mostly contracted earth-sheltered home!    </p>    <h3>OTHER PROJECTS</h3>    <p>      The volunteer fire department in Rapidan has been in need      of a new building for quite some time. So, about a year      ago, a community group got together, and its members have      been donating time and materials to help with the      construction ever since. Macdonald offered his      architectural services, and-not      surprisingly-Rapidan now has the first      earth-sheltered firehouse we've heard about.    </p>    <p>      Toward the beginning of November 1980, Angus was busy      racing winter in an effort to get the walls up on      <em>another</em> earth-bermed, passive solar home near the      Bresee house. At the same time he was involved in a few      larger <em>out-of-state</em> projects . . . but, after his      years in the city and in Jamaica, the Virginia boy has      rekindled his love for his country community. He likes the      idea of being a local energy-efficient architect, one who      can operate with a low overhead and who has the ability to      tailor his services to the needs and finances of his      neighbors. He believes firmly that our land's energy      consumption patterns must change in the future, and that      the basis for making a comfortable conversion to a happier      and more efficient lifestyle is to be found <em>within</em>      the structure of the typical individual community.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: A catalog of Angus Macdonald's standard      designs-containing brief descriptions and drawings of      five structures-is available for $5.00 from Survival      Consultants, Dept.
