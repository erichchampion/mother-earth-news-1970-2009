        Have you heard about the 'National Uniformity for Food Act' yet? Ifpassed, this controversial bill will undermine approximately 200state food safety and food labeling laws, and prohibit state andlocal governments from setting food safety standards higher thanthose established by the federal government.<br /><br />Currently, states have chosen to set higher standards in numerousareas. For instance, local state governments maintain regulationsthat ensure food served in restaurants, schools and nursing homesis safe to eat. (The federal FDA has <i>no</i> requirements for thesafety of food served in such establishments.) According to Rep.Henry Waxman (D-Calif.), 'This bill would eliminate virtually everystate and local law that provides greater protection than ourfederal food laws.'<br /><br />Alaska labels all its genetically modified fish. New York and RhodeIsland limit toxic materials in food packaging. Illinois regulatesegg processing to reduce contamination. California has set amaximum for lead and alcohol content in candy, requires thelabeling of ingredients that are known to be carcinogens andprohibits the use of certain dietary supplements by high schoolathletes. Sixteen states assure that shellfish is not contaminated.Maine requires that food producers disclose the use of post-harvestpesticides. Numerous states regulate potentially harmful foodadditives. Maryland requires a label if 'fresh' food was previouslyfrozen, and Delaware requires one if carbonated beverages containartificial sweeteners.<br /><br />By enacting legislation that makes food laws all conform to onefederal model, all these progressive policies will be made<i>illegal</i>. Supporters of the bill include food giants such asHJ Heinz Co., Kraft Foods, Sara Lee Corp., Nestle USA and manysupermarket chains.<br /><br />This legislation has already passed the House (H.R. 4167), but it'snot too late to do something about it! The Senate Health,Education, Labor and Pensions Committee is considering the NationalUniformity for Food Act (S. 3128) this week.<br /><br /><ul><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>View a list of<a href="http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/shredding.pdf" target="_blank">food safetylaws</a> in your state that could be wiped out by the NationalUniformity for Food Act.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><br /></li><li>Encourage your<a href="http://www.congress.org/congressorg/directory/congdir.tt" target="_blank">senators</a>to safeguard our best food safety standards.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><br /></li><li>Take action via the<a href="http://ucsaction.org/campaign/03_15_06_food_labels" target="_blank">Unionof Concerned Scientists</a> or the<a href="http://ga3.org/campaign/fooduniformity_house_passage" target="_blank">Centerfor Food Safety</a>.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><br /></li><li>Read about the federal<a href="http://www.ucsusa.org/news/press_release/fda-scientists-pressured.html" target="_blank">FDA scientists</a> who were pressured to alter safetyfindings.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /><br /></li></ul>
