                  	        <p>      <strong>I</strong>n 1927, Buckminster Fuller, then 32, stood at the edge      of a freezing Lake Michigan and resolved to throw himself      into the water, thus ending a life he deemed "wasted." His      young daughter had recently died, leaving him, his wife and      remaining infant daughter in a world of grief and      desperation. A college dropout and by most accounts      thoroughly uncomfortable in his own skin, Fuller was unable      to keep hold of a steady idea, much less a job that      supplied even the basic necessities for his family. But as      he stood and pondered the end of his young life, he was      struck suddenly by the notion that the enemy crushing his      spiri t and informing his death was actually his own ego,      and that he would do better to commit "ego-cide" rather      than suicide. He chose at that moment to think and work on      behalf of all humanity, rejecting personal gain and      aggrandizement in the process. "An experiment to discover      what the little, penniless, unknown individual might be      able to do effectively on behalf of all humanity" saved him      from drowning and his family from renewed heartbreak.</p>			<p> Over the following</p><p> 50 years, the      "experiment" resulted in the following: 50 U.S. patents, 28      authored books, 47 honorary degrees in engineering and the      humanities, the Presidential Medal of Freedom (the highest      national honor that a private citizen can receive) and      dozens of other awards. From an architectural standpoint      alone, he may well be the greatest American thinker of the      20th century.    </p>    		<p>      Coining a term that is now part of science's vocabulary, he      found that a lack of "synergy," or interconnectedness, was      apparent in the social and architectural systems of the      day. Addressing the latter concern, he proposed a shelter      that enclosed more space with fewer materials than any      other. A dome composed of interlocking triangles would not      only have the virtue of accomplishing this, but would also      provide tremendous tensile strength and wind resistance. It      took a commission from the U.S. Pavilion at Montreal's      Expo'67 to convince the world of the aesthetic and      structural integrity of the geodesic principle. Fuller      describes the system himself:</p><p>      "Let me be blunt, contractors are building houses the way      they did 2,000 years ago. With traditional building, the      pillars become the essential weapon in the fight against      gravity. 'Dome-type' construction integrates the structure      into a continuous surface. Curves are always stronger than      planes. In conventional building the roof weighs so much,      interior walls are needed to support it. The attic becomes      a huge waste of space, material, and labor that you pay      for.</p><p>      "The triangle is the strongest structure known to man. You      build a sphere from triangles you have a super      structure."</p><p>      And he dreamed on. Taking advantage of the fact that warmer      air inside a dome provides lift, he proposed a gigantic      geodesic covering all of Manhattan island. A dome over      one-half mile in diameter would actually float with only a      1Â°F air temperature difference, so the structure would      not only not require a foundation, it would have to be      tethered to the ground.</p><p>      The U.S. Marine Corps hailed the geodesic dome as "the      first basic improvement in mobile military shelter in 2,600      years," and domes constructed of plastic and fiberglass      have been withstanding 200 mph winds in the Arctic for over      a decade.    </p>    		<p>		 <em>Buckminster Fuller's life      experiment ended in 1983, leaving a legacy of incalculable      inspiration in its wake.<br /></em></p><p> -Matt Scanlon    </p>
