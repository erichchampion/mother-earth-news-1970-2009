            		<p>			 <strong>COUNTRY VET</strong>		</p>      			<p>			<strong>Just when you thought it was safe to pet Old Yeller...</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">		By Jon Geller, D.V.M.		</h5>		<p>	       On a frosty December evening in 1997, a      Wyoming rancher went out to feed his horses and noticed      that his three-year-old paint gelding was down in tile      pasture, struggling to get up.</p><p> The rancher, who we will      call Bill Williams could see no signs of a broken leg or      any other injuries. He called his veterinarian, Dr. Larson,      who instructed Williams to attempt to trailer the horse to      the veterinary hospital. Williams finally got his horse up      with the help of his family and a few neighbors.</p><p> Rabies is      primarily a disease of wildlife. That is why we (and our      sundry critters) who live as far from pavement as possible      are at greatest risk. Raccoons, skunks, bats and foxes are      the animals most affected in the United States.</p><p> The paint      gelding was completely uncoordinated in his back legs and      swayed unsteadily as he was loaded into the trailer. By the      time the rancher arrived at the clinic, the horse was back      down and needed to be coaxed up and out of the trailer.</p><p> Dr.      Larson's examination showed no evidence of trauma, except      where the gelding had banged its head on the trailer when      it went down. In his case report, Larson described profound      neurological signs, most likely involving the spinal cord.      The horse would kick out and jerk reflexively when touched      on a back leg. Unable to stand, it would stagger and      finally go down in its stall.</p><p> Results of X rays of the      horse's neck area proved normal. The animal was sedated and      treated with intravenous fluids and anti-inflammatories.      Dr. Larson told Williams that the horse probably had either      injured, or had an infection in, its spinal cord or else      had ingested a toxin causing neurological damage. In any      event, response to treatment within 24 hours would likely      indicate the severity of the problem and the possibility of      recovery.</p><p> Rabies is an invariably fatal disease of the      nervous system. Transmitted by saliva, it is passed from      one victim to the next through either a bite wound or      contact with an open cut. The rabies virus slowly but      inexorably travels up nerve cells to the salivary glands      and the brain, where it wreaks its deadly havoc. It can      take days or months for the virus to reach the brain,      depending on the size of the animal and location of the      bite.</p><p> There are typically only one or two cases a year of      equine rabies in Wyoming, but Dr. Larson was alert enough      to keep it on his list of possibilities. Both he and      Williams spent the rest of that long night wondering how      the horse would be the next day.</p><p> The following morning, the      paint was much worse. Unable to stand, it lay helplessly in      its stall. The time had come to euthanize the horse.      Afterward, Larson faced the grisly task of severing the      paint's head, extracting the brain and submitting it for      rabies testing. Strangely, in these times of sophisticated      biotechnology, this is still the only method to confirm      rabies in animals.</p><p> Amy Boerger-Fields is a technician with      the Wyoming Department of Public Health. She routinely      analyzes samples of tissue and blood for signs of      infectious disease, especially ones that are highly      contagious in livestock or can spread to humans. To      diagnose rabies, she must look at a sample of brain tissue      that has been sectioned into paper-thin slices and treated      with a fluorescent antibody stain. If rabies is present,      the antibodies will bind to the virus multiplying in the      brain tissue and glow when viewed under a microscope.</p><p>      Boerger-Fields received the gelding's brain the next day,      protected in a Styrofoam cooler. After donning gloves and a      face shield, she prepared the slide and slipped it onto her      scope. She tweaked the fine focus knob, and her eyes      widened as the distinct glow of fluorescing antibodies      confirmed the diagnosis of rabies.</p><p> Phone lines zipped with      the news Within 24 hours, Williams, Dr. Larson and six      other people who had contact with the horse received a      series of rabies vaccinations and antibody injections.      Larson only needed a booster, as he had previously been      vaccinated for rabies, as had Amy Boerger-Fields.</p><p> The tale      of the paint gelding should serve as warning to all of us      who live in the country: rabies is out there. Thankfully,      so is the vaccine; so rest easy and read on.    </p>    		<h3>A Little Background		</h3>    <p>Rabies has been around forever hut      since the development of the vaccine by Louis Pasteur a      little over a century ago, incidences have been greatly      reduced. Extensive vaccination programs have largely      eliminated rabies in domesticated animals. Still, the      dreaded disease continues to simmer and occasionally boil      over in wild and domestic populations in much of the U.S.      and other parts of the world.</p><p> Although most common in wild      animals, the spillover into domestic animals can be      alarming. Cats, dogs, horses (and mules and donkeys),      cattle and sheep are all susceptible to rabies. If you live      in or travel to Mexico, don't pet the dogs. Last year      alone, 20 people died there as a result of rabid dog bites.</p><p>      If you want to live without rabies, go to an      island-Australia, Hawaii and Great Britain are all      rabies-free.		</p>		<h3>				Prevention is Easy			</h3>		<p>	      Prevention of rabies is straightforward: vaccinate. While a      large majority of all dogs and many cats are vaccinated,      livestock is often unprotected. If you live in an area      where rabies is present, vaccinate all of your valuable      livestock annually (see "Vaccination Guidelines," right).      Only one vaccine, Imrab 3 by Merial, is approved for use in      dogs, cats, sheep, cattle, horses and ferrets.</p><p> Vaccinate      all barn cats. Their inquisitiveness and cohabitation with      uninvited foxes, raccoons, skunks and bats has put them on      top of the list of domestic animals affected by rabies,      with 300 laboratory confirmed cases last year in the United      States. (The number of actual cases is probably much      higher.)</p><p> Keep in mind that without a vaccination      certificate from a veterinarian, you won't be able to      transport your animals across state lines. A certificate is      also needed to board or license small animals. Have your      veterinarian vaccinate them during the next visit.</p><p> It- you      decide to vaccinate your animals yourself, follow the      guidelines shown above. Don't worry-if you accidentally      inject yourself, you won't get rabies, but you won't be      protected, either.</p><p> A vaccine for humans is available but      not generally necessary, except for those who spend time on      a regular basis in close proximity to wild animals,      especially raccoons, skunks, foxes or coyotes.     </p>		<h3>VACCINATION GUIDELINES FOR RABIES</h3>    <p>      <strong>WHAT ANIMALS TO VCCINATE:</strong>    </p>    <p>      All valuable livestock in areas of known rabies. All cats,      dogs and ferrets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHEN TO VACCINATE:</strong>    </p>    <p>      At four months of age, then annually. Three-year vaccine      for dogs, and cats is approved for some regions of the      United States with low incidence of rabies in wild      populations.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT TO VACCINATE WITH:<br /></strong><br />      Imbrab 3, by Merial or other approved product.    </p>    <p>      Keep refrigerated, use before expiration.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO VACCINATE:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Give to ml as an intramuscular injection to horses, cattle      and sheep. Use an 18-gauge by 1 1/2" needle. Inject 1 ml      under the skin in dogs, cats and ferrets. Use a 22- or      23-gauge by 3/4" needle, or smaller.		</p>				<h3>Human Exposure			</h3>		<p>				Only four people in the United States      died of rabies last year, which makes it a negligible      health risk to humans. Though the family of one 32-year-old      man of Warren County, New Jersey, might not agree. His old      home was well ventilated, allowing an occasional bat to      find its way into the living room. His wife recounts that      in July 1997, he had captured several bats with his hand,      protected only by a cloth. There was no recollection of a      bite wound. On October 12, the man developed an aching      sensation in his right shoulder and neck. He was      hospitalized with symptoms including fever, agitation,      insomnia and inability to swallow. His condition      deteriorated despite heroic attempts to diagnose and treat      him, and he died on October 23. Biopsies and blood tests      confirmed rabies transmitted from the eastern pipistrelle      bat.</p><p>      If you enjoy attracting these flying insectivorous rodents      to your property excellent. Just don't invite them in for      dinner. Apply screening and mesh to all open eaves,      cupolas, attic or soffit vents to keep them out. Almost all      of the human deaths from rabies in the last ten years have      occurred through unknown contact with bats, probably while      the victims were sleeping. Don't forget to batproof your      outbuildings, as well.		</p>		<h3>If Someone Does Get Bitten		</h3>		<p> 		  If the bite is from a vaccinated pet,      immediately and thoroughly clean out the wound .and keep an      eye on the pet for ten days. If the bite is from an      unvaccinated pet, the animal must be confined under close      observation for ten days.</p><p> Any stray dog, cat or ferret that      bites a person should be euGhanized immediately, and the      head must be submitted to the local health department for      rabies examination.</p><p> Any wild animal that bites a person is      considered rabid unless proved otherwise. Attempts should      be made to trap and euthanize the animal for rabies      testing. Anyone bitten by a wild animal should, after      thoroughly cleansing the wound, visit a physician to      determine the need for antirabies treatment. This consists      of a series of intramuscular injections of both the rabies      vaccine (to stimulate antibody production) arid a serum      containing antibodies to rabies.    </p>		<h3>Wild Animals as Pets		</h3>    <p>      Don't do it. Raccoons, skunks, coyotes, foxes and, of      course, bats are significant rabies carriers. Oral vaccines      for these species are being used widely by state    </p>    <p>      and federal agencies to control rabies in the wild, but      these are not available for private use. Besides, it's      illegal to keep wild animals as pets in most states.    </p>    <p>      By the way, those of you who enjoy keeping wolf hybrids as      pees have no legal means to vaccinate them for rabies, as      they fall into the same category as wild animals. Vaccinate      them anyway, since the vaccine most likely is protective,      even if it does not provide "official" protection. (If you      do need a rabies certificate, you may want to list the      breed as malamute/husky cross)		</p>		<h3>Signs of Rabies in Animals		</h3>		<p> 		  A rabid dog may not always try to demolish      your car, as did Stephen King's "Cujo." Still, behavior      changes are the earliest signs of rabies. Dogs and cats may      become aggressive, act frenzied and hyper-stimulated if      they have the "furious" form of rabies, or may act      strangely sedate, unable to swallow and drooling in the      "dumb" form. In either form, death follows within five days      of behavior changes, which provides the rationale for the      seven- to ten-day quarantine when a dog or cat bites a      person. Any animal alive ten days after biting someone      could not have had the rabies virus in its saliva at the      time of the bite.</p><p> Cattle, when infected, usually have been      bitten by a rabid skunk or raccoon and will display strange      bellowing, knuckling in the hind limbs, difficulty      swallowing and excessive salivation. In South American      cattle, rabid vampire bats cause paralysis. Horses may show      the signs of uncoordination seen in the paint gelding or      may chew at the original bite, occasionally acting      aggressively.</p><p> If you're concerned about the possibility of      rabies, get your vet out as soon as possible. Isolate the      animal, wearing durable gloves during handling, and      minimize contact, especially with the animal's mouth and      saliva. Be proactive and get livestock, dogs and barn cats      vaccinated, especially if you live in an area of known      rabies. Bat-proof your house and outbuildings. Rural life      makes for a fine existence, but it has its own set of      worries. Make sure rabies is not one of them.</p><p> <em>Just when      you thought it was safe to pet Old Yeller...</em></p><p> By Jon      Geller.D.V.M.    </p>
