            		<p>				 <strong>BACK COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>		</p>	 					<p>		      <strong>Freedom from tiny freeloaders.</strong>		</p>		<h5 id="byline">by Tim Hensley    </h5>        <p>      <em><strong>â€¹</strong> An engorged tick dwarfs its      unfed neighbor.</em></p><p><strong>O</strong>ne of the best things about growing      up in the country is being able to go outside anytime you      want. One of the worst things is all the bugs you have to      put up with especially ticks. I remember as a boy how we'd      "look" ourselves for ticks after playing outside. Often,      we'd find one or two. Sometimes we'd be covered-on our      pants, down our shirts, in our ears. It was the kind of      thing that made you want to spit. And always there was the      fear you might get Rocky Mountain spotted fever.</p><p> The      experience raised a lot of questions for me: Where do ticks      come from? How can there he so many? (We found three in my      cousins ear once after collecting pop bottles from along      the road!) What should you do after a tick has latched on?      And how dangerous is Rock Mountain spotted fever. anyway?</p><p>      Before jumping into these ticklish queries, a little      background, taxonomically speaking, is in order. First,      there's, the animal kingdom that much is easy Then phylum:      for ticks it's Arthropoda which in layman's terms means      joint legged creature. Next is class: spiders, scorpions,      ticks and mites (all of which have eight legs and no      antennae) make up the Arachnida class. Ticks are then      singled out under the super family Ixodoidea and then      divided into two distinct subfamilies, Argasidae (soft      ticks) and Ixodidae (hard ticks) Distinctions within a      family are denoted by genus and species, with about 800      species described worldwide.</p><p> Both hard and soft ticks are      potential disease carriers, but hard ticks are the main      vectors in transmitting tick-borne diseases to man.</p><p> Where      do ticks come from? They come from eggs a one-time batch of      as many as 5,000 per female in hard-tick species. The      larvae that hatch out are called seed ticks. These are not      "worms." as the stage name might suggest, but miniature      versions of adult ticks. Seed ticks have only six legs and      are unable to reproduce. Their top priority is getting      their first meal.</p><p> For a deer tick-the primary carrier of      Lyme disease-this is not what you'd call an exercise in      fine dining. Deer ticks prefer back-alley eateries like the      Rat's Back or Mouse Far Lounge. The meals at these places      are enormous. Adult ticks can take on anywhere from 200 to      600 times their unfed body weight. But as it goes with      back-alley eateries, sanitation is sometimes a problem. And      so along with its meal, the lama may also ingest a spiral      shaped spirochete bacterium known as Borrelia burgdorferi,      the organism that causes Lyme disease.</p><p> After completing the      meal (and while .still hanging out at the Rat's Back), the      larva molts. forming an eight legged nymph. Then it's back      to the buffet for meal number two. When this engorgement is      complete, the nymph drops off the host and hides in leaf      litter to molt into an adult capable of      reproduction-capable, that is, after a third and final      feeding.</p><p> With this meal as its goal, the adult tick climbs      a blade of grass or a weed stem. Then. when it detects      movement, heat or the "smell" of CO2, it waves it,,      forelegs in the air, hoping to catch a ride with some      unsuspecting traveler in this case, usually a deer. Tick      and mite experts (acarologists) call this behavior      "questing."</p><p> It can take several months for a tick to make      contact with a suitable host. As one writer puts it. ticks      are "great exponents of the gentle an of waiting." Just      hog, many die in the process is not known. What we do know      is that adult ticks can live up to five years without      feeding. And little Honder: According to Cynthia Mills, a      doctor of veterinary science from Salem, Oregon, ticks are      able to "suck water from the air, and [they] bother to      breathe [only] four times a day." As one researcher puts      it. "Nothing's on but the pilot light."</p><p> That's one reason      why ticks are sometimes so plentiful. Other factors include      El Nino winters and, of course. the number of eggs the      females lay. And as for those times when you end up with      three ticks in one ear, as my cousin did? Its possible that      You've stumbled into a nest of recently hatched larvae. But      a more likely explanation comes from a team of Ohio State      University- scientists: ticks, it seems, are drawn to      roadsides by simple vehicle activity-the aforementioned      movement, heat and CO, from exhaust. A technical but good      paper on the subject is available on-line, under the      user-friendly heading 'Why Did the Tick Cross the Road?' at      www.biosci.ohio-state.edu/~acarolog/acar-hp.htm</p><p> So does all      of this mean that anyone taking a walk on a country road      may as well hang a sign around his neck, reading: "Tick      Bait?" No, but it does mean you should it go tromping in      ditches in the middle of summer, when ticks are most      active. Other ways to protect yourself are pretty much      common sense:    </p>    <p>      Keep the area around your home free of tall grass and      weeds.    </p>    <p>      Stay to the center of pathways when walking through places      you know to be tick-infested.    </p>    <p>      Wear light-colored clothing with long sleeves and tuck your      pants into your hoots.    </p>    <p>      Use a DEET-based repellent topically. DEET has come under      criticism recently, but no other topical treatment is more      effective.    </p>    <p>      Use a permethrin-based repellent on outer clothing.      Permethrin is a synthetic version of pyrethrum, a      chrysanthemum extract.    </p>    <p>      And don't forget to look over yourself and your kids every      few hours; tick-borne diseases are not passed to a host      immediately, so removal of a tick, even three hours after      the initial bite, greatly reduces the chance of disease      transmission.    </p>		<p><strong>Hey, It's a Dog Tick's Life</strong></p>        <p>      Not all ticks have the same life cycle. Some spend each      stage (larva, nymph and adult) on the same host. Others,      like the black-legged deer tick, follow a two-host,      two-year regimen. And still others, like the American dog      tick <em>(Dermacentor variabilisl,</em> move from host to      host with each life stage, living usually for three years      (see above). In each case, the fed adult ticks die after      reproducing.    </p>    <p>      <em>CHART ILLUSTRATION: KENNETH LIN</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Unloading a Freeloader</strong><br />      -----------------</p><p>      What is the best way to remove a tick? First off, forget      using petroleum jelly, alcohol, fingernail polish or the      ever popular hot match. These methods don t work and may      even cause a tick to defecate or regurgitate fluid back      into the host.</p><p> The tried-and-true method is manual      tick-picking. Ticks secrete a kind of cement that bonds      their mouth pairs to a host, so removal ran be a challenge.      But there are tools on the market that will enhance your      success. These devices are designed to get a firm grip on      the head of the tick so that it's not left behind.</p><p> If a      tick tool seems a bit much, then common tweezers and latex      gloves will work just fine. Take care not to squeeze the      tick's body with the tweezers, as this can inject      spirochete laden gut juices into the bite. And afterward,      be sure to wash your hands thoroughly.</p><p> Some folks save a      tick once it's been removed. This is not a bad idea. If you      or a pet has been infected, having the tick on hand (no pun      intended) will make it easier to test for a particular      disease. Keep the tick in an airtight vial or some similar      container. Putting a straight pin through the tick (as when      collecting insects) is a definite no-no; this can pierce      the gut region, which may contain dangerous pathogens.</p><p> How      dangerous? In some areas of the country Connecticut, Rhode      Island and New York State in particular-Lyme disease has      become a serious concern. Early diagnosis is the key to      treatment. Most people who are given antibiotics soon after      being infected recover rapidly and completely.      Unfortunately, however, cases of chronic Lyme disease are      not rare. The good news is that a vaccination has recently      been approved by the FDA and is now available by      prescription (see "New Vaccine May Lick Lyme Disease," page      20).</p><p> Though far less common than Lyme disease, Rocky      Mountain spotted fever is considerably more dangerous. Most      cases occur in the eastern United States, despite the      regional name. The American dog tick is the primary carrier      of the disease. Again, early diagnosis is key. Symptoms      include the sudden onset of fever, myalgia and severe      headache with or without the red-spotted rash. If treatment      occurs within five days of noticeable symptoms, the      mortality rate is 6.5%. After five days, it jumps to 22.9%.      Vaccinations are available.    </p>    <p>      So when you head outdoors this summer, enjoy yourself to      the top, but remember one thing: ticks the seas onto be      cautiousness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NEW VACCINE MAY</strong> <strong>LICK LYME      DISEASE</strong>    </p>    <p>      During the last two decades, Lyme disease has emerged as      the most common tickborne illness in the United States,      with nearly 100,000 cases reported to the Centers for      Disease Control since 1982.    </p>    <p>      A multistage bacterial infection, Lyme disease can produce      a range of ailments from skin rash to flu-like symptoms to      arthritis to cardiac irregularities. But even more      frightening are those instances in which the disease      remains asymptomatic-for months or even years following the      initial tick bite-only to manifest itself in its very late      stages in the form of severe arthritis or potentially      debilitating neurological problems.    </p>    <p>      And since the vector for this insidious disease is the      so-minuscule-it's-hard-to-spot deer tick, most folks will      never know they've been bitten unless or until symptoms      appear. That's why prevention is vital.    </p>    <p>      Enter LYMErix(TM), the first-ever vaccine for Lyme disease.      In extensive clinical trials, LYMErixITM) was shown to be      both safe and effective in preventing symptomatic and      asymptomatic forms of the disease in individuals age 15 to      70. Approved by the FDA last December, LYMErix is now      available by prescription.    </p>    <p>      The vaccine is recommended for folks who live, work or play      in high-incidence areas, including the Northeast, upper      Midwest and Pacific coastal regions. It carries a small      risk of injection-site reaction, including redness,      swelling and possibly joint or muscle pains.<br />      For more information about Lyme disease or the vaccine,      talk to your doctor, call the LYMErix toll-free hotline at      1-888-LYMErix ext. 500, or visit the Web at      www.lymerix.com/ .
