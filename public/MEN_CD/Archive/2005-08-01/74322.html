                		 <p><strong>      Native bees are essential to ensure a productive garden.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Barbara Pleasant    </h5>        <p>      You’ll harvest more and bigger fruits and vegetables      if you have enough pollinating bees visiting your garden.      In some cases, better pollination even means faster      maturity and better flavor.    </p>    <p>      Cornell University researchers have found that bee-assisted      pollination of strawberries can increase fruit size up to      40 percent. Other crops that depend upon native bees for      pollination include tomatoes, peppers, eggplants, pumpkins,      squash and melons, plus most berries and tree fruits. But      heavy reliance on pesticides, loss of habitat and      monoculture crop systems have decimated pollinator      populations.    </p>    <p>      “Monoculture makes it impossible for any bee -      native or otherwise - to keep year-round populations      sufficient for pollination,” says David Green, who      maintains the native bee Web site www.pollinator.com.      “A modern orchard has such a flush of bloom in spring      that the pollination task is overwhelming. The rest of the      year, it’s starvation or even a toxic      environment.”    </p>    <p>      Besides avoiding pesticides, you can support native bee      populations by protecting natural areas on your property,      leaving field and road borders unmowed to provide habitat      for ground-nesting bees, and planting or preserving stands      of native flowering plants (that the bees use for food) in      pastures and hedgerows. A diverse selection of flowering      plants and food crops ensures that pollinators have a      steady supply of nectar and pollen throughout the growing      season.    </p>    <p>      Take a close look at the flowers in your garden and you      will quickly see that honeybees, which are native to      Europe, have plenty of company, including numerous native      bee species with specialized talents. But while honeybees      are commonly protected by a beekeeper, native bees have no      human guardians. This is why it’s important to help      build native bee populations in your own area.    </p>        <p>      Like honeybees, native bees feed on nectar while gathering      pollen to take back to their nests as food for their young.      In the process, they pollinate flowers, often doing a      better job than honeybees on certain crops such as apples,      berries, alfalfa and almonds. Bumblebees are the preferred      pollinators for greenhouse-grown tomatoes, and pumpkin      growers from Wisconsin to Alabama are recognizing the value      of squash bees - short-lived native species that      often outnumber honeybees visiting squash blossoms, even      when honeybee hives are nearby. In areas where cool      temperatures limit honeybee activity during the spring      blooming of fruit trees, native mason bees do the job      because they are better adapted to cool weather.    </p>    <p>      Pollination in some crops is a collective effort among      different species, however. Researchers at Ohio State      University found that 18 species of native bees were doing      most of the pollinating work in nearby strawberry fields.    </p>    <p>      These native bees don’t produce honey, and they      can’t be reared in managed hives. But when they are      given even small patches of suitable habitat, such as a      fence row or diverse garden, some of the 4,000-plus species      of native bees will show up.    </p>    <p>      “In a 20-acre woodland park that includes trees and      flowers and that hasn’t been sprayed with pesticides,      there may be 100 species of native bees present on a summer      day,” says Jim Cane, research entomologist at the      U.S.epartment of Agriculture’s Bee Biology Lab in      Logan, Utah.    </p>    <p>      According to the National Sustainable Agriculture      Information Service, the following native bees are      particularly good pollinators of certain crops, although      they pollinate other flowering plants, as well:    </p>    <p>      <em>• Alkali bees: onions, clover, mint and      celery<br />      • Bumblebees: blueberries, tomatoes, eggplants,      peppers, melons, raspberries, blackberries, strawberries      and cranberries<br />      • Carpenter bees: passionfruit, blackberries, canola,      corn, peppers and beans<br />      • Leafcutter bees: legumes, especially alfalfa, and      carrots<br />      • Mason bees: almonds, apples, cherries, pears, plums      and blueberries<br />      • Shaggy fuzzyfoot bees: blueberries and apples<br />      • Squash bees: squash, gourds and pumpkins</em>    </p>    <p>      It’s also important to understand that male bees      can’t sting (a bee stinger is a modified egg-laying      organ), and females won’t sting unless they are      provoked. “They have no honey to protect, so they are      not built to defend themselves from mammalian      predators,” Cane says. If you find that you like      sharing the company of native bees, or you want to enlist      their help to pollinate your plants, some species will      accept human invitations in the form of nesting boxes.    </p>    <h3>      Wild Bee Lifestyles    </h3>        <p>      Big, fuzzy, black-and-yellow bumblebees and a few types of      small sweat bees are the only native bees that live in      colonies. Most other species live alone and associate with      others only long enough to mate. Mason bees, carpenter bees      and leafcutter bees are called cavity nesters because they      make their nests in the holes of trees, fence posts,      firewood, hollow plant stems or handmade bee nesting      blocks. More numerous ground-dwelling bees dig tubular      burrows no larger than a drinking straw. Bumblebees often      make their home in underground burrows vacated by rodents.    </p>    <p>      Like honeybees, bumblebees are general feeders that visit a      broad range of host plants. But many wild bees have      restrictive tastes and stick close to the plants they were      born to serve. Squash bees, for example, followed early      strains of squash as native people moved the crop northward      from Central America. Females emerge in early summer and      only fly in the morning when squash blossoms are open. In      the afternoon, you often can find males curled up asleep in      closed squash flowers (yes, bees do sleep). Cane recently      worked with the specialist bee that pollinates only      rabbiteye blueberries - and that does so with amazing      efficiency. The adult life of a specialist bee is quite      short, but in only a few weeks, just one of them often      out-pollinates 100 honeybees.    </p>    <p>      Because specialist bees need pollen from specific plants,      they tend to stay close to home and forage in smaller      plantings, says James Tew of Ohio State University’s      Honey Bee Lab. Most native bees pose no problem for plants,      though leafcutter bees do harvest rounded leaf pieces from      roses, ash trees and several other plants, which they use      to build their nests. “The small amount of leaf      material taken is a bargain when the pollination activities      of leafcutter bees are considered,” Tew says.    </p>    <p>      Various species of leafcutter bee have been found to be      much better pollinators of alfalfa, blueberries, carrots,      sunflowers and onions than honeybees. For example, in an      enclosed greenhouse where carrots were being grown for      seed, researchers found that 150 leafcutter bees could do      the work of 3,000 honeybees. One non-native species, the      alfalfa leafcutter bee, is now reared by the millions      because it does such an outstanding job pollinating alfalfa      grown for seed.    </p>    <h3>      The Native Edge    </h3>        <p>      Particular characteristics contribute to native bees’      pollination talents. Many native bees are quite hairy, and      tufts of hair (such as those on the abdomens of female      leafcutter bees) serve as soft brushes that gently transfer      pollen from a flower’s stamens to its stigma (the      female part that connects to the ovary). The buzz factor      also is important because some flowers, such as blueberries      and most members of the tomato family, need to be vibrated      to shake the pollen loose from the stamens. Scientists call      this process “sonication,” but Arizona      entomologist Stephen Buchmann (co-author of The Forgotten      Pollinators) came up with another phrase: “buzz      pollination.” Bumblebees, digger bees and several      other native bees are great buzz pollinators.    </p>    <p>      The diversity of native bees matches the diversity of      native plants. With the help of his camera, David Gordon, a      professor of zoology at Pittsburg State University in      Kansas, has seen that some native bees have long tongues,      so they can lap nectar from tubular flowers while others      have shorter tongues more suited to flat blossoms. Native      bees also vary in size from half-inch iridescent sweat bees      to 1½-inch carpenter bees. Tiny bees can access the      littlest flowers for pollination purposes while bigger bees      buzz blossoms, tramping pollen from place to place with      their feet, and sometimes accidentally improving      pollination by chasing honeybees across the faces of      sunflowers and other big-blossomed plants.    </p>    <h3>      Enhancing Habitat    </h3>    <p>      Native bees seldom travel more than a quarter mile from      their nests, so improving bee habitat can have a very      direct benefit in your garden. The Xerces Society, a      nonprofit insect preservation group based in Portland,      Ore., suggests several simple ways to make your property      more hospitable to native bees:    </p>    <p>      <em>• Minimize the use of pesticides and avoid      spraying botanical or biological insecticides in the      morning, when native bees are most active.<br />      • Grow a diverse selection of flowering plants      (including as many native species as possible).<br />      • Grow crops such as squash, sunflowers, blueberries      and strawberries every year to maintain resident      populations of the specialist bees that serve them.<br />      • Leave some areas uncultivated so you don’t      disturb bees that nest in the ground.</em>    </p>    <p>      The same plants that attract butterflies and beneficial      insects often attract native bees; both insect groups are      most numerous where plants bloom over a long season. For      example, early spring-blooming willows and redbuds can be      followed by fruit trees, brambles and red clover before      your summer vegetables and flowers take over as primary      host plants. Then keep the pollen flowing into fall by      growing late-blooming asters and allowing goldenrod to      flourish along fence rows.    </p>    <p>      With a solid food supply nailed down, you can further      encourage native bees by providing attractive nesting      sites. For ground-nesting bees, a patch of uncultivated,      well-drained soil that gets morning sun will work well as      long as you avoid disturbing it with vehicles and tractors.      You also can make a sand pile or sand pit - or simply      fill a planter with sand and place it on a warm,      south-facing slope. If you see bumblebees buzzing around      the roots of a tree, leave them alone. They probably have      established a colony in a burrow vacated by mice or voles.    </p>    <p>      Beyond the benefits of improved crop pollination, good food      and habitat for native bees has a ripple effect in the      natural world. Native bees pollinate forest trees and      wildflowers, which in turn provide food for wildlife. Cane      says that because wild bees are vegetarians, they will      never ruin your barbeque by buzzing around your burgers.      “Sit down and enjoy the bees,” he suggests.      “They are great fun to watch.”    </p>    <p>      Barbara Pleasant is a veteran <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      contributing editor and award-winning book author. She      lives in the mountains of western North Carolina.    </p>    <h3>      Making Homes for Wild Bees    </h3>    <p>      Solitary cavity-nesting species such as mason bees are      attracted to logs and dead trees, as well as hollow      branches such as bamboo or sumac. Elderberry stems also are      good because they have a soft pith that’s easily      cleaned out.avid Green of www.pollinator.com says      don’t place elderberry stems out too late in spring      because they also are susceptible to potter’s or      mason wasps - although those are beneficial natives,      too. Wild bees also will make their home in a suitable      handmade dwelling, in a dead tree trunk, block of wood or      bundle of tubes. Here are three easy-to-make bee homes:    </p>    <p>      Bundled Sticks    </p>    <p>      Bundle together a dozen or so 10-inch-long pieces of      half-inch-diameter bamboo or sumac that have been hollowed      out at one end with a drill or awl. Stuff the bundle into a      coffee can or piece of PVC pipe, and then wire it securely      onto a tree branch or fence post.    </p>    <h3>      A Nesting Block    </h3>    <p>      Start with an 8-inch-long piece of untreated 4-by-6 or      6-by-6 wood post, or use a short log.rill      three-eighths-inch holes, 6 to 7 inches deep and at least 1      inch apart. Blacken the front of the block by placing it in      a fire for a minute or two. Attach the block to a post or      tree branch.    </p>    <h3>      A Bee Stump    </h3>    <p>      Drill into a tall existing tree stump, making 6-inch-deep,      three-eighths-inch holes that are spaced 2 inches apart on      the south and east sides of the stump.    </p>    <h3>      General Tips    </h3>    <p>      A secure entrance is crucial, so holes about three-eighths      inch in diameter are best. The tube-shaped holes also      should be at least 6 inches deep, so you will need an      extension bit for your drill. Several species can control      the gender of their offspring, and they like to place      female eggs deep in their burrows, with male eggs closer to      the entrance. That way, males will be waiting when the      females emerge. The holes should be closed at one end to      ensure the safety of the eggs, too.    </p>    <p>      Early spring is the best time to put out new bee nesting      blocks, because that’s when females are seeking new      homes. Locate the nests at least 3 feet off the ground in a      place where they will get warm morning sun and attach them      securely so they won’t shake in the wind. Make the      holes slope slightly upward so rainwater does not run into      the holes. As summer progresses, you will know you have      tenants if the holes or tubes become plugged with mud or      debris.    </p>    <h3>      Good Management of Carpenter Bees    </h3>    <p>      If you spot a large bee buzzing around your home that looks      like a shiny bumblebee without its fuzz, it’s      probably a carpenter bee. These are some of the largest bee      species and have a blue-black, green or purple metallic      sheen. Male carpenter bees can be curious and fly close to      humans, but they are completely harmless because they have      no stingers. Females can sting, but they rarely do.      Carpenter bees help pollinate numerous crops such as corn,      pole beans, peppers and blackberries.    </p>    <p>      Carpenter bees (Xylocopa species) may want to share your      home sooner or later if you have a wood house or a wood      deck. Females bore half-inch-wide holes into wood and then      excavate a burrow to raise their young, often reusing old      nests year after year. They will burrow into dry wood      wherever they can find it, but they prefer softwoods such      as pine. The damage they do to the wood, however, is mostly      cosmetic.    </p>    <p>      Extension entomologists unanimously agree that the best way      to prevent carpenter bee damage is to keep wood surfaces      painted (stains don’t deter them nearly as well as      paint). Some people have good luck plugging bee entry holes      with aluminum window screening held in place with duct      tape. After a few weeks, remove the duct tape and fill the      hole with wood putty.    </p>    <p>      “Carpenter bees are very selective of their nesting      wood,” says James Tew of Ohio State      University’s Honey Bee Lab. “If only a few      boards are being targeted and the plugging trick      doesn’t work, consider replacing those boards and      hope that the new ones are not as attractive.” But      because carpenter bees are beneficial, make sure they have      wood available that they can use. That way, both you and      the bees are happy.    </p>    <h3>      Pollinator Bee Resources    </h3>    <p>      <em>The Xerces Society<br />      (503) 232-6639<br />      <a href="http://www.xerces.org" target="_blank">www.xerces.org</a><br />      Xerces offers fact sheets on pollinator conservation and      also sponsors programs to safeguard the diversity of native      insects.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The University of Georgia’s<br />      Honey Bee Program<br /></em> <em>Has excellent guidelines      for creating a permanent pasture as habitat for native bees      at www.ent.uga.edu/bees/pollination/pollination.htm.
