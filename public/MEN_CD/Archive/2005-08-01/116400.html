        <p>In March, the city council in Berkeley, Calif., passed a resolution establishing a goal of zero waste - among the first in the country. The resolution calls for a 75 percent reduction in city waste by 2010, and zero waste by 2020.</p><p>Now the city’s <a title="Zero Waste Commission" href="http://www.ci.berkeley.ca.us/commissions/solidwaste/default.htm" target="_blank">Zero Waste Commission</a> is looking for ways to further enable recycling and put a stop to discarding residential food waste, construction and demolition debris, says Tom Farrell, manager of recycling and solid waste for Berkeley. California already has a 50 percent waste-reduction goal in place, and Alameda County strives toward a goal of 75 percent.</p><p>“We were already on a track and we were already moving, so now the track just got longer,” says Farrell, who anticipates that the changes could increase the budget by 10 percent to 15 percent.</p><p>Berkeley is not alone in such efforts. Seattle adopted its own zero-waste goal in 1998, and San Francisco and Carrboro, N.C., have passed similar legislation. Australia’s capital, Canberra, has a zero-waste goal for 2010, and New Zealand was the first country to implement a national strategy for achieving zero waste. Many nongovernmental initiatives, in places as diverse as Namibia, Colombia, Scotland and Sweden, also promote zero-waste policies.</p><p>“Zero waste is adopted as a philosophy and direction,” Farrell says. “There are programs available that are already being done elsewhere, so we’re not going to have to invent an entirely new program.”</p><p>Zero waste is based on the idea that “as in nature, a fully sustainable human culture will have no waste,” according to the <a title="Zero Waste International Alliance" href="http://www.zwia.org/" target="_blank">Zero Waste International Alliance</a>. It calls not only for recycling, reducing, reusing and repairing, but also for changes such as cleaner production, packaging and “voluntary simplicity.”</p>
