                    <hr />		<p>    CARTER'S ENERGY PLAN IS HURTING SOLAR BUSINESSES    .The President's proposal that tax credits be given    to people who use solar energy systems has backfired. Many    people now plan to wait until Congress acts on the measure to    buy their solar equipment, and, as a result of this    "hesitation" in the market, nearly 30% of all American solar    energy firms have gone out of business since the Presidential    plan was announced last April.<br />    <br />    POWERED BY POT? The Eugene, Oregon Water and    Electric Board recently burned nearly six tons of "high    grade" marijuana in its downtown generating plant. Oregon    utility officials aren't yet ready to commit themselves to    confiscated grass as a fuel source, though. "Despite this    material's excellent burning qualities," says one spokesman,    "it is doubtful that federal drug enforcement can meet our    needs."<br />    <br />    IT'S OIL THE SAME TO THEM . The    International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry sponsored a    gathering of 750 scientists and engineers in Toronto,    recently. All of this brainpower was assembled to discuss    potential chemical substitutes for fossil petroleum. Although    the meeting covered such possibilities as diesel fuel    distilled from coconuts and the direct hydrogenation of    poplar wood, no one solution met with unanimous group    approval. The assembled "experts" did agree, however, that    the chemical industry need not perish with the world's oil    supply.<br />    <br />    INDEPENDENT ENERGY SYSTEMS, INC . is a firm    that sells direct-drive, slow-speed, wind-driven electrical    systems and components from their own modern solar- and    wood-heated, wind-powered factory. The company can completely    convert your home or farm to wind power . . . handling    everything from site evaluation to delivery. Get in touch    with the folks at IES by writing them at 6043 Sterrettania    Road (Rt. 832), Fairview, Pennsylvania 16415. Be sure to    enclose $1.00 and a self-addressed, stamped envelope when you    request information.<br />    <br />    RAW SEWAGE IS A GAS , or will be, anyway,    once Western States Explorations, Inc. completes the methane    production plant that the firm is constructing in the    Baltimore area. The installation should be able to process    50,000 pounds of raw sewage a month . . . into 1 million    cubic feet of methane.<br />    <br />    SOLAR AND WOOD HEAT FOR POULTRY GROWOUT    HOUSES may soon be available. Georgia Tech engineers    have developed prototypes of the two systems as part of a    research program funded by the Georgia Department of    Agriculture. Both the wood-burning and solar-powered systems    are being tested at private poultry farms in the Atlanta    area.<br />    <br />    THE WORLD'S ONLY WIND-POWERED RADIO STATION    operates out of Oak Creek, Colorado. The station, KFMU, gets    its energy from a Jacobs Model 2700 32-volt generator built    in Minneapolis in 1947 . . . and tries to apply the "natural"    approach to its programming as well. KFMU uses no "canned"    music or announcer tapes, and limits advertising to one    two-minute period for every half hour of music that is    broadcast.<br />    <br />    LOW-LEVEL MICROWAVES MAY BE DANGEROUS ,    according to animal studies now being conducted by the    Environmental Protection Agency. Early results from these    tests indicate that microwaves may affect the immune system,    cause hernias of the brain, and produce a trend toward    lowered performance . . . heavy prices to pay for a 30second    hot dog.<br />    <br />    THE EARLY 70'S ENERGY CRISIS WEREN'T NOTHIN    ', says Daniel Yergin of the Harvard University    Business School. Yergin predicts that-if present fuel    consumption trends continue-energy prices will double or    triple by 1985 or '86, causing the national standard of    living to nosedive.<br />    <br />    SOME "LOST" NUCLEAR WASTE has become a    headache for the L.B. Foster Company in Washington, West    Virginia. The firm recently completed construction of a    $2-million facility, only to find that the land around it is    contaminated by a highly flammable mixture of radioactive and    chemical wastes. "The ground pops and sparkles if you rub the    soil," says plant manager Walter Pavlo. At present the    Nuclear Regulatory Commission is trying to figure out how the    dangerous material got there.</p>    <p>      A group of Nebraska farmers have formed FATLE (FARMERS      AGAINST TRANSMISSION LINE EASEMENTS) to control the      proliferation of high-voltage powerlines . . . . The      Northern Cheyenne Indians have successfully BLOCKED      CONSTRUCTION OF TWO 760-Mw COAL-FIRED PLANTS at Colestrip,      Montana . . . . Dartmouth College is planningwith the aid      of several other organizations- CONSTRUCTION OF A 50-Mw      BIOMASS-BURNING POWER PLANT to serve northern New England .      . . . For the past two winters, Pennsylvania State      University's 100-CUBIC-METER METHANE DIGESTER has processed      the manure from a 50-cow barn to produce 26.6 kwh worth of      methane a day . . . . A study done by citizens' groups in      Washington, D.C. shows that "NUCLEAR" UTILITIES GENERALLY      RECEIVE LARGER RATE INCREASES than conventional power      companies . . . . PASSIVE SOLAR RETROFIT OPPORTUNITIES are      described in "Passive Solar Retrofit for Homeowners",      available for 85d from Citizens' Energy Project, 1413 K      Street, N.W., 8th Floor, Washington, D.C. 20005.    </p>    <hr />
