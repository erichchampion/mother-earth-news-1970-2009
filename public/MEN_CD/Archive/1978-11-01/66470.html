                <p>      Filipino science writer Mario P. Chanco has news of a      fast-growing"wonder tree" . . . which produces livestock      feed, fertilizer, and large amounts of high-quality fuel      wood. LEPILI: THE "TREE OF LIFE"    </p>            <p>      Three decades of careless lumbering have done extensive      damage to the forests of the Philippine Islands. But public      concern over the loss of this valuable resource, coupled      with a recently introduced species of tree, now promises to      go a long way toward restoring the scarred island      hillsides.    </p>    <p>      The giant Lepili tree (Leucaena leucocephala) was brought      to the Philippines from Hawaii less than 10 years ago.      And-though local farmers have used the leaves and wood of a      smaller variety of the tree (known as the "ipil ipil") for      as long as they can remember-the new import has proved to      be a very pleasant surprise.    </p>    <p>      It seems, you see, that the Lepili (which was supposedly      cultivated by the Incas, Mayans, and Aztecs) is an      exceptionally versatile plant. Its leaves can be used as a      nitrogen-rich mulch which-it is reported-will stimulate      corn into producing yields four or five times greater than      those possible from unfertilized fields. The abundant      Lepili foliage has a high enough protein content to make it      a valuable livestock food,too.    </p>    <p>      But it's in the production of lumber, carving wood, and      (perhaps most important of all) fuel that the Lepili really      shines. Whereas most hardwoods grow relatively slowly, this      Hawaiian giant puts on height and girth with a vengeance.      Board lumber 8" wide, for example, can be cut from a      six-year-old Lepili : . . and the trees reach a height of      19 feet in only three years!    </p>    <p>      J. Antonio Leviste-the ecology-conscious governor of      Batangas province-is the man behind the Philippine      Lepili program. Leviste was quick to realize what the tree      could mean to his land and its people. He has, in effect,      turned Batangas into a huge Lepili nursery by sparking a      program that involves 30 million Filipino planters. The      goal of this grass-roots reforestation plan is to plant 1      billion, 800 million new trees by 1982!    </p>    <p>      This restoration effort-if it even approaches its      objective-will set an example for the rest of the      world. And, since the Lepili yields between 200 and 300      cubic feet of wood per hectare (2.471 acres), those newly      planted forests will provide the islands with a valuable      stockpile of inexpensive (and renewable) fuel.    </p>
