        <p>Sheltered by the magnificent Colorado National Monument to the west and the Grand Mesa to the east, Grand Junction is a charming town in a dramatic setting. Located in the 30-mile long Grand Valley, it is the major population center in an agricultural valley famous for its orchards. In recent years, wineries have become common in the valley, and the area is now regarded as one of the best winegrowing spots in the West.</p><p>As Grand Junction is surrounded by national monuments and forests, those who love the outdoors will find plenty to do: hiking, camping, rock climbing, fishing, horseback riding, rafting and mountain biking.</p><p><strong><em>Do you live in Grand Junction?
