        HARMAN HOME HEATING
        <br />
        <p>Harman Home Heating offers a “bottom feed” system that allows homeowners to use cheaper fuel, which also has higher ash content. Ashes are pushed out of the burn pot as new fuel is fed in. Regular maintenance (burn pot scraping) can be performed without shutting down the stove — a plus for both time savings and heating efficiency.</p>
