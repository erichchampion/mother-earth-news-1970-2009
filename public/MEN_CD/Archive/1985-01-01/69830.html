                    <p>      <em>You've insulated and caulked, but your house still      feels cold and drafty. You need to find...</em>    </p>    <hr />                <h5 id="byline">     by Emilie Barton    </h5>    <p>      When the temperature dropped and heating costs      jumped-two signs of fall-you decided to improve      the thermal performance of your home. So to button up your      house, you headed down to the hardware store to buy some of      those do-it-yourself weatherization kits that you'd seen      advertised so widely. You picked up storm windows, rolls of      weather stripping, and tubes of caulk to seal cracks around      doors and windows.    </p>    <p>      Yet, although you then spent an entire weekend on your      weatherization project, winter has shown you that your      house is still fairly drafty. There must, you reason, be      other places that are letting the north wind blow in.    </p>    <h3>      FINDING THE OTHER LEAKS    </h3>    <p>      According to Carl Ellerbrook, an "energy doctor," 80 to 90%      of the air leaks (called infiltration) in most houses come      from holes that people don't even know about. The average      dwelling has ten or so leakage areas, which may account for      as much as 40% of the home's total heating and cooling      requirements, and those window and door kits you installed      only took care of <em>two</em> of them. To really snuggle      up for the winter, you've got to find the rest of the gaps      in your dwelling's shell.    </p>    <p>      Ellerbrook's business-through his company, the Sunup      Energy Group Ltd. of Old Snowmass, Colorado-is      finding and sealing the other leaks. To do so, he performs      energy audits using a sophisticated device called a      <em>blower door</em> . This huge fan fits into an exterior      doorway and pressurizes a building to increase the leakage      rate. Then Carl uses a smoke pencil to trace drafts to      their sources. With the blower door and smoke pencil, he      can pinpoint even small leaks.    </p>    <p>      "Because every house is different," states Carl, "it's nice      to use a blower door and smoke pencil to take the guesswork      out of finding leaks." Still, after several years of      experience with that equipment, Carl has learned where most      of the typical problem areas are in the average home. So      although a competent energy audit is the best way to find      the thermal leaks in your home, checking out Carl's list of      the ten worst offenders will go a long way toward keeping      you cozy when the snow flies.    </p>    <p>      "You'll find air infiltration anywhere there's penetration      through the inside or outside shells of a building," says      Ellerbrook. Make a complete walk-through inspection of your      house, examining the following areas with particular care.      Then seal each leak from the <em>inside</em> of the house.      Weatherization materials will last much longer indoors,      where they're protected from harsh weather, and moisture      problems within the wall will be avoided.    </p>    <h3>      BOTTOM PLATES    </h3>        <p>      "If you don't do anything else," says Carl, "seal all gaps      between the subfloor and the bottom plate." In new      construction, this can be done by caulking the bottom      plates (the bottom, horizontal boards in walls) as they're      installed. In existing buildings, however, you'll have to      seal between the baseboards and the bottom plates.    </p>    <p>      A polyurethane foam sealant applied to the cracks will fill      any gaps and stop infiltration. This material is      particularly useful for leaks that are large (1/4" to 2"      wide), because it will expand to fill the cavity. When you      use the material, however, be sure to pull carpet back and      move furniture out of the way to avoid spills. It's also a      good idea to practice a little before you attempt your      first touchy sealing job.    </p>    <h3>      ELECTRIC OUTLETS AND SWITCHES    </h3>        <p>      Remove the cover plates from all switches and outlets and      install foam gaskets. These should be readily available at      hardware stores. To get a really tight seal, you can add      plastic socket plugs to unused receptacles.    </p>    <p>      Outlet and switch covers can actually account for up to 20%      of your home's air leaks, and the gaskets cost only about      $1.35 for a package of six. This is one of the least      expensive, easiest sealing jobs you can tackle.    </p>        <h3>      BEAM POCKETS AND JUNCTIONS OF DISSIMILAR MATERIALS    </h3>    <p>      Since heat rises, you could be losing a lot of energy      through cracks in the ceiling. Caulk thoroughly around the      edges of beams and anywhere two different materials meet.      Because the dissimilar materials shrink and expand at      different rates, cracks are fairly common.    </p>    <p>      As long as the gaps aren't too large, caulk is the best      sealant for visible parts of the ceiling. It can be      smoothed to make the patch job barely discernible.      Ellerbrook recommends Geocel's elastomeric copolymer caulk      because it's extremely flexible, but adds that any      siliconized acrylic latex caulk with a 15-to 25-year      warranty will work acceptably. A quality caulk will cost      about $6.00 per tube.    </p>    <h3>      VANITIES AND SINKS    </h3>        <p>      The holes that are drilled under kitchen and bathroom sinks      for plumbing runs are often oversized to allow for a little      error in layout. The offending gaps are then covered with      flanges and, unfortunately, are seldom sealed. Lift the      flanges on all pipes that pass through the walls or floor      of your home, and seal them with foam.    </p>    <h3>      DOORS    </h3>        <p>      Gaps between a door and its frame should be sealed with      weather stripping, but the frame itself should be caulked      to prevent leakage around the outside of the door jambs. To      seal the bottoms of doors, use weather-stripping tape and      vinyl door sweeps on all sills. If you have metal doors,      it's a good idea to pick a product that uses magnetic      weather stripping to provide a tight seal.    </p>    <p>      Con-Serv, Incorporated makes a garage door insulating cover      that attaches to the inside and adds R-5. The vinyl-faced      fiberglass also helps seal a leaky door. Expect to pay      about $65 for one of these kits.    </p>    <h3>      WINDOWS    </h3>        <p>      There are a great many products available for sealing      windows, but the most practical retrofit is to apply heavy      plastic and seal it to the window frame with polyethylene      tape. An equally easy, but slightly less effective,      approach is to use caulking cord, for which you can expect      to pay about $3.00 per roll.    </p>    <p>      You can also buy kits for sealing windows. The Bede system,      for example, includes a plastic sheet that attaches to      vinyl channels. When the material is heated with a hair      dryer, it draws up "drum tight" for a crystal clear      appearance. This treatment costs about 60 cents per square      foot.    </p>    <p>      While you're working on your windows, you should also      consider using insulated shades or shutters. Not only will      these increase the R-value of the glazed area, but they'll      help seal as well.    </p>    <h3>      AIR CONDITIONERS AND ATTIC FANS    </h3>        <p>      Fans and air conditioners should be covered with plastic      and sealed with tape or caulk when they're not in use.      Con-Serv makes an indoor air-conditioner cover that seals,      insulates, and reflects heat. Another option is to remove      the unit from the window for the winter and store it in a      sheltered location.    </p>    <h3>      FIREPLACES    </h3>        <p>      Caulk around the fireplace mantel and sides, using foam      backer rod to fill cracks that are too big for caulking      alone. Stone fireplaces to which drywall abuts are      particularly troublesome. Also, check the fireplace damper      to see that it closes tightly and seals well. (Since you'll      be using the fireplace during the winter, the only good      remedy for a leaky damper is to replace it.)    </p>    <h3>      WIRING PENETRATIONS    </h3>        <p>      Use a polyurethane sealant around all wires that penetrate      the house walls. It will take a close inspection to find      all of the holes that have been drilled for these items,      but a thorough sealing job will cure a lot of small,      nagging drafts.    </p>    <h3>      OTHER HOLES    </h3>        <p>      You'll probably be surprised to see how badly the frames of      exhaust vents, recessed lights, registers, and trapdoors      seal to the surrounding material. These ill-fitting devices      can let a tremendous amount of air into your home.      Remember, too, that vents-whether they be for      bathroom exhaust fans, your clothes dryer, or a range      hood-should have a flap that seals automatically when      the appliance isn't in use. In addition, if you have      registers that are closed off, install a magnetic seal over      them: Most operable registers leak at a rate of 30 to 40%      of maximum capacity when closed. (Be aware, however, that      furnaces with burners may overheat if too many registers      are closed.)    </p>    <p>      These ten steps will cut energy-wasting air leaks in your      home down to a tolerable level, but the building will      probably still allow enough air to pass through the shell      to keep the indoor environment fresh. In general, only      those buildings that were <em>built</em> to be tight will      need an air-to-air heat exchanger.    </p>   	 <p>      <em>If you're interested in getting into the business of      energy auditing and weatherization, the following companies      can offer blower door or energy-auditing packages.</em>    </p>    <p>      P.O.

Add insulation (if your dwelling doesn't      already have an adequate thermal blanket), have your      furnace tuned, replace its air filter, insulate your water      heater's tank and delivery lines, install water-saving      shower heads and faucets, and consider using products such      as insulating pads for your beds, destratification fans to      pull warm air down from the ceiling, or a clothes dryer      heat exchanger. By sealing up tight and then nibbling away      at the energy wasters in your household, you can save a      small fortune every winter!    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      The Energy-Auditing Business    </h2>    <p>      <em>Making house calls as an energy doctor is a profession      with obvious potential. Eighty percent of the housing      that's available today will still be in use when the year      2000 rolls around, and at least half of those buildings are      veritable energy sieves. It's hard enough now to pay the      utility bills on an energy eater, and as fuel prices rise,      owners of such dwellings are going to need help!</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Carl Ellerbrook says that it takes about $10,000 to get      started in the energy-auditing and weatherization business      . . . that's enough to cover equipment, materials, and      advertising. You'll need a blower door, a smoke pencil, a      tape measure, a compass, plastic sheets, and tape to      perform the energy audit. Then a ladder, a caulking gun, a      drill, a carpet kick tool, and common hand tools will be      needed to make the repairs.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You’ll also have to keep a stock of      weatherization supplies on hand. These include polyurethane      foam, caulking, outlet seals and plugs, backer rod, vinyl      door sweeps, and storm window kits. An average house of      1,800 square feet could need as many as 50 tubes of caulk,      5 pounds of polyurethane foam, and 100 outlet and switch      gaskets. Be sure to keep paper towels, bags, and a can of      acetate on hand to clean up spills.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It's best to work in pairs when weatherizing a house. .      . some jobs just seem to demand at least three hands. Also,      you can expect to put in 30 to 60 person-hours on each      building, so doubling up gets you in and out of a      customer's home more quickly.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>You should find it easy to get people excited about      saving energy if you can convince them that they'll also be      saving money. Use simple advertisements in newspapers,      fliers, and word of mouth to get your message out. Be sure      to let people know that you can offer either a basic energy      audit or complete service, including weatherization.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Your audit should consist of measuring the air changes      per hour of the house (this is done with the blower door),      inspecting the building for problem areas, and reporting to      the homeowneron the procedures you recommend (include a      prioritized list of steps to be taken and the savings      possible with each). You should offer other basic energy      conservation materials and services, such as insulation,      water-saving faucets, and water heater insulation.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The actual amount you charge will vary greatly      depending on the job. Ellerbrook's Sunup Energy Group Ltd.      charges 35 cents to 50 cents per square foot of floor area      for its services. A small weatherization business can grow      rapidly within a few years. Ellerbrook started in 1982 and      has already joined with architect Peter Dobrovolny to form      a full-service residential energy business. Sunup now      offers complete active and passive solar consulting, a      passive solar design and construction service, and retail      sales of energy-conserving products, along with home energy      audits and weatherization.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>With today's heightened energy consciousness, the time      is ripe to market conservation.</em>    </p>
