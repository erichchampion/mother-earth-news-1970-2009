                    <p>      Leonardo DiCaprio aside, the 30-year-old environmental      movement is as strong as ever. According to a Gallup Poll      conducted in March, 73% of the 1,004 adults polled consider      ecoawareness as, if not more, important than it was in      1970. Moreover, Americans seem to be taking more action.    </p>    <p>      In 1970, both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and      Earth Day were born. The EPA was created as a response to      the public's concern over the buildup of several decades'      worth of pollution. (Rachel Carson's 1962 book,      <em>Silent</em> <em>Spring</em> detailed the widespread use      of pesticides and also helped to spur public interest in      protecting the environment.) Earth Day - also formed in      1970 - launched the idea of environmentalism as we know it      today: that we are all responsible for the upkeep of the      planet, and that the government has an obligation to      protect the environment and punish those who pollute it.    </p>    <p>      Since 1970, the EPA and Earth Day have only grown in      importance. The agency's 2000 budget is more than seven      times that of 1970's $1 billion. Plus, over 18,000      employees now work for the agency, compared to nearly 4,100      in 1970. The Earth Day 2000 Gallup Poll also suggests that      the U.S. has become more active in environmental concerns,      while adopting the now-familiar slogan "think globally, act      locally." According to the poll 90% of Americans are      recycling, 83% are trying to use less water, and 73% are      buying environmentally beneficial products. In addition,      28% of the adults asked have voted or worked for candidates      because of their position on the environment, 18% have      contacted a public official about an environmental issue,      and 13% have contacted a business to voice concern over the      environmental impact of their products.    </p>    <p>      To its credit the environmental movement has come a long      way since its inception 30 years ago when, on the original      Earth Day, protesters dragged a net full of fish down Fifth      Avenue in New York City, proclaiming "this could be you" to      onlookers. But today there are more power plants,      pesticides and trash dumps than ever before, not to mention      the newer challenges to the planet of overpopulation and      genetically modified food. If we plan to sustain a healthy      environment over the next 30 years, we're going to need to      be at least as productive as the last 30.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Michael Asprion</em>    </p>
