                        <p>      In December 1999, when the Environmental Protection Agency      (EPA) ordered 392 electric generating power plants in the      Midwest and South to cut their emissions in half, New York      State breathed a toxic sigh of relief. The Empire State,      along with most of New England, had been fighting for clean      air and acid-free rain for nearly 30 years when the EPA      took its longoverdue stand. Since the Clean Air Act of 1970      was amended to the Constitution, older coal-burning power      plants from West Virginia to Illinois have been allowed to      skirt federal emission standards through a loophole known      as the "grandfather clause." Unfortunately for those states      downwind, already-existing plants were not required to pay      to modernize their equipment. Now, says the EPA, enough is      enough.    </p>    <p>      Nevertheless. New York is not satisfied. In an attempt to      further choke off smog-producing smokestacks, the state      passed a bill in May, that directly challenges yet another      loophole in the Clean Air Act: pollution credits. It is the      first and only legislation by a state against the federal      act, which allots credits to power plants when they meet      federal emission standards. Much like stock options, these      credits - introduced and ratified by the U.S. Congress as      part of the Clean Air Act of 1990 - can be bought and sold      on an open market so that dirty plants who can't or are      unwilling to meet federal clean air standards can pay for      the right to pollute by acquiring credits from those that      can. In passing the bipartisan legislation by a vote of      59-0, the Republican-controlled state Senate seeks to      regulate sales of pollution credits from cleaner New York      power plants to smog producing out-of-state plants.    </p>    <p>      "New York has been voluntarily paying more for its      electricity to reduce pollution for years," says John      Sheehan of the Adirondack Council, an environmental group      in Albany, New York, "to the point that it has the second      cleanest utilities in the country right behind California.      From an economic perspective it only makes sense to protect      that investment by keeping our utilities from squandering      it."    </p>    <p>      In forcing the issue, New York will no doubt be stepping on      some toes in the private sector - utility companies in the      state are already planning to bring suit, claiming that the      bill violates the interstate commerce clause in the U.S.      Constitution. Still, such groundbreaking legislation could      prove to be infectious. According to Sheehan, every state      from Maryland to Maine has asked for copies of the New York      legislation, and New Hampshire is planning to draft its own      version of the bill. The sooner clean air is a nationwide      mandate, the sooner we can all breathe a little easier.    </p>    <p>      <em>- Sam Martin</em>    </p>
