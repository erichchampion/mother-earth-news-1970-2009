                <p>      <em>Take your bicycle out of winter storage and put it to      use when you make this . . .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by William Kolberg    </h5>    <p>      I'm a carpenter . . . and for years I assumed that the best      way to cut wood was to plug in and "go with the flow." For      small jobs I'd still use my trusty handsaw, but for long,      straight cuts I'd grab my two-horsepower circular saw and      seek the nearest three-prong outlet.    </p>        <p>      That was OK when I was at a contract job site, but when I      was working at home - especially through our mean,      lean Wisconsin winters - it seemed as if a goodly      share of my profits was being metered away to the local      utility company while I was left with the crumbs.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, the cold season also kept me from my      favorite pastime, bicycling. So, in order to fit one      solution to these two seemingly disparate problems, I      researched - then built - my "bandcycle" . . .      a bicycle-powered band saw that makes accurate crosscuts,      rip cuts, and miter cuts through soft- and hard-wood, and      - with a simple blade change - saws through      mild steel and aluminum as well!    </p>    <p>      Because the tool is made almost exclusively of common      materials and salvaged bicycle parts, it cost me a good      deal less than a commercial model with similar features.      And though I'm not about to claim that it's as convenient      or powerful as an electric saw, it's a heck of a lot      cheaper - and even sort of fun - to operate.    </p>    <h3>      BAND SAW BASICS    </h3>    <p>      I didn't reinvent the wheel when I pieced together my      bandcycle. In fact, I just patterned my design after a      conventional band saw. Typically, the lower wheel is held      rigidly on its axis, while the upper wheel axle can be      tilted a few degrees from horizontal to keep the blade from      wandering off the rim.    </p>        <p>      That toothed steel band passes through a slotted table and      is held in line by two guides, which keep the blade in      position when it makes long, straight cuts and also prevent      it from twisting on a curved slice. In addition, the guide      above the table is adjustable to accommodate various      thicknesses of stock, and both guides incorporate a thrust      roller that runs against the back of the blade to keep it      from being pushed off the wheels under pressure. Finally,      band saw wheels are usually fitted with flat rubber tires      to protect the set in the teeth and to prevent blade      slippage.    </p>    <p>      So, the only significant differences between any old band      saw and my cycle saw are these: [1] I've done away with the      drive motor, and [2] I've added a set of brackets to hold      the rear wheel of my three-speed firmly against the lower      wheel of the saw.    </p>    <h3>      A MATERIAL MATTER    </h3>    <p>      To construct your own pedal-powered version of my      invention, take a look at the materials list included in      this article and begin gathering the necessary parts. When      scrounging for the 24" pipe that will serve as the various      bracket collars, make sure it slides easily - but not      too loosely - over a sample piece of the 1" tubing      that's to be used for the saw's frame; a good fit here will      assure an accurate cut later on. (While 1-1/4" iron pipe      will come close, it's not the best choice. Try to find some      chain link fence rail or mechanical tubing like that used      on scaffolding or implement frames.)    </p>    <p>      Also, be certain the wheel assemblies you choose are fully      spoked and straight. Though you could probably buy the flat      rubber tires for the rims at an industrial supply company,      you can make do by stretching sliced sections of truck      inner tube over the wheels or even using a couple of bike      rim strips to make rubber "pads" for each wheel.    </p>    <p>      At $26 a pair, commercially made blade guides might be a      bit pricey for your budget, but you can make your own,      using the instructions I'll provide later. As for the      blade, you're going to have to buy that, so pick something      that'll handle general woodcutting chores to start . . . a      3/4" X 14' band with 4 or 6 teeth per inch suits my needs.      (A saw-sharpening shop should be able to fix you up, but      double-check the blade length required by <em>your</em>      tool before you put down your money.)    </p>                <h3>      A FITTING PROPOSITION    </h3>    <p>      As you can see from the photos and illustration, the      biggest part of the bandcycle is the tubular frame. Buy or      borrow a conduit bender with a 1" jaw capacity and do your      best to form two identical elongated S-shaped members, as      shown. Ideally, the uprights should be nearly 6' long, the      legs 15" in length, and the horizontals 12" between bends.    </p>    <p>      With the frame formed, drill a series of holes in the      outside of each upright, starting about 4" from what will      be the top end. File these to create elongated adjustment      slots in the tubing. Next, cut part of your scrounged 2'      collar pipe into four 3" lengths and weld them (or have      them welded) to the legs of each conduit upright so they'll      protrude perpendicularly from the same side the slots are      in. Drill two 1/4" holes - parallel to the uprights      and about 2" apart - through each piece, and, using      one of the bike wheels as a spacing guide, fasten the frame      members to the center of a 3/4" X 21" X 30" section of      plywood with 1/4" X 2-1/2" carriage bolts.    </p>    <p>      Next, you can tackle the collars that hold the axle      brackets, blade guides, and table supports to the frame.      Cut the remaining 12" of collar pipe into eight 1-1/2"      lengths, and weld a 1/8" X 1-1/2" X 2" tab to one side of      each collar. Then drill and saw 3/8" X 1-1/4" slots into      four of the collar tabs (clamp them together to form pairs,      then cut one set vertically and the other set      horizontally).    </p>    <p>      Now take the four <em>unslotted</em> collar assemblies and      the two horizontally slotted ones and weld 1/8" X 1/2" X      1-1/2" strips to their sides. By drilling two 13/64" holes      through each of these built-up areas and threading them      with a 1/4-20 tap, you'll be able to place 1/4" X 1/2"      <em>hexsocket</em> set screws into the holes and use them      to lock the collars into position on the tubular frame      uprights.    </p>    <p>      The remaining vertically slotted collars get a different      treatment, but all it involves is drilling a 1/4" hole      through the outside of the collars and bending each of a      pair of 1/4" X 6" threaded rods into an L shape. The      shorter part of each L will pass through its frame slot and      collar hole to be held with a nut, while the longer shaft      will protrude through the top of the frame and be drawn      upward with a nut pushing against a flat washer.    </p>    <p>      To finish up, you'll need to weld the 1/8" X 1-1/2" X 14"      table supports to the tabs on two of the tapped collars,      then bolt the 1/8" X 1-1/2" X 2" angle iron brackets to the      ends of these supports. Also, after installing the lower      axle brackets and slipping the wheel in place, you'll have      to determine the exact length of the 1/8" X 1-1/2" blade      guide support by lining it up with the recess in the rim.      Be prepared to make some minor adjustments to suit your      particular blade guides; the manufactured type will require      a 3/4" X 1-1/2" shoulder at the tip.    </p>    <p>      If you want to make your own blade guides, you can do so      easily, using a 4" length of 1/8" X 1" angle iron, a 1/8" X      1" X 1-3/4" piece of flat stock, four No. 10 X 1/2" machine      screws, a 1/4" X 1" bolt with two nuts and three washers,      and a 1/2"-bore, 1-1/8" OD (No. Z99R8) sealed bearing.    </p>    <p>      Cut a 1" section from the angle and drill two slotted      mounting holes through one side of it. Bolt it against the      face of the remaining piece at one end, then fasten the      hunk of flat stock in line with the protruding side of the      1" angle. Mount the bearing just above these two flat      "fingers," allowing it to ride on a 1/4" nut threaded      against a washer and the bolt head. Then trim the lateral      guides so they don't disturb the set of the blade teeth,      adjust the gap to suit its width, and bolt the assemblies      to the guide supports.    </p>        <p>      While the rim's still in place, determine the proper      position for the 1/8" X 2" X 3" axle brackets that'll      support your <em>bicycle's</em> rear wheel. Hold your bike      tire up against the rim and mark where the axle falls on      the saw frame's horizontals. Make 3/8" X 2" slots in the      bracket plates and weld them with their midpoints over the      marks.    </p>    <p>      Finally, cut the 18" X 18" table from your remaining piece      of 3/4" plywood and position it for mounting. Remember to      slice a groove in the board to accommodate the blade. Once      you've gotten the proper length band, place it around the      wheels - with the teeth nearest the table pointing      downward - and tighten the lower axle. Draw the upper      adjustment shafts upward as necessary to make the blade      "track" near the center of the rim.    </p>    <p>      To lock your bike to the frame, let some air out of the      rear tire and press it against the blade with its axle in      the brackets. Tighten the axle nuts and fill the tire until      you achieve good traction, then just let 'er rip!    </p>    <p>      The pedaling half of your team should maintain a steady,      even pace while the cutter guides the stock into the blade.      Intense bursts of pedal speed won't cut the wood any      faster, and feeding the wood too fast will just bog down      the "motor." Sixty revolutions per minute at the pedals (a      reasonable cruising rate) moves an impressive 1,025 feet of      blade through your work every minute . . . enough to slice      any board.    </p>    <p>      About the only low-buck improvement that I could suggest      for the bandcycle is the addition of a flywheel, which I      incorporated right into the lower wheel a few months after      building the saw (see the sidebar). The added mass      discourages bogging, smooths out the cut, and in general      makes this unique tool nearly as practical as its      current-hungry cousin!    </p>    <h3>      One Good Turn Deserves Another    </h3>    <p>      A flywheel is a simple rotary device used to store kinetic      energy. Its mass, once set in motion, has enough inertia to      continue that motion at a fairly steady rate. If mass      - in the form of concrete - is added to one of      the bandcycle's wheels, the moving blade will be more      resistant to velocity changes brought about by knots or      dense grain, and thus won't snag or bog.    </p>    <p>      To make the flywheel, simply lace about 15 feet of baling      wire through the spokes of your truer wheel. Distribute the      wire evenly and wrap it around the spokes, crossing from      right to left sides at various places to create a network      within the wheel that will support the concrete disk.    </p>    <p>      Next, cut a sheet of cardboard to the exact diameter of      your rim, pierce its center to accommodate the axle and hub      shoulder, and use some duct tape to seal the perimeter of      the cardboard circle tightly to the edge of the rim. Now      coat the exposed axle and hub shoulder surfaces with grease      or petroleum jelly to protect the threads and bearings.    </p>    <p>      Set the wheel, cardboard down, onto an old car tire, and      prepare to mix your mud. I found that a 60-pound bag of      preblended mortar mix was just about perfect for the job.      Be sure to wear rubber gloves throughout the casting      process, or you'll learn, as I did, that the highly      alkaline cement will damage your skin.    </p>    <p>      Add water slowly to the mix to achieve the perfect      consistency . . . one that flows slowly and easily and that      can be formed with a trowel or straightedge. Scoop the      batter gently into the mold, and use a stick to dislodge      and fill any hidden air pockets. Once the wheel is "topped      off, " smooth the mortar with a straightedge and scrape      away any excess, being careful to use the rim edge as a      guide to avoid exposing the spokes.    </p>    <p>      The concrete will take from one day to a week to cure,      depending upon the temperature. In hot climates, you may      have to mist the casting occasionally to keep it moist,      while a freezing environment will require that you cover      the mortar with plastic and a thick layer of straw. Once      it's set, you can bolt it to the bandcycle's lower bracket      and start throwing your weight around!    </p>
