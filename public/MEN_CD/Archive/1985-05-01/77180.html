                    <p>      Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. But while most      folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing in the      areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us - for      instance - have read Paul's book The Population Bomb      <em>), few people have any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs      are involved in ecological research (the type that tends to      be published only in technical journals and college texts).      That's why we're pleased to present this regular      semitechnical column by these well-known      authors/ecologists/educators.</em>    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      The Serengeti: A Natural Ecosystem Part III</h2>   <h5 id="byline">by Anne and Paul      Ehrlich</h5>        <p>      In our last two columns, we examined some of the      intricacies of the complex Serengeti ecosystem. But what      can be said of the <em>stability</em> of the system? If      it's disturbed, does it return to its previous state? Two      large-scale disruptions of the system have been observed      historically. The first was a great epidemic of rinderpest,      a ruminant-attacking viral disease that's native to the      steppes of Asia. The origin of the epidemic may have been      viruses introduced with cattle brought to Africa by the      British from Russia in 1884, during their unsuccessful      attempt to relieve General "Chinese" Gordon at the battle      of Khartoum. Or it may have been introduced around 1889      with zebu cattle brought from India to Abyssinia to feed      Italian troops.    </p>    <p>      Whatever its origin, the disease first attacked the cattle      of the Masai and other herding tribes. This led to      disastrous famines between the 1890's and 1920, in which at      least two-thirds of the Masai perished. By 1890 the disease      had moved into native ruminants, and the buffalo,      wildebeests, and giraffes were disappearing.    </p>    <p>      The decimation of the herbivores caused the predators to      starve, and some lions switched to eating people. The      man-eating lions of Tsavo became famous in 1898, and in      1920 there was an outbreak in Uganda in which a single lion      was reported to have devoured 84 people.    </p>    <p>      The appearance of the man-eaters led to the abandonment of      land by cultivators, and this, combined with the      disappearance of the herders and the native grazing and      browsing animals, opened the door to a reinvasion of plains      areas by woodland flora. Then, by 1910 or so, the wild      ruminants began to become resistant to the disease, and the      resultant increased population of grazers nourished tsetse      flies, which expanded <em>their</em> range into the new      brushy areas. The sleeping sickness carried by the tsetse      fly further reduced the region's human population..    </p>    <p>      In the 1930's, brush-control programs gradually brought the      tsetse flies under control, and vaccination began to reduce      the impact of rinderpest on the cattle population. The      native ruminants' resistance to the rinderpest virus slowly      became stronger until the disease killed only yearlings      that had not yet acquired immunity and then, finally, it      disappeared altogether in the early 1960's.    </p>    <p>      The results were dramatic. The survival of wildebeest      yearlings increased from 25% to 50% and the total      population of these ruminants shot up from a quarter      million in 1961 to a half million in 1967. Furthermore,      buffalo increased from 30,000 to 50,000 during the same      period. Interestingly, the nonruminant zebras, immune to      rinderpest, showed no such population changes.    </p>    <p>      On our visit to the Serengeti with THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>      Tours in 1984, we were told that rinderpest had reappeared      among the buffalo, causing heavy mortality in the      Ngorongoro Crater population. The significance of this is      not readily apparent, however, since research on the      Serengetiecosystem has unfortunately declined as Tanzania's      economic condition has worsened.    </p>    <h3>      More Grass for Grazers    </h3>    <p>      The second major observed disturbance of the Serengeti      system was the increase in dry-season precipitation in 1971      to 1976, as mentioned in the first part of this series.      This raised the productivity of grasslands at the time when      it's usually at a low point. That, in turn, caused a      further increase in wildebeest and buffalo; the wildebeest      population reached about 1.3 million by 1977.    </p>    <p>      For reasons that are not clear, there was no parallel      effect upon the numbers of other grazers such as zebras.      (There <em>was</em> some sign that the competition for food      resources by wildebeests somewhat slowed the increase of      buffalo, even though there was no evidence of a reverse      effect.) There may be competition between wildebeests and      zebras, which could have led to a small decline in the      latter, but census data are not adequate to document it.    </p>    <p>      The increase in wildebeests may have had a positive effect      on the population size of Grant's gazelles by altering      their relationship to plants. Growth of forbs (herbaceous      plants other than grass) is favored when intense grazing      keeps the grasses short and thus less able to shade out the      forbs . . . and gazelles prefer to eat forbs. The      proliferation of gazelles may have been responsible for an      increase in cheetahs, which feed heavily upon them.    </p>    <p>      The explosion in the wildebeest population might have been      expected to benefit their predators - lions and      hyenas - but such was not the case. The      post-rinderpest wildebeest population rise was not      paralleled by an increase in the numbers of lions and      hyenas, apparently because the territorial populations of      these two predators are controlled by the scarcity of food      during the period when the migratory wildebeests are      absent. However, the predators did respond to the increase      in nonmigratory ungulates (topi, kongoni, and warthogs)      caused by greater rainfall. In the early 1970's, lions      nearly doubled in number, and the hyena population      increased by almost 50%. As a result, the wild dog      population declined because of fiercer competition from      other predators that preempted wild dog kills and because      of direct predation on their pups by hyenas.    </p>    <p>      Other elements of the system also changed. Increased      rainfall reduced the frequency of dry-season fires; that,      in turn, helped the survival of small acacia trees leading      to increased numbers of giraffes. These animals tend to      keep the small trees from "escaping" into the mature class      - growing too tall for the giraffes to eat them. But      the mature trees are killed by elephants, which push them      over. Thus, the altered rainfall pattern affected a      complex, dynamic fire-tree-giraffe-elephant system that may      cycle over considerable periods because of the long      generation times of the organisms involved.    </p>        <h3>      One Thing Leads to Another    </h3>    <p>      Some major linkages in the complex Serengeti system are      shown in the accompanying diagram. The feeding sequences      indicated, such as forbs - Grant's gazelles -      cheetahs . . . or grass - buffalo - lions, are      technically known as <em>food chains</em> . Although the      diagram doesn't show it, these chains are actually woven      into more complex <em>food webs</em> . For example, lions      eat Grant's gazelles, wildebeests, buffalo, and giraffes      (even though this has no major effect on their numbers),      and Grant's gazelles eat some grass along with their forbs.    </p>    <p>      The entire ecosystem, of course, is driven by the energy of      the sun. The sun's heat evaporates the oceanic waters that      eventually rain on the Serengeti. More important, the sun's      energy is captured by green plants in the process of      <em>photosynthesis</em> , converting the radiant form of      energy in sunlight into chemical energy in the bonds of      sugar molecules and in those of other carbohydrates. That      chemicalbond energy is then used by the plants and by      successive <em>trophic</em> (feeding) <em>levels up</em>      the food chains - from herbivores to predators to      decomposers.    </p>    <p>      But, as described by the second law of thermodynamics, the      amount of energy available to each trophic level declines      with each successive upward step. According to the second      law, whenever energy - which can be described as the      stored capacity for work - is used to <em>do</em>      such work, some of it becomes unavailable for further work.      We'll deal in detail with this important law in a future      column, but its significance here is that, in any      ecosystem, more energy is available to support plants than      herbivores, more to support herbivores than carnivores, and      so on.    </p>    <p>      Because of the steady loss of availability of energy as it      moves through food chains, energy must make a one-way trip      through ecosystems: It cannot be recycled. In contrast,      nutrients <em>can</em> be recycled; they tend to move in      circular paths through ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      The nutrients in plants are acquired by herbivores when      they eat plants and by carnivores when they eat herbivores.      The nutrients are then incorporated into the complex      chemical molecules of the plants and animals.    </p>    <p>      At the end of all food chains, the decomposers do a final      breakdown, returning the nutrient elements from the      biological to the physical part of the ecosystem -      usually to the soil, from which plants can take them up      again.    </p>    <h3>      From One to All    </h3>    <p>      The basic structure of the Serengeti system - food      chains and webs through which useful energy passes on a      oneway trip and through which nutrients cycle - is      characteristic of <em>all</em> ecosystems.    </p>    <p>      To return to the question asked at the beginning of this      column, the paleontological record indicates that the major      features of the Serengeti - including its semiarid      climate - have been relatively stable for at least a      million years, and possibly for much longer. Changes come      and go, but the system appears always to return to roughly      the same state. The long-term stability of the climate is      critically important to this balance, however. It's clear,      for instance, that if the rainfall were to increase to a      point at which the major migrants became sedentary, the      entire structure of the system could change dramatically.    </p>    <p>      In future columns, we'll examine changes in ecosystems in      some detail, but in MOTHER NO. 94, we'll present a      <em>practical application</em> of the knowledge that's      resulted from the study of natural semiarid ecosystems in      East Africa.    </p>    <p>      <em>Details on the structure of the Serengeti ecosystem can      be found in</em> Serengeti: Dynamics of an Ecosystem      <em>(University of Chicago, 1979), by A.R.E. Sinclair and      M. Norton-Griffiths. The basic information in the diagram      is taken from this book. A more general treatment of      ecosystems is given in Ehrlich, Ehrlich, and Holdren,</em>      Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment <em>(Freeman      & Co., San Francisco, 1977).<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The Ehrlichs' work is supported in part by a grant from      the Koret Foundation of San Francisco.</em>    </p>
