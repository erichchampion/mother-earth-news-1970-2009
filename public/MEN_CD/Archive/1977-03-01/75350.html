                <p>      In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts      regarding one of mankind's better      ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting      suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter      and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER      could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the      department." "You're on!" we replied ... and announced our      stillstanding offer: Anyone (and that means <em>you!</em> )      who sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an      actual barter that's good enough to print will      receive-as the folks on the following pages      have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of      same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).    </p>        <p><strong>      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted), Inc., P.O. Box 70      Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</strong>    </p>    <p>      In these parts, hardly a day goes by that we farmers and      ranchers don't barter <em>something</em> , because so      <em>many</em> little things can <em>lead</em> to a swap.      Sometimes it's no more than a mess of fresh greens from      your neighbor that starts it. Not to be outdone, you even      the score with a sack of ground cornmeal, and so it goes.    </p>    <p>      But, besides these small everyday trades, I can recall many      larger-scale swaps that have taken place down through the      years.    </p>    <p>      The first bigger deal I ever transacted started out as a      joke. During a visit I paid to a neighbor lady, her son      commented about a young paint colt he'd seen at our house.      I laughed and said, "Yes, and I know a boy with a very      pretty calf. How about trading with me?"    </p>    <p>      Two or three days later, the young fellow and his parents      turned up at our place, wanting to know if we'd really      trade our colt for their calf, as the boy wouldn't let his      folks rest! Not only did we all have a good laugh ... my      family got both a nice steer for the freezer and the      satisfaction of watching a happy lad grow up with his      horse.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Herman B. Barnes<br />      Zavalla, Tex.    </p>    <p>      When anyone expresses an interest in the goods we have to      offer from our small farm, our first question is always,      "What do you have to trade?" The least welcome response is      "Money", and over the years we've swapped everything from      eggs and turnip greens for pecans and oranges to a      no-longer-used heater for a brake job on our pickup. The      whole concept adds an exciting dimension to our lives.    </p>    <p>      Recently we had an architect draw plans for a home to be      built on our acreage. After we took him a gallon of creamy      milk in appreciation of his "above and beyond" help, he      insisted in setting up a schedule of milk deliveries to      serve as his fee! Now, as the house is being built, we're      negotiating similar trades for the electrical wiring, the      plumbing, and even some of the construction materials. It      all adds up to a substantial saving on the cost of our new      dwelling.    </p>    <p>      We've discovered, in short, that nearly everyone is open to      barter if we make the first move.    </p>    <p>      Glen & Rita Dyer<br />      Victoria, Tex.    </p>    <p>      I was born and raised in the city, so for me barter was      just a word in history books. Then we moved to the country      ... and I found out that the exchange of goods and      services-with no money involved-is a living concept.    </p>    <p>      Our first trade happened the time we needed some lumber      moved. We had butchered a hog, and there was a young man      who had some extra time ... so we arranged to exchange some      of his spare hours for some of our fresh pork.    </p>    <p>      Also, we've already swapped surplus peaches for baby      calves, and three piglets we raised brought us building      lumber and some olive trees with which we've enclosed our      property.    </p>    <p>      And remember ... we're new at this!    </p>    <p>      Tony Lagera<br />      Corning, Calif.    </p>    <p>      Just before I moved to this state, a fellow who was short      of cash asked me to swap my sports car for his      four-wheel-drive truck. Now, three years later, the West      Virginia hills and mud have nearly worn the get-you-through      machine out ... but I'd have lost that low-slung Fiat on      the first unpaved road.    </p>    <p>      Then I was offered a Tri-Sport with its motor taken apart,      in lieu of money owed to me. I carried it home on the top      of my station wagon, a neighborhood boy put it back      together, and I traded it for a nine-foot patio door.    </p>    <p>      Most recently, after I'd moved a mobile home onto our      acreage, I needed the wheel assembly cut out from under the      building. For this reason, I was interested in talking a      deal when a young fellow who makes spinning wheels came by      to ask about some walnut logs we'd felled while bringing in      electrical lines. I told the craftsman he could have them      if he'd do my wheel cutting and then build me a trailer      from the axles we'd have left over. He did a fine job for      me ... and hasn't even come to pick up his walnut yet!    </p>    <p>      Well, that's the way we do things here in West Virginia ...      and, until I started reading MOTHER, I'd never even thought      of it as barter!    </p>    <p>      Earl M. Clough<br />      Rosedale, W. Va.    </p>    <p>      Incubating eggs has been a hobby of mine for quite some      time. So when my college roommate (an animal science major      like me) discovered an opportunity to buy goose eggs last      spring we <em>both</em> thought that hatching them would be      a real challenge in our little machines. We immediately      contacted the people who'd advertised the sale, but the      couple volunteered to <em>give</em> us some of the goose      eggs if we'd incubate some birds for them, too.    </p>    <p>      Though only a few of the eggs finally hatched (they weren't      very fertile) the deal still turned out great. We      discovered that the folks were also interested in starting      other projects with animals, but knew very little about      keeping different species. Since we wanted to raise some      critters ourselves (but couldn't think of it while we lived      in an apartment), it took us very little time to arrange a      swap: our know-how in taking care of rabbits, pigeons,      guinea pigs, chickens, quail, geese, and ducks ... in      return for space on their farm.    </p>    <p>      But best of all, we developed another close friendship ...      and all because of barter.    </p>    <p>      Russell J. Anderson<br />      North Amherst, Mass.    </p>    <p>      For my husband and me, trading is a way of life.    </p>    <p>      Last week we swapped a six-pack of beer for a deer that had      been killed by a car, then gave part of the venison to a      friend for his help in butchering the animal.    </p>    <p>      It's no trouble - and takes little time - for      us to ready our gardening neighbors' plots with our tractor      and plow, and deliver some rich manure from our barnyard      pile while we're at it. In return, we receive wonderful      fresh produce . . . some of it already processed, labeled,      and ready for the freezer.    </p>    <p>      We recently revived the time-honored custom of horse      trading, too, when we found ourselves with a registered      Morgan that needed professional training, a mare we wanted      to breed, and a younger mare for sale. We found new friends      who took a fancy to the filly and were willing to give us      10 months of training and the stud services of their good      "show stallion" for her.    </p>    <p>      To me, the greatest thing about our trades is that they're      tax free. Not only do we need less taxable income in order      to get by, but there's no sales tax on swaps!    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Richard Thoms<br />      Scottsville, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      The year before last I gave up my cushy but stifling      government job and moved back to the country. One of my      first projects was a solar-heated cabin . ' . a place free      from television, where I could think about life.    </p>    <p>      It became time to furnish my little hide-away about the      same time tax returns were due to be prepared. My own forms      were easy for a change, because I didn't have much to put      on them. But a couple I knew were in a considerably more      complicated situation. Since I'd had some training and      experience in tax law while working for Uncle Sam, they      asked me to do their computations for them. After some talk      we made a deal: I would prepare their return and they would      find a good used rocking chair for my cabin.    </p>    <p>      The outcome was that, with my specialized knowledge, I was      able to save them $200 which the government would otherwise      have spent on missiles. That in itself was satisfying. But,      in addition, I now have a high-backed rocking chair which      is not only handsome but represents the permanent presence      of those two friends in my home. That's something you don't      get with cash.    </p>    <p>      Dale Bradford<br />      Licking, Mo.    </p>    <p>      My husband and I have been swapping our labor and skills to      get the things we need for quite a while now. To us, it      seems such a natural way to live.    </p>    <p>      I had always wanted to learn to ride and train horses, for      instance, and one day my wish came true when a friend      offered to give me the lessons I couldn't afford in      exchange for a complete weekly cleaning of her barn.    </p>    <p>      My spouse, who used to be a carpenter, built a shop for his      dentist in return for dental work of equal value. A few      months later, he built a covered patio for my dentist, to      "pay" for the extraction of my wisdom teeth.    </p>    <p>      Now my husband's running a motorcycle repair shop, where he      finds trades especially easy to transact. The latest one      was with a customer (now a friend) who put in all the leach      lines at our new place in exchange for the rebuilding of      his two" bikes".    </p>    <p>      These are only a few examples of our swapping successes.      Enough, though, to demonstrate that, in the game of barter,      everyone wins!    </p>    <p>      Mary Wild<br />      Sacramento, Calif.    </p>    <p>      Since we farm the old way - with horses - and      put loose hay in the barn, it's easier if there's more than      one doing the work. So my brother-in-law and I help each      other with the hay. One loads up in the field while the      other one unloads and mows the hay back in the barn. We      also cooperate when it comes to grain threshing and silo      filling.    </p>    <p>      I recently picked some of my father-in-law's apples for      him, as he can't climb trees. For my trouble, he gave me 7      of the 14 bushels I harvested.    </p>    <p>      Then there was the time I needed help with some different      jobs I had to do, and a friend of mine wanted to buy a      certain horse I had but couldn't raise the necessary cash.      He traded me his labor for the horse, and we both came out      ahead.    </p>    <p>      And here's another swap that works: This is hilly country,      and my neighbor has trouble getting to one of his fields.      So he gave me a hard-to-find wheel rim that I urgently      needed, and now I let him cross my land for easier access      to his tract.    </p>    <p>      Merle G. Yoder<br />      Tomah, Wis.    </p>    <p>      Our neighbor has a dairy cow that gives six quarts a day,      which is more than the fellow's small family can use. So      we've been offered the privilege of milking the old girl      each evening, in exchange for an infrequent barn cleanup.      And since three daily quarts is a little much for      <em>us</em> , we occasionally give some of Bossy's      abundance to another local acquaintance in exchange for a      hot bath (we're still a little primitive on our place).    </p>    <p>      Here are just a few of the other rewarding trades we've      been able to make: For removing someone's old wood stove,      we had our pork smoked. For repairing our current house, we      had the rent reduced. And my husband has been helping a      friend chop and haul his wood, thereby ensuring our own      winter fuel supply.    </p>    <p>      I feel good inside when people come to us and offer their      help. I know <em>they</em> know that we'll always return      the services.    </p>    <p>      Maureen Dionne<br />      St. Urbain de Charlevoix, Que.<br />      Canada    </p>    <p>      Our cabin site - a shelf bulldozed out of a hillside      - was just big enough for the dwelling plus a very      small garden. We wanted more level ground for parking and      additional growing space, but the proposed excavation      - we found - would cost more than our budget      allowed.    </p>    <p>      Then, one afternoon when I had stopped at the local tavern      for a cold one, I met the general foreman for a nearby      utility company construction job. It was the start of the      rainy season, and the fellow was bemoaning the fact that      his equipment yard was becoming a sea of mud. Worse yet,      his request to the county for permission to dig surfacing      material from an unused county facility had been denied.    </p>    <p>      Well, I got to thinking, "The subsoil exposed at my place      had all been decomposed granite. Hmmm ......    </p>    <p>      And that led me to tell the foreman I needed a little      excavating done and that he was welcome to all the fill      material he wanted to haul away. Result: A couple of days      later a bulldozer, a front-end loader, and several dump      trucks appeared and went to work. Within a few days the      size of our cabin and garden site had been doubled, the      equipment yard got a good surfacing, and everyone was      satisfied.    </p>    <p>      Michael McMullen<br />      Santa Margarita, Calif.    </p>    <p>      Last Christmas my sister was given a lovely basket,      hand-woven of cedar bark like the ones the Indians of this      area used to make. That gift led <em>me</em> to a kind of      exchange that just might be unique.    </p>    <p>      I made inquiries, and eventually found the basket's weaver,      a 97-year-old Indian woman who had learned the art by      watching her mother and grandmother at work . She was still      going strong at her craft, but it had become difficult for      her to gather the bark, reeds, and grasses she needed.    </p>    <p>      It wasn't long before we came to an unspoken agreement: She      would teach me to weave baskets, and I would provide the      time, energy, and transportation involved in gathering the      materials (an education in itself).    </p>    <p>      It's working out great. My new friend is able to continue      her work, and I'm learning the precious, disappearing art      of Northwest Indian basketry ... and, in the process,      getting to know a beautiful old woman with a rich cultural      heritage.    </p>    <p>      Mary Hamilton<br />      Bremerton, Wash.    </p>    <p>      A year ago we made the move to the country ... a move that      greatly changed (for the better!) our attitudes about      neighbors.    </p>    <p>      The bartering started in the spring. My father wanted a big      garden, but had no way to ready his chosen area. So I      painted the trim of our neighbor's new barn, and he plowed      and disced Dad's plot.    </p>    <p>      I soon struck another bargain with the same good neighbor.      Our grapevines won't produce a harvest for another year or      two, but thanks to him we haven't gone without grapes. For      doing the work on his vines (pruning, fertilizing, etc.) I      was given half the yield. So we not only had luscious fresh      fruit, but surplus grapes to give to my brothers, who make      wine. We also took them lots of empty bottles, and when the      vino is aged we'll get a few of those bottles back, full.)    </p>    <p>      Another of my favorite swaps has helped me get started on a      new hobby: fiddling! I had the fiddle, but it needed      strings and a new bow. So, in return for some babysitting,      the folks across the road (who own a music store) gave me      everything I lacked.    </p>    <p>      Not bad for one year into the new life!    </p>    <p>      Kathleen Gordinier<br />      Walworth, N.Y.    </p>    <p>      Where we live (on a small island surrounded by a great      ocean) you wouldn't expect there to be a premium value on      fish. Yet, in the two years we've been here, my wife and I      have found that the 15 other families in our agriculturally      based village particularly prize seafood.    </p>    <p>      One evening, coming home from fishing, I decided I had a      larger catch than we could eat. So I stopped at some      neighbors' houses to share my surplus. The recipients were      very pleased, and thanked me with wine.    </p>    <p>      The real surprise, however, came the next morning when we      went to buy milk. Not only did our neighbors refuse to be      paid ... they threw in a fresh cheese besides! And, later,      we were brought gifts of bread, eggs, and sweet potatoes.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, I've been seeing to it ever since that our extra      fish go to appreciative homes and, to be honest, the whole      thing has gotten completely out of hand. I recently poured      a cement floor and the five men who worked with me all day      refused to accept anything for their labors but a cup of      wine. My wife is even becoming too embarrassed to go      shopping because, it seems, hardly anyone will allow us to      pay for anything anymore!    </p>    <p>      Andy Schmelling<br />      Azores, Portugal    </p>    <p>      When you're tucking away all the cash you can save toward      the purchase of that long-dreamed-of homestead, swapping      becomes a necessary part of your life.    </p>    <p>      In the past year alone, our instances of successful trades      have included a goat for a quilt, repairs made on a car for      patched blue jeans, and a doctor's assistance at our son's      birth for gardening work.    </p>    <p>      Now our community has initiated a barter directory, in      which people can list their names and the skills or items      that they want to exchange.    </p>    <p>      I guess we should be checking the guide to find som-eone      who has land to swap ... then we could forget about the      money for that, too!    </p>    <p>      The Dixons<br />      Lompoc, Calif.    </p>
