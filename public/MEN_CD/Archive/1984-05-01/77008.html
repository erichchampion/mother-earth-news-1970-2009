As you surely know, it's very expensive to board      critters at a kennel, and it upsets our house pets to be      caged in unfamiliar surroundings.<br />      <br />      A friend who likes animals offered to care for them at our      home while we were gone, but we felt awkward about paying      him for the favor. After giving the matter a good bit of      thought, a barter idea popped into my head. I remembered      his telling us that his two young daughters were eager to      learn how to swim but were too timid to sign up for group      lessons at the municipal pool. Since I have access to a      swimming pool and used to teach Red Cross swimming lessons,      I proposed that we trade pet care for swimming      lessons.<br />      <br />      Our pets were pampered in our absence, the girls made good      progress in learning the basic swimming skills, and we plan      to repeat the swap again next summer.<br />      <br />      Mrs. L.W.<br />      Kansas<br />      <br />      After reading your "Swaps" column for some time, I was      inspired to think of innovative ways to barter. And I've      been so successful at doing so that I'm now conducting a      seminar entitled "Bartering, Trading, Swapping" for a local      community service foundation. In exchange for my putting on      this workshop, the group is sponsoring another one of my      classes on "Simple Living and Money". I've also been      invited to be on a local talk show to discuss the      principles of barter.<br />      <br />      So, thanks, MOTHER, not only for encouraging me to try      barter, but for helping <em>me</em> start on a new career      of teaching people to help <em>themselves</em> !<br />      <br />      C.B.R.<br />      California<br />      <br />      As a naturopathic physician specializing in home      deliveries, I often have patients whose unplanned, but much      wanted, pregnancies have put a strain on their finances.      Therefore, I'm always open to bartering my services and      have traded for all sorts of things over the years . . .      including a rug from Bolivia, an opal necklace, and a      pumpkin cheesecake!    </p>        <p>      Last year, when I was furnishing my new home, I realized      that I didn't <em>own</em> much in the way of furniture,      dishes, etc. So, when a young couple came to my office      inquiring about a home delivery that they were afraid they      couldn't afford, I was delighted to discover that the      husband was a potter.<br />      <br />      We agreed to exchange the delivery charge for a lovely set      of plates, bowls, and mugs. The teacher of the birth      preparation class got into the act by trading the      registration fee for a pitcher and a set of mugs to, use in      the birthing room. And, since many of the class      participants have since noticed that pottery and wanted      pieces of their own, the trade improved the potter's      business, the birthing room, and my home.<br />      <br />      M.S.<br />      Oregon<br />      <br />      A few years ago I read an article in MOTHER (issue 48, page      33) by Jane and Steve Fry entitled "We Call 'Em 'Dough      Babies'". The project outlined in that feature sounded like      fun, so I mixed up a batch of the ingredients and created a      few ornaments for the family Christmas tree. By the spring      of 1983, after a lot of practice, I felt my dough art had      become good enough to market.<br />      <br />      However, the Christmas season had passed, and tree      ornaments were not in demand that spring, so I decided to      design a few refrigerator magnets and offer them for sale.      Because I already had a good supply of the flour, salt,      paints, and varnish required, my only initial investment      was $25 for some magnetic stripping. I started out by      making two dozen each of six different shapes. Those first      figures were mushrooms, owls, ladybugs, frogs, clowns, and      turtles.<br />      <br />      About the time I finished that first batch of refrigerator      magnets, I had a garage sale. I displayed the figures and      priced them at $1.50 each. I didn't really have much hope      of anyone buying the decorations at that type of sale, but      I thought if I sold even one it would give me the      confidence to try marketing them through craft shops and      the like. Well, by the end of the three-day event, I'd sold      not just one magnet, but <em>all</em> of them, for a gross      of $216. And though I had none left to take around to gift      shops, I was pretty certain that, when I made a new batch,      my creations would be <em>very</em> marketable.<br />      <br />      So, I got busy and baked twice as many dough figures as I      had before. I took them to craft stores, small grocery      outlets, and drug stores. I charged a fixed price of      75 cents for each one and worked on a cash-only basis right      from the start. It was only one week before my new      collection of dough magnets was sold.<br />      <br />      That second success encouraged me to improve my system by      designing a schedule for myself. For the rest of 1983, I      made magnets for two weeks at a time and then sold them      during the following two weeks. That arrangement seems to      be the right one for me; my net profit for the first seven      months came to about $6,200! Had I not read the article in      your magazine, I'd still be worrying about how to make an      income and, at the same time, have fun doing it. Thank you,      MOTHER, for giving me the inspiration I needed to get      going.<br />      <br />      J.M.<br />      Oregon<br />      <br />      Our city yard is approximately 30' X 50', including the      driveway and sidewalks. The previous owners had planted two      sweet gum trees in this space . . . and though they were      beautiful, healthy, and well shaped, they were already 25      feet tall with the prospect of reaching 130 to 180 feet at      maturity! We had to cut one down a while back, when we      redid the driveway, but we still had its mate, which was      rapidly becoming too large for the yard.<br />      <br />      When I called a local tree nursery and told them I had a      sweet gum tree that needed to be removed from my yard, they      immediately told me it would cost $200 to cut it down. I      then asked if they had the equipment to take the tree      alive. When the owner replied that he did, I told him my      plan: Remove the tree, fill in the hole, resod it, and      plant a 10- to 15-foot scrub oak, all at no cost to me, in      exchange for the sweet gum, which had a retail value of      $2,400.    </p>        <p>      The nurseryman thought this over for a few days and then      agreed to my proposed swap. After winter put the tree in      its dormant stage, his crew showed up with shovels and a      crane on a flatbed truck. Three days-and a larger      crane-later, they hauled the tree away, photographing      the whole procedure, since they had never removed such a      large tree before.<br />      <br />      The sweet gum is now on display in front of their business,      and my little oak produced its first acorns this      year.<br />      <br />      S.G.<br />      Oklahoma    </p>        <p>      My dad subscribes to your magazine, and I really enjoy it .      . . especially The Weird Humor of Jack Vaughan, Down on the      Farm, and Successful Swaps.<br />      <br />      I have one exceptionally neat swapping story to tell you. I      started bartering marbles when I was 11 years old and      living in Rwanda. One day at school, a friend of mine      wanted to play marbles, but he didn't have any. I offered      to trade seven of my marbles for his pen. However, when we      returned to class, he needed his pen and wanted to exchange      again. I really didn't want to, but when he offered me a      French dictionary for the pen, I couldn't refuse!<br />      <br />      I love your magazine!<br />      <br />      N.P.<br />      Tunis, Africa    </p>
