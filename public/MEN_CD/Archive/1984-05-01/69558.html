                <p>      <em>Even if you're not an accomplished carpenter, you can      build a home gym. . .for less than $200!</em>    </p>        <h2 id="subtitle">      Fitness Center    </h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Carlos DeJesus    </h5>        <p>      I'm an athlete <em>-</em> a competing bodybuilder      <em>-</em> and a few years ago I was faced with a      problem. In order to train for competition, I needed ready      access to bodybuilding equipment for six days a week. And      though I was working out at a nice spa that featured      quality equipment, I couldn't get enough time on the      machines. The establishment was always crowded, and it was      closed on weekends and holidays. As memberships increased,      so did interruptions. The whole situation soon became      annoying enough to send me in search of a solution.<br />      <br />      A private gym seemed the perfect arrangement. Of course,      like most people, I couldn't afford to invest the $2,000      required to <em>buy</em> the heavy-duty equipment I needed.      I considered constructing my own metal gym, which would      have cost half as much as buying commercial equipment. But      even that plan demanded more cash than I could      afford.<br />      <br />      <strong>A UNIQUE SOLUTION<br /></strong>    </p>        <p>      After giving the problem a lot of thought, I decided to try      making my own fitness center out of wood . . . even though      I'd never seen any wooden gym equipment and wasn't much of      a carpenter! My first project was an adjustable bench. With      $15 worth of materials (including wood, screws, and glue),      my training partner, Rod Jackson, and I built the bench in      my living room . . . and were almost surprised when it      worked!<br />      <br />      That success inspired me to draw up plans for building what      my wife calls my "wooden gym". It contains a total of eight      pieces, ranging from a pulley machine to a curling bench      for the arms, and machines to exercise the legs. Though      made of wood, the equipment that Rod and I built is      designed to function as the expensive metal machines do.      People are always amazed when they see the gym . . . and      some have traveled 250 miles just to take a look!<br />      <br />      <strong>PROVEN SUCCESS<br /></strong>    </p>        <p>      With the help of this equipment, I won the 1980 Virginia      State Physique Championships (Mr. Old Dominion) ... the      1981 United States Physique Championships (Mr. U.S.A.) . .      . and the 1981 North American Physique Championships (Mr.      North America) <em>-</em> all in little over a year!      Then, in 1982, Rod won the title of Mr. U.S.A., as well.      You can see, then, that the gym has worked quite well for      us!    </p>    		        <p>      Our total investment in our home fitness center (a dream      come true for any bodybuilder!) was approximately $192.      Keeping the cost down did involve a little improvising. For      example, the cable and pulleys we used for the "lat"      machine were salvaged from a wrecked aircraft at no cost. I      think, however, that any resourceful builder could manage      to spend as little as we did. If, like us, you can buy pipe      at a junkyard, do it! The materials don't have to be      new.<br />      <br />      It is necessary, however, to select unwarped wood that's      free of knots, splits, or other damage that would weaken      it. Cut the pieces, then drill the holes for the pipes and      bolts before you assemble the equipment. And, to avoid      splitting the wood, connect the pieces with screws instead      of nails. (I used No. 10 X 23/4" screws.) I also found that      drilling a small pilot hole eases the task of putting in      the screws, and that applying Elmer's Carpenters' Glue to      the joints before assembly makes for a sturdier bond.      Additionally, you should be sure that the wood is clean,      smooth, and free of rough edges before you paint it.<br />      <br />      Finally, padding is needed on those parts of the gym that      will come in contact with the body, but that material      doesn't have to be expensive either. I used old carpet tied      into place with string.    </p>            <p>      <strong>LONG-TERM SATISFACTION</strong><br />      <br />      We've enjoyed the comfort and convenience of our own      private gym for more than three years now. We don't pay      dues to spas . . . we no longer wait in line to use the      equipment . . . and we train whenever we want to.<br />      <br />      My next challenge will be the Mr. Universe Contest. I'm      just wondering if anyone there will believe that I trained      on gym equipment made of wood!<br />      <br />      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: The two plans presented here are      excerpted from Carlos DeJesus' booklet describing his      entire gym. We were impressed enough with the equipment      that in our upcoming July/August issue we're going to show      you the designs for six more of the author's wooden workout      machines, including a calf block; a curling bench; and      hyperextension, "lat" standing calf, and seated calf      equipment. Should you want more information on Mr. Dejesus'      Wooden Gym booklet, his Natural Instinctive Training      manual, or the natural bodybuilding school he's founded,      you can contact him at The School of Natural Bodybuilding,      1822 Williamsburg Rd., Suite 10, Richmond, VA 23231.</em>    </p>

The weight rack fastened to the head of the bench is not Carlos DeJesus' design, but is one of several possible methods of supporting the weight bar on this machine between pressing repetitions.
