                    <p>      <em>If you tell the truth once, they will never believe you      again, no matter how much you lie.</em><br />      <br />      Well sir, not everyone kin breed a prize foxhound, put      themself through med-ee-cal school, or win a tellervision      sweepstakes. And that's where <em>gardenin'</em> comes in.      You see, people may <em>tell</em> you they grow all them      vegetables and flowers because they love the beauty of      green livin' things . . . savor the savin's at the      supermarket . . . or go for the sweet, full flavor of      homegrown produce. But jist get more'n one of those      backyard bean pickers in one room an' listen to 'em for a      minute to hear the kinds of things they say to each      other:<br />      <br />      "What? You <em>don't</em> have any ripe tomatoes      yet?"<br />      <br />      "I'm goin' to have to stop freezing corn or buy a new      freezer, one or t'other."<br />      <br />      "You know, I kinda hated to cut into that lovely 32-pound      watermelon we grew."<br />      <br />      That's right, gardenin' gives 'em something to      <em>brag</em> about! Now I admit, folks what raise good      crops <em>do</em> deserve a little bit of opportunity for      mouthing off. Tearing up that ground, hoeing out weeds,      outfoxing insect prederters - it's all <em>hard</em>      work. But that's precisely where the of reprobates of the      Plumtree Crossing Truth an' Veracity League have it all      over the ordinary achin'-backed weed puller. Those boys      have pruned away all the nonessential tasks of gardenin'      so's they can better appreciate its <em>true</em>      purpose.<br />      <br />      Take the other day, for instance. Last Saturday was one of      them warm, dry, sunshine days . . . perfect for toiling      away in the vegetable patch. An' sure enough, whilst all      ordinary vegetable growers were workin' up sweats sowing      rows of Greasy Cut Short green beans or haulin' loads of      fresh manure from farmers' feedlots (and <em>payin'</em>      fer the privilege!), the members of Plumtree's Greater      Civic Horticultural League was all stretched out on the      front porch of the General Store, enjoyin' the warm      sunshine the way it was meant to be enjoyed, an' doin'      their own special brand of <em>low-labor</em>      gardenin'.<br />      <br />      "Well, Cleedy, you plantin' beans today?" Skeeter Ridges      set forth . . . a question which, to the      <em>uninitiated</em> , might seem a bit peculiar. After      all, Mr. McCannon was leanin' back in his chair with his      straw hat so far over his face that only a long blade of      chewin' grass poked out underneath. He didn't really      <em>look</em> like he was in a laborin' mood.<br />      <br />      "Nope," Cleedy replied. "It's the wrong kind of weather.      I'm waitin' till it rains." "Till it rains?"<br />      <br />      Skeeter said, doin' his bit to get things started.<br />      <br />      "Yep. Right before a big of bundle of black clouds cuts      loose, I'll load my shotgun with all the bean seeds I got,      stand in the middle of my plot, point that gun straight up      in the air, pull the trigger an' - kerplooey! -      plant my garden! That rain'll pack all my seeds in the      ground an' water 'em at the same time!"<br />      <br />      "Aw, <em>plantin'</em> ain't the hard part of gardenin',"      Lafe Higgins broke in. "It's gettin' that ground all turned      up in the first place. I don't care how you do it -      with a machine, a horse, or a shovel - that's one      aggravatin' task. Unless . . ." His voice trailed off      enticingly.<br />      <br />      "Unless <em>what</em> ?" young Billy Parsons jumped      in.<br />      <br />      "Why, unless you bury a silver dollar out in the garden, of      course."<br />      <br />      "A silver dollar?"<br />      <br />      "Fer certain," said Lafe. "Then you gather up all the      young'uns you can find an' tell 'em that the one who      uncovers that dollar gets to keep it. Those kids'll dig      that plot up from top to bottom! In point of fact, you kin      flat <em>guarantee</em> that the job'll get done      thorough-like if you <em>forgit</em> to bury that      coin!"<br />      <br />      "Aw, shucks," Lem Tucker contributed in a cultivated tone.      "Tillin' and plantin' ain't so bad. You only have to do      those things once. It's all that <em>weeding</em> that'll      get to a fella. Why, those one-legged garden invaders jist      never <em>stop</em> growin'. It gets so everytime you turn      your back, they've shot up another foot. In my patch, the      groundhogs used to have to climb six feet up the weeds to      get high enough so they could look for the crops!"<br />      <br />      " <em>Used</em> to?" Lafe and Cleedy both prompted.<br />      <br />      "That's right, used to. Then I trained Juniper, my beagle,      to chase weeds. That dog'd come racin' down toward the      garden, yipping and a-yapping like she were fit to bust an'      with her teeth flared out like a wild boar's tusks. Why,      the weeds'd git so scared, they'd pull up their roots an'      run clear out of the vegetable patch! Yep, of Juniper kept      my garden clean as a preacher's cuss words while she      lasted."<br />      <br />      "What happened?"<br />      <br />      "One hot day last August, that beagle got a little too      uppity an' tried to run off a multiflora rose bush that      growed along the fence at the edge of my plot.      <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: In case you've had the pleasure of</em>      <em>not making multiflora rose's acquaintance, take our      word for it. It's the most briary, ker-tangly,      skin-snaggling wild thorn bush there ever was.]</em> Well,      that patch of devil's whiskers got aholt of my dog an'      shredded her up so badly that when I come out to look for      her . . . all I could find was strips of dried jerky      hanging on the bush!"<br />      <br />      "The way I figger it," Purvis Jacobs pointed up, "is that      if you give your plants the right sort of stimmy-lation      they'll <em>outgrow</em> the weeds. So one year I brewed      some high-potency manure tea by runnin' that foul-smelling      juice through my still. I fed that three-digit-proof      fertilizer to all my corn plants an' - jist like that      - they grew faster'n interest rates after election      day. The plants did have a funny tendency to sway back an'      forth a lot, though . . . like they had <em>trouble</em>      keeping theyselves up."<br />      <br />      "How'd the ears taste?" Lem asked.<br />      <br />      "You know, I never did find out. The night before I was      going to pick 'em all, I got woke up by the loudest      squealing an' caterwauling an' carrying on since Noah      loaded the Ark. I snuck down to the garden to see what was      causing the fuss an' saw a sight rarer'n leftover whiskey.      Raccoons had eaten all my ripe corn and gotten theyselves      so drunk they'd hired in a frog band an' was havin' a      hoedown!"<br />      <br />      "Speaking of music," Doc Thromberg chimed in, "that's what      I use to help my crops grow. It all started when I read      that plants do better if they git to <em>listen</em> to      some good music now and again. I borrowed my      brother-in-law's fiddle, and every night I'd go out there      with that thing an' scratch out a tune as best I could. I      noticed after a week or so, though, that my beginner's      efforts seemed to be <em>stuntin'</em> my plants instead of      helpin' 'em.<br />      <br />      "When I made my diagnosis - it was a clear case of      Turkey-in-theStraw phobia - I knew jist what to do. I      went out the next night an' told those plants that if they      didn't start growin' better, I'd keep on playin'! Well,      they shot up so far after that I never had to break out      that fiddle again."<br />      <br />      "Well, ya'll can say all you want about tillin', plantin',      weedin', or encouragin' your crops," Newt Blanchard      remarked dryly. "Ain't none of them mean nothin' to the      labor of <em>puttin' up</em> all the pickin'! I tell you,      one summer twenty years ago, I swore I wasn't never goin'      to can another tomato as long as I lived. I've kept my      promise, too."<br />      <br />      "How'd you manage that?" Doc asked.<br />      <br />      "Well, I decided to <em>breed</em> me a new kind of tomato.      I jist stuck me a jar of canned 'maters in the ground the      next spring, kept it watered, an' waited for a plant to      shoot up. Afore long it did. Grew good an' tall, too. When      the vine's flowers bloomed, they sprouted little bitty      glass jars at their ends that slowly got bigger an' bigger.      After a few days, they stopped growin' an' started fillin'      themselves up with ripe, cooked tomatoes. When each jar was      packed to the rim, I jist picked it off the vine an' put it      away on my pantry shelf!"<br />      <br />      With that topper, all the fellas figgered they'd done      enough work for one day. So they ordered up a round of Moon      Pies and Nehi Sodas an' then stretched out in their porch      chairs for an afternoon siesta.<br />      <br />      No sir, some folks do an awful lot of sweatin' an' laborin'      in their vegetable plots, just to have somethin' worthwhile      to talk about. Not our boys of the Plumtree Crossing      General Assembly, though. Long ago, they figgered out the      truly <em>efficient</em> way to enjoy the <em>real</em>      benefits of home gardenin'.    </p>    <p>      To own a bit of ground, to scratch it with a hoe, to plant      seeds, and watch the renewal of life - this is the      commonest delight of the race, the most satisfying thing a      man can do.<br />      <br />      - Charles Dudley Warner<br />    </p>
