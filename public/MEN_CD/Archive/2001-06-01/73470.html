        <p>I have discovered that bike inner tubes can enjoy a useful second life as utility straps. They can be easily sized - cut into shorter pieces or looped together for length - and are great for tying down just about anything.</p><p>I always keep a few in the trunk of my car because they come in handy for securing things to the top. I use smaller pieces to stake vines in my garden and vineyard. In winter, the inner tubes are large enough to manipulate with gloves on, and they're not hampered by the cold.</p><p>If you don't have a bunch of them lying around your garage already, you can get used ones free from any bike repair shop.</p><p>G.
