                    <p>      <strong>Western poison oak</strong> <em>(Toxicodendron      diversilobum)</em>    </p>    <p>      Considered the poison oak by some botanists, this plants is      common on the Pacific Coast (except for the Olympic      Peninsula) from southern British Columbia to northern Baja      California. Its three leaflets seem randomly lobed and      resemble oak leaves. Most often found as a spreading,      freestanding shrub two to six feet tall, Western poison oak      can also take the form of a tall, climbing vine.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Eastern poison oak</strong> <em>(Toxicodendron      toxicarium; also T. quercifolium)</em>    </p>    <p>      Unlike poison ivy, this low shrub never climbs or produces      aerial rootlets. It grows in poor, sandy soils such as      those of oak-pine savannas in the Atlantic and Gulf coastal      plains and in scrub oak forests in Arkansas and Missouri.      The plant's three leaflets are distinctly roundlobed and      resemble the leaves of the common, nontoxic white oak tree.      Eastern poison oak berries are white and are borne in      clusters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Poison sumac</strong> <em>(Toxicodendron      vernix)</em>    </p>    <p>      This tall shrub prefers low, damp, swampy places and may      grow to 15 feet. Like its nonpoisonous sumac cousins, it      has compound leaves with multiple leaflets, but there the      similarities end. Poison sumac leaves generally have seven      to 13 smooth-edged leaflets; nonpoisonous sumac leaves have      11 to 31 toothed leaflets. Poison sumac yields pale-yellow      or cream-colored berries that hang in drooping bunches;      nonpoisonous species produce upright, conical clusters of      red fruit in typical "staghorn" fashion. Poison sumac is      closely related to the Asiatic lacquer tree, and it is      sometimes known as "poison dogwood."    </p>        <p>      <strong>Common poison ivy</strong> <em>(Toxicodendron      radicans)</em>    </p>    <p>      Poison ivy is found throughout the U.S., except for some      desert areas, as well as much of Canada and Mexico. It can      be a shrub, ground cover or woody vine covered with hairy      aerial rootlets. Generally, in Eastern states the plant's      three leaflets are smooth-edged, while varieties in Central      and Southeastern regions have notched or toothed leaflets.      Some Western varieties have a distinct lobe or "thumb" on      one or both sides of each leaflet. In spring, young leaves      often appear glossy and reddish but then turn dull green.      Emergence of foliage is followed by greenish white to pale      yellow flowers that later yield clusters of small,      yellowish-to-white berries.    </p>
