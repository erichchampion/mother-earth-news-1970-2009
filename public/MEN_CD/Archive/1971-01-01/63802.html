                    <h5 id="byline">     by SUZANNA S. MACDONALD    </h5>        <p>      Putting aside any crass status motives, a fur coat is still      one of the most practical possible forms of winter wear.      Fur is windproof, waterproof and warm. It's also luxurious,      sensuous and gives a lovely feeling to the wearer. What's      more if you've been dreaming of a fur coat but you don't      want to endanger any of our fellow mammals now scurrying      around, you can have your cozy winterwear while doing the      planet an ecological favor by recycling someone else's old,      cast-off garment of 20 or more years ago for, possibly,      that many more seasons' use.    </p>    <p>      Our hunting ground will be the second hand store, the      Goodwill, the Salvation Army and rummage sales. If we're      lucky we'll find our pelts made up into one or more of      those big shouldered, Iona, flopping coats of the 40's and      50's. This is our raw material. We'll rip the old apart and      make new.    </p>    <h3>PATTERN</h3><p>      Think about design (coat? cape? jacket?) and choose your      heart's delight with one thought uppermost in mind:      Simplicity. You'll be learning on this first venture. Keep      it simple with a minimum of darts and details. Make a      sketch of each pattern piece and indicate the required      measurements. Take this information and a tape measure with      you when you look for pelts so you'll be sure to pick a      cast-off garment large enough to remake into your design.    </p>    <h3>PELTS</h3><p>      Remember now: You're buying your fur already sewn into a      hulking, swirling coat 20 or 30 years old. The raw material      will be worn, torn . . . and inexpensive. Choose carefully      and creatively. It takes imagination to <em>see</em> your      coat in that sad old heap of beaver, seal or mink.    </p>    <p>      Most important is the suppleness of the pelts. Try to get      inside the lining to see their back sides. If they're      crackly or thin or weak, look for something else. The      natural oils have probably dried out and the pelts will      disintegrate as you're working on them. By the way,      shorthaired furs are easier to work than longhaired ones.    </p>    <p>      Pick the coats up. Are they heavy or light in weight? The      lighter the fur, the less poundage you'll be carrying on      your shoulders. (Have you noticed? The heavier a garment,      the quicker you get sick and tired of it.)    </p>    <p>      Check for bare and worn spots. Probably the front lapels,      sleeve cuffs and neck edge will show the most wear but you      can plan your pattern placement to avoid these areas. You      won't be so lucky if the lower back, elbows and places      where women wear their purses look tacky and flat. You'll      have to incorporate such areas into your pattern and      they'll look just as bad on the new coat.    </p>    <h3>MISCELLANEOUS MATERIALS</h3><p>      The other major ingredient you'll need for this recycling      project is <em>taffeta</em> or <em>satin linin</em>      <em>g</em> <em>.</em> If you're a genuine bargain hunter,      you'll pick this up for pennies at a remnant sale.    </p>    <p>      You'll also want, enough <em>twill tape</em> to face the      raw edges of the fur, <em>strong waxed thread ,</em> a      <em>seam ripper, thimble, tape</em> or <em>tailor's chalk,      sharp needles</em> and a <em>razor</em> <em>blade</em>      <em>.</em>    </p>    <h3>DIRECTIONS</h3><p>      (1) Cautiously separate fur from the old lining, tapes and      padding with a seam ripper. You'll need to open all main      seams: Shoulder, side, sleeve, etc. As you work, you can      learn a great deal about handling fur if you'll note how      the furrier sewed his seams, how he padded areas and      attached linings. His knowledge is there, study it.    </p>    <p>      A WARNING! If, after opening the first three inches of      seam, you find queer flakes and grains sifting out (and      they look like the stuff that was in the wormy brown rice      last summer), don't heave out the coat in queasy panic.      It's only the sawdust or cornmeal that cleaners use to      clean furs.    </p>    <p>      (2) Spread out the pieces on your work table, pile side      down. They should all lay flat. If one doesn't it's      probably because of a dart, which complicates things. Maybe      you can keep the dart in for added fit. If not, open it and      piece the fur. If the piece is well matched, it will be      invisible from the fur side.    </p>    <p>      (3) Now, cut the lining and pelts to the pattern. Cut the      pieces of the lining first. They will need seam allowances.      The sections of fur will not, so after the lining is cut,      remove the seam allowances from the pattern before cutting      the pelts. Use tape or mark with tailor's chalk.    </p>    <p>      ANOTHER WARNING! Fur has a nap which runs down. From neck      to hem, from shoulder to wrist. Always, always, down! So      there'll be no turning the pattern pieces every which way      to make them fit when cutting the pelts. If you try that,      the fur on your finished masterpiece will run      helter-skelter and the coat will look ghastly.    </p>    <p>      (4) Use a razor blade to cut the fur. Cut only the pelt and      carefully separate the uncut fur with your fingers so that      none of the pile is damaged.    </p>    <p>      (5) Sew the fur together with whipping stitches. Use a      sharp needle, a thimble and strong waxed thread. This job      will seem to take forever if you use small, neat stitches      and catch only the pelt and not the pile. If it isn't      taking forever, you're being sloppy and-in a few      months-a seam will pop. It will be the mending of      these poor seams, in that case, that will take forever.    </p>    <p>      (6) Sew twill tape to the edges of the fur using the same      slow, patient stitches. Remember, the coat will last for      years if it is well sewn in the beginning.    </p>    <p>      (7) Construct lining. Press seams. Attach lining to twill      tape and hem it.    </p>    <p>      (8) Sew on hooks and eyes, snaps or frog closings and your      new winterwear is done! Take care of it. Shake out the      water when it gets wet and always hang the coat on a      sturdy, padded hangar.    </p>        <p>      Once you get the knack of handling pelts, you won't have      GRAVE DOUBTS about lack of experience and you can tackle      those other furry dreams: A parka? Hats? Muffs? How about a      quilt from all the scraps you'll have left over? Or      puppets? A fur-covered chair? A fur-lined cloth coat? Be      creative! Recycle those tattered and torn secondhand store      treasures into practical garments and accessories. It will,      admittedly, cost you a big hunk of time . . . but very      little cash.    </p>    <p>      One last thought. Recycling old furs is inexpensive, lots      of fun and yet another way of stretching the dwindling      resources of Spaceship Earth . . . but new pelts? Be a      hypocrite about fur! Protest the killing of endangered      species! Fight it every way you can. Maybe, someday, the      only new furs used by man will be from animals that die a      natural death.    </p>
