                <p>      There are those who argue-sometimes with good      reason-that the whole concept of running off to      distant lands to "convert the heathen" has created far more      suffering than joy in the world. Maybe so, maybe not. But      no matter what you, personally, may think about the      <em>message</em> carried by missionaries . . . it might pay      you to take a closer look at some of the low-cost living      and survival methods pioneered and employed by various      members of the breed.    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">		by David Wilcox		</h5>      <p>      If you wanted someone to teach you homesteading skills,      would you think of asking a missionary? Probably not . . .      yet if he'd ever served in a remote part of the world, such      an evangelist might be a very good instructor. After all,      long before the back-to-the-land movement got started, many      dedicated men and women of various faiths were already old      hands at setting up housekeeping with scanty supplies,      local resources and their own ingenuity.    </p>    <p>      Though some ministers abroad now enjoy modern facilities      and equipment, the "do it yourself" tradition is      still-necessarily-very much alive at New Tribes      Mission . . . a nondenominational, evangelical Protestant      foundation. The 900 NTM field workers specialize in      carrying the Gospel to the most primitive peoples in the      wilds of New Guinea, South America, Africa and the      Philippines. Their work, in fact, is so demanding that New      Tribes' five "boot camps" (in Pennsylvania, Florida, Canada      and Wisconsin) teach the apprentice missionary basic      skills, not only of ministry, but of survival.    </p>        <p>      An essential part of this training-"jungle      camp"-takes place every spring when each NTM student      goes out into the woods near the school and begins to build      the house in which he and his family will live for a period      of one to two months.    </p>    <p>      During the several weeks it usually takes to clear a site      and erect a shelter, the missionary trainee tries as much      as possible to simulate jungle conditions and to do as he      will have to do when he finds himself actually living with      a native tribe far from "civilization". Since it's very      difficult to send building supplies to the interior areas      where the new evangelist will be working, he knows that      he'll probably have to make do with what's available. This      means, for one thing, that if the missionary and his family      want to cook and bake on something more advanced than an      open fire, they must learn during the training period to      build what they can with what they have: earth and stone      and what grows.    </p>    <p>      Here, then, is the type of stove that New Tribes trainees      have found most practical . . . a design that's well suited      to homesteading in the boondocks because it can be built      quite readily from materials at hand wherever you are.    </p>    <p>      The first step in the construction of the primitive      "kitchen range" is the fabrication of a platform to raise      the cooking area to a convenient working height. Usually      this is done by driving short poles into the ground and      tying crosspieces to the uprights with a generous amount of      baling twine. The result is a sort of table-like affair      which is topped with stout branches to serve as a base for      the stove.    </p>        <p>      Next, construct a three-sided stone or brick box-open      at one end-to hold the fire. To do this, place a      covering of stone on the raised platform and cement the      rocks together with clay or mortar (keeping the surface as      smooth as possible so that the stove will be easier to      clean). Then build up the sides of the firebox as you'd      construct a wall, and seal all the chinks. Finally, cover      the top of this box, for about two-thirds of its length      nearest the fuel entrance, with a flat plate (preferably of      cast iron, but you can use steel or even stone).      <em>Remember, however, that only hard, unlayered rock will      do and the slab must be dried out by slow heating to      prevent it from bursting or even exploding when exposed to      intense heat.</em>    </p>    <p>      At the other end of the firebox-farthest from its      open end-you should next construct your stove's oven      around a five-gallon can. The container is supported at      front and back and room is left between its sides and the      stone or brickwork so that the smoke and hot gases can pass      on their way up to the chimney.    </p>    <p>      Though the can is satisfactory, a better way to build the      oven is to place a whole 16-gallon drum inside a 30-gallon      drum cut in half lengthwise. The larger barrel serves as a      form for the brick or stone and makes for a neater and      easier job.    </p>    <p>      The oven itself, of course, has to have one end fitted with      a door . . . a job that's most easily handled with an      oxyacetylene torch, though it can be done with hand tools.      Cut a square hole in the metal, make a cover that's about      an inch bigger all the way around and attach the closure to      the baking compartment . . . with hinges at the bottom so      the door can swing down out of the way. Finally, make or      buy a latch for the top of the door.    </p>    <p>      The chimney-which consists of a pipe set into a hole      in the arch above the oven-must fit tightly and be      cemented in with clay or mortar. You'll also need to put a      damper in the pipe so that the draft (and hence the amount      of heat) can be controlled.    </p>    <p>      Of course, what I've described is just one possible form of      simple oven. The Indians of the Southwest, and other      peoples around the world, achieve the same results by      building a structure like a beehive of stone, with an      opening in the front near the bottom and a smoke hole at      the top. This chamber is heated through and through for a      couple of hours, the ashes are raked out and the device is      then ready to bake with the stored-up heat in its stone.      This form of oven is a little more awkward to use, but it      does work well. Although the Indian version is usually      built on the ground and therefore requires a lot of bending      over, I see no reason why it couldn't also be raised on a      platform to eliminate the stooping.    </p>    <p>      There you are . . . pick your style and go to it. And good      luck!    </p>    <p>      ±±±±±      ±±±±±±      ±±±±±<br />    </p>
