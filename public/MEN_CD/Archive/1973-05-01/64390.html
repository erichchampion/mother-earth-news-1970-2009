                        <p>      <strong>DOKUS CUDDY</strong>    </p>    <p>      The national heritage of many nations includes some      delicious form of flatbread: the Mexican tortilla, Italian      pizza chapati from India . . . and, here in northern      Minnesota, the descendants of Scandinavian settlers still      bake hardtack. While visiting a local farmhouse, John (my      husband) and I happened to sample some of that last      delicacy. We liked it so much that, as we left, our hostess      made us a gift of a whole bagful to take along. Although      our farm was only four miles away, the sack was empty by      the time we arrived home! Everyone I know who's tried this      nutritious fare acclaims it as THE super munchie.    </p>    <p>      Hardtack can be made with any combination of flours you      choose: corn, wheat, oats, barley, rice, rye or unbleached      white . . . but if you use a generous ratio of whole grain      flours the taste is sure to be delicious. Buttermilk,      yogurt, whey, cream and sweet or sour milk may be used      interchangeably as the necessary liquid, or you can try      mixing them.    </p>    <p>      The real art of making good, crunchy hardtack lies in      rolling the dough very thin. The traditional method is to      compound a stiff mixture, put some flour on a board and      then take a small lump of the blend and spread it out as      much as possible. Then comes the difficult part . . .      transferring the flimsy film to a cookie sheet. John      experimented with several batches and found that this last      step was just too hard to handle . . . so he eliminated it      altogether by simply rolling the dough out on the flat pan      in the first place.    </p>    <p>      Here, then, is the "new, improved" Cuddy method of making      hardtack: First, lightly grease and flour your baking      surface. Then take an egg-sized piece of dough (enough to      cover a 14" X 16" sheet when it is spread out), dust the      lump with flour to prevent sticking (repeat as necessary),      center the ball on the cookie sheet and squash it slightly      with your palm.    </p>    <p>      Now start flattening the mixture and think sheer! A flour      sock slipped over a rolling pin is the perfect tool to use      at this point, but-in a pinch-you can      substitute a cylindrical jai. With some practice, your      proficiency and speed at this baker's task will improve      tremendously. Trim off any excess dough and throw the      scraps back in your mixing bowl.    </p>    <p>      Bake the flatbread in a hot oven (around 400Â°). If you      have a wood stove, be careful until you get to know its      nature. The "loaf's" edges nearest the firebox may tend to      scorch if the hardtack is left too long. When the border      browns, flip the bread over and bake till it's almost      cardboard stiff. Turn your unleavened creation again and      wait this time until the thin slab <em>is</em> cardboard      stiff. Then remove the whole thing from the oven and      carefully lift the results of your labor off the sheet. Get      ready to stand back if there's anyone around with an      appetite! This treat can't be surpassed when it's hot and      fresh.    </p>    <p>      A recipe using about five cups of flour will yield at least      five batches. To store the hardtack, break it into pieces      and place them in a cannister, a tin container, a jar with      a cover or anything else that's airtight. This is one baked      goody that won't ever spoil as long as it remains dry.    </p>    <p>      Flatbread is an ideal provision for hiking or backpacking      because it is lightweight, compact and keeps well. You can      carry many days' supply with ease, and the crunchy morsels      are satisfying and sustaining. We use this food around the      homestead as both a staple and a snack. Eaten with butter,      cinnamon and sugar, cheese, sausage, nut butters,      preserves, etc., hardtack becomes the vehicle for whatever      taste trip you crave. And it's just as good all by itself.      I think we've discovered the closest thing to Tolkien's      Elfin Waybread!    </p>
