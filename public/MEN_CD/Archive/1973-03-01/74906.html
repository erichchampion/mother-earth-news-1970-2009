                    <p>      Back in MOTHER NO. 18 we brought you the best of what we      found while rummaging through some of the early farm      publications. Here then - repeated by popular demand      - are two more pages of that old-timey information      taken from issues of THE OHIO PRACTICAL FARMER dated 1884      to 1902.    </p>    <h3>A Farmer's Hotbed.</h3>    <p>      The methods of preparing and caring for a hot-bed are very      simple, and with a little forethought and care one should      have no trouble. The ordinary stock size of hot-bed sash,      carried in stock by dealers is 3x6 ft., but my old sash      will answer the purpose.    </p>        <p>      The hot-bed should be laid out to extend east and west, and      the north side of the frame should be about six inches      higher than the south side, to give the glass a pitch      toward the sun. Take a plank or board ten inches wide for      the front and one sixteen inches wide for the back is about      right. The ends of the frame should come up even with the      top of the side planks, and be ripped off to give the      proper pitch. A cleat should be nailed on the end of the      hot-bed shown at C, in Fig. 1, to (told the sash from      slipping endwise. The frame should also have it stay across      the top about every six feet to prevent the sides from      springing out; shown at A, Fig 1. About the 1st to 15th of      March, according to the earliness of spring preparations      should be made for the hot-bed. Select some sheltered spot      where there is plenty of sunshine and dig out a hole about      one foot larger than the frame on every side and about 2      1/2 feet deep. deep.    </p>    <p>      Draw out a load or two of fermenting horse manure. If the      manure is heating evenly .ill through it may be put into      the pit at once, if not it should be shaken up roroughly      and piled up in a close, compact pile arid left a few days.      If any portions of it are dry, it should be wet down. In      filling the pit, care should be taken to tread down the      manure firmly. The manure should extend beyond the frame on      all sides, one foot at least, then set on the frame and      bank it up on the outsides to the top of the frame with      manure.    </p>    <p>      Next put on six to eight inches of soil, put on the sash,      and let it sweat. By about the third or fourth day it will      do to sow to seed. Radishes, lettuce, and onion sets may be      put in along with cabbages, pepper and egg plants. The sash      should be raised a little everyday to give the plants fresh      air. When moisture begins to gather on the under side of      the glass you may know the temperature is running too high      and that, fresh air should be admitted. Care must be taken      not to allow cold wind to blow on the plants. In cold      nights the sash should be covered with straw matting or      burlaps, and in case of rain or snow it is well to have air      improved hot-bed shutter, the same size as the top of the      hot-bed. This shutter saves time and labor. To make it get      strips of 8/8-inch thick lumber, nail these onto cleats 7/8      in. x 2 in., at ends and middle, then take some building      paper and spread over the enthe surface, their fill and      pack the spaces with rye straw. Cover again with building      leaner slid nail on the boards on the under side. This      shutter takes the place of the ordinary board shutter and      straw mats and saves time in handling. Two iron handles,      like door handles, screwed on near each end, midway, help      handle it. One can do quite a business with a few hot-beds      of this kind.    </p>    <p>      -C. H. Hickox, Geauga Co., O.    </p>    <h3>TOMATOES.</h3>    <p>      Dig holes two feet deep, three feet apart, in rows four      feet apart. Put a peck of manure in each hole, chopping a      little rich dirt into the manure with the spade; then fill      in eight inches on this with rich earth, so as to bring it      up nearly even with the surface of the ground. Set a small,      thrifty plant in each hole, hill up with the hoe every week      until you have ridges along the line of plants, knee high,      and the tops begin to fall over; then clean out between the      ridges, drawing all the looser dirt up to the tops of the      ridges, leaving clean, bare trenches between. Place fence      rails across from one ridge to another, under the vines,      and upon these lay poles lengthwise with the rows, making a      scaffold for the vines to spread out on. A dozen plant, so      treated, will furnish a supply of tomatoes for a large      family until frost comes. Try it.    </p>    <p>      Big Clear Creek, W. Va. C. T. H.    </p>    <h3>How to Select Eggs for      Hatching.</h3>    <p>      It is a loss of tines and eggs to set a hen unless some      attention is given the selection of the eggs for that      purpose. When a lien becomes broody some take eggs from the      egg basket and place them in the nest with no regard to      their shape or size. There is no method of knowing if an      egg is fertile until the hens was warmed it for three or      four days.    </p>    <p>      In selecting eggs use no small or large eggs, but take      those of normal size running about eight to a pound. The      weight varies with the different breeds, however, Brown      Leghorn eggs are some lighter. Eight weighing 15 ounces.      Care should be taken that each egg selected is perfect in      its drape. Double yolk eggs; small, irregular shapes and      those which have excrescences on the shells should be      avoided. Extra large eggs are from hens that are not in      proper condition, while very small eggs may come from      immature pullets. Secure eggs front your inost prolific      hens. Attention to this matter may enable you to have a      better hatch.    </p>    <p>      -W. Hearn    </p>    <p>      Every FARMER should save his poultry manure for the garden,      if for no other purpose. Compost it with rich, dry soil, or      vegetable mold; pulverize it and put it in the dry.      Properly saved, it has four times as much nitrogen, more      than twice as much potash, and over four times, as much      phosphoric acid as horse manure. It can be used on all      garden crops, and will make it wonderful difference in the      yield amt quality of many of them.    </p>    <h3>CARP PONDS.</h3>    <p>      Carp ponds ought to be so constructed as allow the last      bucket of water to be draw off. The dam should be made of      clay that inclined to hold water. If the water is to be 4      or 5 feet deep, the dam must be 20 feet wide at the base, 8      feet at the top; if 10 feet deep, 30 feet wide at the base.      Where the dam is to stand, a ditch 4 feet wide must dug      down to solid bottom, the dam 2 feet higher than the water      is to be. A collect near the dam in the lowest place, one      foot deeper than the rest of the pond, 10 feet wide, from      10 to 30 feet long, according size of pond. Boards at the      sides and ends held together by stakes, for a cheap      sluiceway box; use plank 10 inches wide.Cut 1/2 inch deep      and 1 inch wide in the two sides. Planks cut across. Within      1 1/2 inch, cut 1/2 inch deep in the bottom plank. Now      measure 1 inch toward the end of the box; take a chisel,      cut it out beveling; cut with 1 1/2 inch of the edges. Use      inch board for slide board, 1 1/2 inch hole toward the top      pull out the slide board with lever power. At the inner end      of the sluiceway box drive in solid 4 stakes, 2 feet apart;      fix a board the bottom by nailing fast to stakes; slat the      sides and top, leaving a space between, every time, of      nearly 1/4 inch. This will let the water through, but not      the fish. For top outlet, cut a ditch somewhere in the      solid earth; across the ditch sink down a board plank or      sill nail on or frame in some posts to support the screen;      let the water run over. the plank. Stones may be put in the      ditch. The more shallow the water the better. Plenty of      grass is what carp must have for spawning. At present we      have three ponds the largest nearly four acres.    </p>    <p>      Morrow Co., O    </p>    <p>      A. BRENNEMAN    </p>      <h3>CHEAP RAIL FENCE.</h3>        <p>      C. A. P., of Blanchester, O., sends us a sketch and      description of a cheap rail fence he has in use. It is      shown in Fig. 1. He says: It can be made with about half      the rails required in an ordinary rail fence 9 rails high.      It is wind and stock proof, and no patent on it. I use      posts 5 feet long, set two feet, in ground. Place a ground      chunk close to the post. Let rails lap about one foot. Lay      first rail. Take a piece of oak 3 feet long, 1 x 2 inches      (split pieces;) set up close to the rail and wire it to      post; then lay up 4 or 5 rails high; their take pieces of      old rails, split out new ones 2 inches square and 5 1/2      feet long; set one on each side of fence so as cross on one      side of the post; put a wire around here; put on top rails      and wire stakes and rails as shown.    </p>    <h3>Filling the Silo.</h3>        <p>      VERY important item in filling the silo is to have      something to put in it,and to have it close by. The      inexperienced will probably not recognize the importance of      raising his silo crop close to the silo until after he has      tried it. Without entering into details, to tell how much      longer it takes to travel over a long road than a short      one, where so many trips must be taken as is the case in      filing the silo, we would simply say, if you have a nice      piece of ground for the silage crop away out there on the      further corner of the farm, dont plant, it there, even if      the ground and everything else is favorable. Plant      something else in it, and get your silage crop as close to      the silo as you can. Of course we can haul the silage crop      from a distance, but not unless we must.    </p>    <p>      Another pointer for the inexperienced is this: If you      calculate on using your long-coupled wagons and invite your      neighbors with their wagons to help you, then do not build      your silo in a corner where you cannot get to it. With our      short-turn tongueless trucks we can get into a corner arid      get out again, but the long-coupled wagon requires more      room. Besides, the engine and the cutter must also have      room and a place, and it may be that the mere mention of      this caution in the shape of a pointer to the beginner may      save him a lot of trouble, by getting his silo well located      so as to have it handy when he comes to fill it. Indeed,      this getting the silage in and out of the silo constitutes      a very important part of the whole ensilage business, and      unless there is ample provision made for getting the silage      in and out, there is danger of the extra labor consuming a      large part of the profit.    </p>    <p>      But it matters not how thorough and complete the      arrangements are, and how well the silo is located, and      all, unless we have something to put in it, all else avails      nothing. Corn is one of the surest crops we can raise, yet      even this sometimes fails, or nearly so, and our silo trust      go scantily filled. Last year our silo was filled to      overflowing; this year it is less than half full, and I      dare say some of my less fortunate friends have none. To      provide against the danger of dry and wet weather, the      ground should be well tiled, then plowed when it is in      order, and early. Nothing will do more to pulverize the      ground and make it fine and nice than to plow deep, with a      good plow, when the ground is in condition. Don't plow when      ground is hard; it will break up lumpy and stay lumpy all      season, and we shall have to be praying every day or two      for rain to keep our silo corn growing.    </p>    <p>      Few things are more detrimental to the silo crop than an      uneven stand. You can't do anything with it all season, and      when you come to fill the silo, half the corn will be too      ripe and half too green. It is a partial failure, at least,      the whole way through. Good deed is a very important item,      as a starter, at least, toward filling the silo. We plant      our corn in hills, both ways. We can cut it better, and      stir the ground better, in a dry season or wet. We plant it      close, 2 ft. 9 in.; it grows finer and more feed.    </p>                    <p>      We plant sweet corn-Scowell's Evergreen, than which      there is no better thing grown for the silo and for cows.      Good for the silo because it stays longest green until its      food elements become thoroughly ripened and at all times it      has more sap in it to carry it through the Beat of the      silo. It is good for the cow because it has more milk in it      and because site will not eat common corn if sire can get      sweet corn.    </p>    <p>      We want our corn to stand in the stalk just as long as it      can before the blades and trucks begin to get dry; then we      want it cut and stored directly in the silo, with all its      sap to help keep it. Besides the loss to the corn while      wilting in the open air, it is risky business cutting down      a field of corn the day before we want to fill the silo.      What if there should be a break in the machinery, or there      should cornea big rain, holes of which have happened to me      in the last two years. Just last year we had to pull out      and quit for one whole week before we could get back into      the field. You can imagine what my silage corn would have      been lying on the ground all that time.    </p>    <p>      In many country neighborhoods it is sill customary for      farmers to help each other. Where such help may be secured,      we drink better results may be obtained, because every man      does his best. In this section we must depend upon hired      help-take whom we can get, put up with ten hours for      a clay, and pretty short hours, too, at that, and a very      moderate speed of labor besides, so that it is not      surprising if we fail to secure such results as some of my      fellows who are willing to work 14 or 15 hours in order to      get the silo filled in a day.    </p>    <p>      Most of the silos that we read of are filled, according to      accounts, in a day. Now we would like to hear from somebody      that filled his silo in a week; Then we would feel more      like telling bow long it takes to fill ours. Large corn,      however hurdles and fills faster, while sweet corn is soft,      packs tighter, :rod requires more of it to fill fire same      space. -C. W. F., Findlay, O.    </p>   <h3> Value of Straw on the Farm.</h3>    <p>      The many purposes for which straw can be used make it a      valuable article on the farm and one deserving more      attention than many farmers see fit to give it. Where stock      is kept in the stable, a large amount can be used for      bedding, whites not only adds to the comfort of the      animals, but aids in saving the liquid manure, an item      which the farmer who has the welfare of his soil at heart      cannot overlook. It is also a source of pleasure, when one      is comfortably seated before the evening fire, to know that      the horse or cow in its stall can be comfortable on its bed      of straw.    </p>    <p>      With the use of a few rails or poles a goof hog shelter can      be made with straw. The hog should be kept dry and warm in      bad weather and it takes but a few hours to make it so with      plenty of straw at hand. Many a hog has suffered through      the cold winter blasts, within a few feet of a straw stack,      just because its owner did not take time to make it      comfortable. Again, many a rude hen house could be fixed      with straw, paying for the work many times in the increase      of eggs, to say nothing about value of protection to the      fowls.    </p>    <p>      Straw can also be used for feed to good advantage,      especially when cut fine and used in connection with bran,      shipstuff and ground feed.    </p>    <p>      -W. Jamison, Jeff. Co., Ind,    </p>
