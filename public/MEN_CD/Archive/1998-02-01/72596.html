            <p>      <strong>Garden and Yard Special</strong>    </p>        <p>      Fruit: rich, bloom dusted, melting, and luscious-      such are the treasures of orchard and garden..." wrote A.      J. Downing over a hundred years ago in <em>The Fruit and      Fruit</em> <em>Trees of North America</em> . When you raise      your own fruit, not only can you harvest at the peak of      perfection, but you also can grow fruits not commonly found      in the markets. Persimmon, pawpaw, june berry, gooseberry,      and red currant are examples of uncommon, yet delectable      fruits. They also are easy to grow, requiring neither the      repeated spraying nor the skillful pruning demanded by      apples, peaches, and other familiar fruits.    </p>        <p>      Persimmon. The botanical name <em>Diospyros</em>      appropriately translates as "food of the gods." Persimmons      have a soft, smooth, jelly-like texture, a honey-like      sweetness. In appearance, the fruits resemble tomatoes,      cherry tomatoes in the case of our native American      persimmon and large tomatoes in the case of the oriental      persimmon. American persimmon fruits are slightly drier and      richer in flavor than those of the oriental persimmon, the      persimmon sometimes found in markets. American persimmon      trees also survive and ripen their fruits further north.      American persimmon is hardy to -25°F; oriental      persimmon to 0°F.    </p>    <p>      Persimmons are not widely known or grown for their fruits      because they are too soft for commercial shipping-not      a problem when you stand under your own tree and eat the      fruits-and because unripe fruits are astringent: but      who would eat an unripe peach?. Contrary to myth, frost is      not necessary to ripen a persimmon, just a sufficiently      long season. I garden near the northern limit of persimmon      growing, so I grow an early ripening variety of American      persimmon, such as Meader, Pieper, and Szukis.    </p>    <p>      Many oriental persimmons do not need cross-pollination;      most American persimmons do. Trees of both types usually      have either male or female flowers, so if pollination is      needed, you must plant both a male and a female tree. There      is no danger of spring frost snuffing out the crop, because      the blossoms open relatively late in the season.    </p>        <p>      A long taproot makes persim mons more dif ficult to      transplant than most other fruit trees. Therefore, plant in      spring and use either potted trees or bare root trees that      have been freshly dug.    </p>    <p>      Young persimmon trees grow fast, then settle down to a      moderate growth rate as fruiting begins, eventually      reaching a height of about fifty feet. Young trees need      training so each main branch has sufficient space to      develop, but once bearing has commenced, the trees      naturally drop some branches that have fruited, so are      somewhat self-pruning. (In the March, 1982 issue of MOTHER,      we reported that planting wild mint around our persimmon      trees was an unexpected companion-planting discov ery.      Pests seemed to head for the high road once the mint was      established around the base. Our only dilemma was, and is,      keeping the mint from taking over the surrounding area once      we planted it. It's a ferocious spreader, but a ring of      rocks at the desired boundary seems to do the trick.)    </p>        <p>      P awpaw. I like to tell people that I have banana trees      growing in my backyard, even though winter temperatures      plummet to -30°F here. The trees are actually pawpaws,      but they have been known as Hoosier or Michigan      bananas-the tree is native to most of eastern      U.S.-because the fruits have a taste and texture      somewhat like a banana, with additional flavor hints of      vanilla custard, pineapple, and mango. The fruits ripen in      late summer or early fall.    </p>    <p>      Like persimmon, pawpaw has a long taproot, and must be      transplanted similarly. Plant two pawpaws, because the      lurid, purple flowers need cross pollination in order to      set fruit. The trees need little pruning, only enough to      remove dead or interfering branches and to stimulate some      new growth each year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gooseberry and Red Currant.</strong> These are      fruits that Europeans rave about, but which are practically      unknown in America. This is not surprising since mostly      inferior gooseberry varieties are sold here, and the fruits      usually are picked unripe for cooking.    </p>    <p>      But pop a fresh, ripe Whitesmith, Hinnonmakis Yellow, or      Achilles gooseberry into your mouth and you will taste why      the best gooseberries have been compared to the best grapes      in flavor. In seventeenth-century England, gooseberries      were even raised commercially for fermenting into wine.      Among the varieties in my garden are gooseberries that are      green, white, yellow, red, and purple, with some fruits as      large as small plums.    </p>        <p>      Red currants are known mostly for the beautiful jelly they      make, but I let mine hang on the bushes until they are dead      ripe and then eat them right out in the garden. The fresh      flavor is admittedly sprightly, but this is welcome during      the hot summer days during which currants ripen.    </p>    <p>      Red currants and gooseberries are borne on bushes growing      three feet high and wide. These are plants of the north:      they thrive where winter cold drops to -40°F but      languish in the hot summers of the South. For best      production, gooseberry and red currant bushes need annual      pruning. Each winter, I cut away at their bases any      branches older than four years old and all but a half-dozen      or so of the newest shoots growing up from ground level.      One shortcoming of the gooseberry is its stout thorns,      which necessitate picking fruits with at least one hand      gloved.    </p>    <p>      Juneberry. These fruits are blueberry-sized and dark blue,      so comparisons with blueberries seem unavoidable. In fact,      juneberries are juicy and sweet, with their own distinctive      flavor that is a bit almondy.    </p>    <p>      Also in contrast to blueberries, juneberries are not at C4      all finicky about soil and will I grow where winter lows      dip even to -40°f . There are many edible species of      juneber ry, so you can grow a plant the size of a low      shrub, a large shrub, or a small tree. Bus Bushy      juneberries benefit from annual winter pruning, but regular      pruning is not re quired for the tree forms. Unfortunately      juneberries are as popular with the birds as blueberries.      Guess what month the fruits ripen?    </p>    <p>      Hardy Kiwi. This fruit has the same sparkling, emerald      flesh as market kiwis (a relative), and the same      flavor-a savory mix of acidity and sweetness akin to      a dead-ripe pineapple. But hardy kiwis are the size of      grapes and have tender, smooth. It green skins and so can      be eaten whole, just like grapes. As implied by the name,      hardy kiwis laugh off cold, down to -30°F; market kiwis      tolerate only 0°. Fruits ripen in late summer and early      fall.    </p>        <p>      The plant is a vigorous twining vine that needs a pergola      or trellis over which to clamber. Allow 150 square feet per      plant. Prune the plants each year as you would grapes. A      more casual approach to pruning, with some sacrifice in      production, is to just lop back unruly branches.    </p>    <p>      Plants are either male or female, so to get fruit from a      female vine, you must also plant a male vine. This one male      can pollinate up to eight females. Some varieties such as      Issai do not need pollination. Young plants are less      cold-tolerant than mature plants, and sometimes are nipped      back to the ground unless protected with a wrapping of      burlap or straw.    </p>    <p>      Although persimmon, pawpaw, juneberry, gooseberry, and red      currant hail from the four corners of the world, none is      especially finicky as to site. The only condition all these      plants ador is waterlogged soil. Otherwise, any reasonably      fertile soil in full sun or even part shade will do. Since      these plants also are native to woodlands or cold climates,      they all also enjoy the cool, moist soil beneath a thick      mulch of leaves or straw.    </p>    <h3>Delicious and Beautiful</h3>    <p>      Many "uncommon" fruits are overlooked because they are      borne on ornamental trees, shrubs, and vines. Most      varieties of juneberry, for example, have been chosen for      their white or pink tinged flowers, or the fiery autumn      show of their leaves.    </p>    <p>      Hardy kiwis are attractive plants that have clothed      pergolas (see "MOTHER' Rustic Pergola" on page 62) on old      estates since the turn of the century-how many visitors      have passed beneath these pergolas, unaware of the      delicious fruits hidden among the leaves? Persimmons and      pawpaws have drooping leaves that give the trees a soft,      languid appearance in summer, livened in fall as the leaves      turn a clear yellow color. Even the bark of persimmon has a      pretty checked pattern.    </p>    <p>      Other plants with ornamental qualities and tasty fruits      include: cornelian cherry, a small tree clothed with yellow      blossoms in early spring; maypop, an herbaceous vine with      large, intricate, breathtaking flowers; lowbush blueberry,      a ground hugging shrub with nodding white blossoms in      spring, leaves that turn crimson in autumn, and stems that      remain reddish through winter.    </p>
