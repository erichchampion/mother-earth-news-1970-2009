                <p>      <em><strong>You might not be able to buy these tools at the      store, but you certainly can make them!</strong></em>    </p>    <p><strong>      BY STAFF PHOTOS</strong>    </p>        <p>      Harvesting wood is hard work . . . especially for the      occasional cutter who-like many of us-can't      justify the purchase of costly laborsaving equipment when      sawing only enough wood to keep the stove or fireplace      stocked. Yet properly designed hand tools, made from scrap      in your own modest workshop, can ease the burden of manual      labor while still doing a great job of keeping expenses in      check.    </p>    <p>      The three implements you see on these two pages were      adapted from Scandinavian designs and are well suited to      the type of secondary-growth cutting faced by most weekend      lumberjacks. Each tool cost less than $5.00 to build, and      only one-the pry bar peavey-required welding of      any kind. Read on and find out how you can spend a couple      of leisure hours to save a lot of time on the woodpile.    </p>    <h3>      THE LOG TONG    </h3>        <p>      Like the ice seller's tool, this device uses mechanical      advantage to keep a grip on the work . . . but its design      goes the old block tongs one better because it's meant to      be used with a single hand. Since the handle pivots on one      gaff' and is connected through links to the other, the      pressure of the "bite" is proportional to the weight of the      load.    </p>    <p>      To fashion a tong, first clamp two 11-1/2" sections of      3/16" X 1" flat stock together and drill a 5/16" hole      through each end of the matched set. Then join the pieces      with two short bolts, and-using our illustration as a      guide-bend the straps into the configuration shown.      (Yes, you're going to need a torch, a vise, locking pliers,      and a hammer to get the job done, but once you've heated      the metal to a dull red, it'll bend very easily and will      probably even have to be reflattened along the curves with      the hammer.)    </p>    <p>      Note that the completed tool has one long gaff with a      slight bend at its mounted end. Form this 1-1/2"-long      offset into both metal pieces; then, once everything has      air-cooled, remove the end bolts and use a hacksaw to cut      points on the tips and to trim the upper gaff to its 8"      finished length. Bevel the face of each point with a      grinder, then go on to round the nose and tail of each      "hook."    </p>        <p>      The handle should be formed, under heat, in the same manner      as the tongs were, then 3-1/2" of its forward end must be      flattened under blows from the hammer. Again, round the      nose of the completed part and smooth out the edges of its      opposite tip. Finally, cut the two scissor links from 1/8"      X 1" stock, finish their ends, and drill 5/16" holes      through both pieces at points 1-3/8" apart.    </p>    <p>      The remaining pivot holes should be drilled as follows: The      handle gets two, 1-3/4" apart . . . the top gaff, a pair      1-5/8" from each other . . . and the bottom gaff, another      two 1-11/16" apart, all measured from the center of the      openings. Once all the holes are bored, you can paint and      assemble the tool by tightening the nuts down to the shanks      and cutting off the threads that protrude. The handle and      top gaff fasten to one side of the bottom gaff, and the      links bolt to each side of those parts at their two forward      holes.    </p>    <h3>      PRY BAR PEAVEY    </h3>        <p>      This tool is essentially a felling lever with a few added      kinks. It has a spurred swing arm like that of a peavey,      and the shoe has a beveled tip and a sharpened side edge.      It's great for freeing chain saw bars bound in timber,      turning midsize logs, minor debarking, and-with the      sharpened flank-trimming twigs and small branches      prior to bucking.    </p>    <p>      Knock this one out by heating and then bending a 25°      angle into the 1" X 26" tubular steel handle about 7-1/2"      from one end. Then drill two 5/16" holes, 2-1/2" apart,      through the tube's opposite end so they're perpendicular to      the bend and the upper one is 3-1/4" from the closest tip.    </p>    <p>      Next, cut a 25° bevel in one end of a 3/4" X 7/8" X 8"      section of solid power takeoff shaft stock. Trim the 1/4" X      3" X 4-1/2" metal plate so one end tapers to a 1-3/8" width      (the angled sides should be about 1- 1/2" long), then weld      this newly made shoe to the diagonally cut end of the bar      stock so the tapered end comes flush with the rear of the      bevel.    </p>    <p>      To make the swing arm, clamp and endbolt the two 10-1/2"      sections of 3/16" X 1" flat stock together, and, with the      help of the torch, bend them as one so there's a 45°      crook in the center. Once they've cooled, cut the bolt      holes from one end and smooth the tips with the grinder.    </p>    <p>      The swing arm spur can be fashioned with a hacksaw and the      grinding stone from a piece of 1/4" stock, as can the      1-1/4"-sided, 21/2"base triangular spur guard. Similarly,      the two shoulders that support the spur itself can be made      from 3/8"-thick material. Temporarily bolt the swing arm      sections, bends up, into the uppermost hole in the handle.      Then weld a spur shoulder to the inside forward edge of      each swing arm, and the spur itself to the two shoulders so      the point meets the straight portion of the handle at      approximately 45° . . . making certain the arms are      parallel with one another as you do so. The guard can then      be welded just below the spur and in line with it.    </p>        <p>      Remove the swing arm assembly and tap the shoe and its post      into the straight end of the handle. Cross-drill the solid      piece at the handle holes, then lock it in place with the      two 5/16" bolts, seeing to it that the swing arm assembly      is refastened and allowed to move freely. (To prevent it      from flopping when not in use, simply pinch the bars a bit      closer together at the spur end so they'll bind on the      handle when the arm is pushed all the way back.)    </p>    <p>      With that done, you can sharpen the working edges. The      front of the shoe should be heated to an orange-red and      hammered against metal until the upper face is beveled to      about 25° and the edges splay outward. Then the left      side (if you're right-handed) can be ground to a 30°      bevel, trued on a coarse stone, and honed on its top and      bottom surfaces. The spur should be angled to 30° on      each side and the tip filed to a sharp point. Finally, if      you wish, you can wrap friction tape around the hand grip,      cap the end with a furniture tip, and paint the rest of the      implement.    </p>    <h3>      SAFETY HELMET    </h3>        <p>      Though some may not consider it a tool, this piece of      headgear offers protection against falling limbs and      branches, flying debris, and the potentially damaging      staccato noise of a chain saw engine hard at work.    </p>    <p>      The basic helmet is nothing more than a motorcycle "brain      bucket" that we picked up at a flea market for $3.00. The      only prerequisites for a good find are that it be in one      piece, fit comfortably, and have a functional chin strap      and snap studs at the front.    </p>    <p>      Essentially, you'll just be adding a screened visor and      some sections of cloth. Locate a piece of 18- to 20-gauge      sheet metal that measures at least 8" X 15", then use      aviation snips to cut it into strips of the sizes called      for in our illustration. Next, cut some sturdy wire cloth      (metal door screening will do) to 6" X 13-1/2" dimensions,      and lay it on the visor frame pieces so you can mark the      bends in the bottom and side sections.    </p>        <p>      Crease the frame parts by hammering them over a hard lip      (such as a metal plate or a workbench), then slip the      screen under the folds and tap them down. Use a flat-nosed      punch to dimple the folds every inch or so from the back      side. Lay the header in place, then drill 1/4" holes at the      frame's four corners to hold the fastening bolts. (The      completed perimeter should measure 6-1/4" X 14-1/2".) To      secure the top part of the screen and the cloth visor      skirt, fold an inch or so of the fabric over and capture it      and the wire cloth between the metal header liner and the      header, locking the two strips together with the shorter      blind rivets.    </p>    <p>      Complete the visor by bending two 1" tabs into the ends of      the visor clamp bar, then forming that strip to match the      contour of the front of the helmet. Attach three of the      snap fastener caps to the bar-in line with their      mates already on the helmet-with the No. 6 screws.      Next, put the No. 12 screws in place at the frame's lower      corners and bend the frame into an arc so you'll be able to      use the 1/4" bolts to fasten the clamp bar through the      upper corners. Snap the visor onto the helmet, then pop the      remaining two caps into the free corners of the skirt, and      screw the studs into the sides of the shell to hold the      caps. Finish up by riveting the nape skirt to the rear edge      of the helmet and painting the visor and fiberglass shell      the colors of your choice.    </p>
