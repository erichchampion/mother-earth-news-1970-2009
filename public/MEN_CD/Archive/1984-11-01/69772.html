            		<h5 id="byline">by Robert L. Williams</h5>		<p>During the holiday      season, many people take a step back to their childhoods      and return to the family rites of yesteryear . . . with      special foods and decorations, time-honored outings and      ceremonies, and characteristic music and dance. And more      and more folks these days are reviving the custom of      exchanging simple, sturdy handcrafted items, rather than      purchasing a passel of playthings that are readymade and,      all too often, very readily <em>destroyed.</em><br />      <br />      Well, one traditional toy that never seems to lose its      charm is the folk puzzle. These homemade brain teasers      require generous amounts of ingenuity to solve-making      them a challenge to old and young alike-yet call for      very little in the way of funds or materials for their      construction.<br />      <br />      The following two puzzles have provided our family and      friends with countless hours of enjoyment (and      frustration!) over the years. The Camel and the Needle is      perplexing but simple enough to give you a chance to      sharpen your wits before daring to take on the Ring Thing      (known to some as "the world's cussedest puzzle"). You'll      find that both games offer plenty of indoor diversion for a      winter's evening. And because they're so easy (and      inexpensive) to cobble together, you might even consider      making a few extras to give as stocking stuffers.    </p>    <p>     <strong>THE CAMEL AND THE NEEDLE</strong>     </p>        <p>      This puzzle-named after the scriptural comparison of      a rich man's chances of getting into heaven with the      ability of a camel to pass through the eye of a      needle-is one of the oldest of all folk puzzles. (You      may also know it by the moniker of Ox Yoke or      Washer-and-Loop Puzzle.) Even at today's prices, you can      make this toy for less than a dollar, and it'll take you no      more than five minutes to construct it. I consider that a      small cost for a puzzle that will furnish you with many      hours of fun!<br />      <br />      The "needle" in the puzzle is a stick of scrap wood . . .      the "eye" consists of three holes in the wood, through      which a cord is passed and tied . . . and the "camel" is a      washer, a nut, or any similar circular object that can be      threaded onto the string.<br />      <br />      To make the Camel and the Needle, choose a slender board (I      used a section of 3/4" oak) that measures about 9" in      length, and drill a 1/4"- or 3/8"-diameter hole in the      center of that slat. Next, bore two more holes of the same      diameter, each approximately 1" from either end of the      board. All the holes should be small enough to prevent the      camel from passing through them but large enough to allow a      heavy cord or piece of material to move through      freely.<br />      <br />      Once the holes are drilled, you'll need to locate a      suitable length of cord. I've found that a 3' strand works      well. The thicker it is, the better, as long as it passes      easily through the openings. To attach the cord, feed both      ends through the center hole, then drop them through the      loop produced and snug up the knot you've just      formed.<br />      <br />      Now slip the camel of your choosing over one of the two      loose ends of cord and then secure that strand to the      appropriate end hole, using a couple of half hitches.      Repeat this procedure with another camel, tying the      remaining free cord to the hole at the other end of the      board (see photo). The result will be a plank with two      large loops hanging from it.<br />      <br />      To work the puzzle, move one washer or nut past the knot in      the middle so that <em>both</em> camels are in the same      loop . . . and do so without untying the knots or cutting      the cord. You may not think so at first, but the Camel and      the Needle can be solved legitimately and quickly. (HINT:      Since the camels cannot pass through the hole in the      middle, you must find a way to pass one of them through the      center knot itself.)<br />      <br />      The average time for cracking the puzzle (not counting      those folks who give up altogether) is 47 minutes. You      should congratulate yourself if you can do it faster than      that . . . and if you solve the puzzle in less than 15      minutes, you're definitely ready to graduate to the Ring      Thing.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE RING THING</strong><br />      <br />      Some years ago (or so the story goes) a repentant prisoner      serving a life sentence begged repeatedly for a second      chance to "go straight," but the warden regularly turned a      deaf ear to his plea. Then one day the official had a      sudden change of heart and offered parole to the inmate on      the following condition: The convict had to invent a puzzle      so tough that no one connected with the prison or in the      local community could solve it. However, the puzzle had to      have an honest solution.<br />      <br />      So the convict went to work, spending every free minute      racking his brain for an idea for the world's most      difficult brain teaser. Months passed, with only      frustration to show for his efforts. But finally, the      prisoner asked permission to visit the warden. Laying the      Ring Thing on the official's desk, the convict challenged      him to solve it.<br />      <br />      For days the warden struggled with the puzzle, but to no      avail: He was truly stumped. The official then asked the      prison guards, the inmates, the leaders of the local      community-everyone, in fact, who might possess the      intelligence, persistence, and patience to solve the      puzzle-for help. At the end of three months, however, the      Ring Thing remained unsolved . . . and the clever prisoner      then walked out of the compound a free man.<br />      <br />      Although the veracity of that story may be a matter for      discussion, it's clear that-regardless of how the      puzzle came into being-this toy is one of the      toughest brain teasers ever loosed on a human mind. On the      surface, the Ring Thing is a very simple puzzle (after all,      it consists only of six metal rings, a bent coat hanger,      six bent nails, and a small piece of scrap lumber), yet it      takes remarkable wit to solve the brain teaser in less than      four hours.<br />      <br />      To make the game, cut a 1/2"- to 3/4"- thick board (I used      a slab of birchwood) to measure 2-1/2" X 20", and shape a      handle in one end. Then, measuring in about 5" from the end      of the handle, drill a hole that's approximately 1/4" in      diameter (you want it small enough that nailheads won't be      able to pass through), and continue to bore five more holes      of the same size at 1-3/4" intervals.<br />      <br />      Next, pass a 20d nail up through each hole from the      <em>underside</em> of the board, so that you end up with      six skyward-pointing spikes. Now head to the hardware store      and purchase six metal harness rings with an inside      diameter of 2". Then, with loops in hand, position the      puzzle so that the handle end is closest to you. Next,      using Vise-Grips or a similar tool, bend the point of the      closest nail so that it wraps loosely around the first      metal loop. (You can heat the nail to a cherry red      temperature with an oxyacetylene or Mapp gas torch for      easier bending.) When properly secured, the ring should      rotate easily and should <em>encircle</em> the next nail      (see photo). Repeat this procedure for the following ring      and nail, making certain, as you attach it, that the      <em>third</em> nail rests inside the second ring. Continue      securing the rings in this manner until all the loops are      in place (the last circle, obviously, will not overlap a      second nail).<br />      <br />      You're now ready to insert the wire into the puzzle. Any 3'      strand of stiff 1/8" wire-such as a straightened coat      hanger or electrical wireworks well for this task. Once      you've made sure that all six rings are properly attached      and positioned so that they "point" <em>away</em> from the      handle of the board, thread the wire through the rings to      the <em>right</em> of the nails, inserting the strand      <em>under</em> the near side and <em>over</em> the far side      of each loop (see photo). When you reach the last ring,      curve the wire and thread it back through the rings,      mirroring the first threading sequence, but this time to      the <em>left</em> side of the nails.<br />      <br />      To complete the Ring Thing, bend, weld, or otherwise      connect the two ends of the wire so that you've formed an      elongated oval. If you like, you can add a handle to the      wire to dress up the toy.<br />      <br />      Now set the game across your knees, thus allowing the nails      to hang freely, and-using both hands-work the puzzle. The      trick, of course, is to remove the wire from the puzzle      without unfastening the rings or the wire. (HINT: Once      you've freed the wire from the first loop-he one      farthest from the handle-pull the wire toward the      handle so that it hooks on the first nail: Now, slip the      second ring <em>through</em> the wire, then bring the wire      forward again and slip the first ring through. You'll have      to repeat this sequence many times to arrive at the      solution.) There are over 50 moves before the puzzle is      solved, after which you can use the techniques you've just      learned to reposition the wire.<br />      <br />      Good luck!<br />      <br />      <strong>EDITOR'S NOTE:</strong>      <em>Stumped? Well-if you must-see the sidebar for the      solutions to the puz. zles. But don't peek until you've      exhausted al, other strategies (short of dismantling the      pieces), because-after all-the fun is in</em> finding      <em>the solution!</em>    </p>        <h3>      Puzzle Pointers    </h3>    <p>      <em>Have you given up</em> already? <em>Well, here are the      solutions. . . if you really think you need them.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CAMEL</strong> <strong>AND THE NEEDLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>To work this puzzle, turn it so that the center loop      runs</em> behind <em>the two center strands, and pull down      on the loop to enlarge it. Now, move the right ring up      through the center loop and then behind it, as shown in      Fig. 1. Next, feed the</em> entire <em>center loop through      the center hole.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>On the</em> back <em>side of the puzzle, feed the ring      through</em> two <em>loops (see Fig. 2), then pull the      center loop back through the center hole. Now, pull the      ring back through the center loop. Both rings should hang      on the left loop. Follow this same sequence to put the      puzzle in its original form.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE RING THING</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Explaining how to</em> solve <em>this puzzle is almost      as difficult as working the brain teaser! Although each      step of the solution is given here, you may want to attempt      to figure it out on your own after you understand the basic      technique.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Set the puzzle so it straddles your knees, with the      handle on your right knee. From left to right, then,      mentally number the rings and nails 1 through 6 (from here      on, the rings and nails will be referred to as R1, N2,      etc.).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Pull the wire to the right so that it snugs against N1,      thus freeing R1. Next, push the wire back slightly and</em>      under the <em>left-hand side of R2. Tilt R2 and "drop" it      through the wire. Then push the wire to the left and drop      R1 through. When you pull the wire to the right, it will be      hooked on N3, with R1, R2, and R3 free. Now, push the wire      slightly left and drop R4 through. By this time, you'll      notice a sequence emerging: To drop and free a ring and the      nail it's attached to, the wire must be hooked around      the</em> <em>receding nail. Therefore, to free N3, you need      to go back and hook the wire around N2 .To do so, push the      wire through R3 and</em> <em>over the tops of R2 and R1.      Now "pick up" R1 (by pulling it back up through the wire      and setting it in its original position), then do the same      to R2. The puzzle should now look as it did at the      start-with one side of the rings over the wire and      the other side under the wire-except that R4 is free,      with both sides under the wire. Then drop R1, so that the      wire hooks on N2. This enables you to drop R3. Next, go      back over R1 and pick it up; then drop R2. Then drop R1 . .      . and pull the wire to the right. You should be hooked on      N5, which puts you in position to drop R6. Congratulations.      . . you've just completed, in essence, the first "step" by      removing R6. Your objective now is to remove R5 (by hooking      on N4) . . . then remove R4 (by hooking on N3). . . and so      on.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To hook on N4, go forward (again, always over the      rings) and pick up R1. Then pick up R2, drop R1, and pick      up R3. Go back and pick up R1, drop R2, then drop R1. You      should be hooked on N3, so you can pick up R4. To get rid      of N3, pick up R1 and R2, drop R1, drop R3, pick up R1,      drop R2, and drop R1. You're now hooked on N4, so drop      R5.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>With that done, pick up RI and R2, drop R1, and pick up      R3. Go forward again and pick up R1, drop R2, and drop R1.      You're hooked on N3, so drop R4. Now, pick up R1 and R2,      drop R1, and drop R3. Then simply pick up R1, drop R2, and      drop R1 . . . and you're</em> off! <em>(Now, that wasn't so      hard, was it?)</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To get the puzzle back together, use the same general      technique. You'll need to hook around N5 so you can pickup      R6, then hook on N4 to pick up R5, and so on.</em>    </p>
