                <p>      Your Christmas decorating will take on a special      significance with these tree trimmings.    </p>            <p>      Handcrafted Ornaments Nowadays, it seems that      advertisements begin proclaiming holiday bargains on gifts      and decorations before we have a chance to savor the last      bite of Thanksgiving turkey. However, many folks are      finding that simply spending more money <em>doesn't</em>      assure a merrier Christmas . . . and, in an effort to      regain the simplicity that once characterized this special      holiday, more and more people are fashioning their      <em>own</em> gifts and ornaments.<br />      <br />      If you're seeking ideas for handcrafted trim mings to adorn      your tree or to give as gifts, you're sure to find      inspiration in the work of Virginia Morris, an artist who's      lived in Black Mountain, North Carolina, for more than 20      years. Her distinctly original, delicate creations offer      welcome alternatives to the profusion of commercial      look-alike tree trinkets. And, though the decorations      pictured here are quite intricate, Virginia's basic      techniques are so straightforward that even amateur crafts      people should be able to follow her tips and create      attractive ornaments.<br />      <br />      <strong>NUTTY CREATIONS</strong><br />      <br />      Using such ordinary natural objects as walnuts, acorns,      seedpods, and dried flowers, Virginia creates intricate      ornaments that fairly shout with ingenuity (have you ever      seen a walnut-shell hot rod or baby buggy before?).      Grapevines, dried flowers, grasses, and nuts serve as ideal      trimmings, and with the addition of a scrap of felt or      flannel, some rope, a bit of yarn, and a touch of      all-purpose glue, the natural finds are transfigured into      delicate pieces of artwork. Virginia <em>does</em> advise      purchasing the walnuts, though, to ensure that you'll have      unblemished shells. Jumbosize nuts work best.<br />      <br />      Ms. Morris suggests the same basic technique to make each      ornament. To split the shells while keeping the halves      intact, find the widest opening along the "seam" of the nut      and gently insert a knife in the crack. Then pry the walnut      apart and scoop out the innards.<br />      <br />      Once the walnut is pried apart and cleaned, you can fashion      the halves into practically any design. To make the hot      rod, cut one walnut section in half to form the seat and      hood of the car. Then cover the seat with glue, line it      with felt, and glue the whole shebang into a half-shell      auto. The hood is attached next, then the red trim is      added. The driver shown here is simply a hemlock cone with      an acorn head (on which Virginia painted a face) and cap.      Twig arms guide the acorn-cap steering wheel, and the head-      and taillights of the vehicle are fashioned from immature      acorns. Virginia made the car's wheels by drilling a 1/8"      hole in each of four acorn caps, then inserting matchstick      axles into the openings. The resulting apparatus was then      glued to the base of the chassis. A plastic windshield and      a crocheted scarf top off the ornament, though-for      custom work-Virginia often adds a personalized      license tag.<br />      <br />      The baby buggy is crafted in a similar manner, with the      same close attention to details. Scraps of red and white      brushed flannel furnish a cozy bed for the swaddled acorn      twins . . . a characteristic handle-fashioned from a      braided strand of rope-is attached to the buggy's      front . . . and the axles and wheels are identical to those      of the hot rod.<br />      <br />      Each of the flower basket decorations pictured here is set      in half a walnut shell. A section of polystyrene foam glued      in the bottom of each shell forms a base for inserting the      dried flowers and gluing the nuts in place . . . and a      braided-hemp handle and a ribbon of brightly colored burlap      complete the arrangement. Virginia notes that it's      important to gather the dried materials before they become      brittle and to coat the foraged finds <em>immediately</em>      with a craft spray (the type used to prevent charcoal      drawings from smudging) to keep them from shredding.<br />      <br />      The bird's-nest ornament is fashioned from a large acorn      cap. Acorn-and-seedpod fledglings chirp for their dinner      from a bed lined with fine, loose strands of rope . . .      dried flowers and a grapevine sprig grace the side of the      nest . . . and a twisted-hemp handle allows for easy      hanging on the tree.<br />      <br />      Perhaps none of the decorations so simply set forth the      spirit of Christmas as Virginia's "peace on earth"      ornament. Ten 1/8" holes drilled along the edges of each      walnut half enable two leather strands to be threaded      through the ornament and tied at the top. Other than the      simple inscription, which was written with a woodburning      tool, the only adornments are a pair of leather leaves and      a couple of dried seedpods.<br />      <br />      The caroler piece can serve as a tree ornament, mantle      decoration, or centerpiece. A wooden spool, flanked by two      1-1/2"-diameter circles of scrap wood and by matching felt      cushions, forms the base of the ornament. The carolers are      fashioned out of hemlock cones with acorn heads and caps,      yarn hair, and twig arms that hold leather hymnals (one      caroler has a trumpet in hand as well!). At the feet of the      singers sits a dog-made from an acorn, twigs, and      scraps of hemlock-decked out in a festive yarn      collar. Other touches to the familiar scene include a      matchstick-and-acorn lamp on which a Christmas wreath      hangs, a dried-twig evergreen, and glue-and-tissue-paper      snow covering the ground.<br />      <br />      <strong>CREATE YOUR OWN</strong><br />      <br />      The ornaments pictured here are just a sampling of some of      the creations you can fashion with natural materials.      You'll no doubt come up with many of your own custom-made      designs. Although your first few attempts may not be as      intricate as those shown here, you'll find that even the      simplest handcrafted ornament will bring far more joy to      its recipient than could the gift of any glitter-laden      storebought trinket. And isn't that, after all, what      Christmas is all about?    </p>
