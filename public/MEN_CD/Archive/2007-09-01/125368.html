        <p>Adequate storage space is important for any well-designed home or homestead. Whether in an urban, suburban or rural setting, we all need places to easily store and organize our stuff. This is especially true for gardeners and small farmers who have tools and machines that help them work more efficiently.</p><p>Most of us carve out storage space from the garage or basement, or purchase a portable metal storage shed. But you can make a well-crafted tool shed or small barn, designed for your personal needs, that will be much more useful and satisfying. Even small backyards have room for a <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1985-09-01/Mothers-Add-on-Garden-Toolshed.aspx" target="_blank">toolshed</a> tacked on to a garage wall or a <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1993-08-01/Backyard-Shed.aspx" target="_blank">shed</a> tucked away in a corner of the yard. Firewood can also benefit from a proper storage space. While a plastic tarp thrown over the stack is one way to protect the wood, an all-season <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/1995-08-01/A-Timber-Frame-Woodshed.aspx" target="_blank">woodshed</a> is a more attractive and permanent solution.</p><p>Across much of America, you can see examples of <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock-and-Farming/2004-10-01/Beautiful-Barns.aspx" target="_blank">barns</a>, some hundreds of years old. Their designs range from round to rambling. Some are actually attached to the farmhouse.</p><p>Today’s farms seldom need a large, multi-stalled, high haymow barn, but many homesteads can benefit from a place to house a few chickens, a couple of goats, feed and even a <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Homesteading-and-Self-Reliance/2006-04-01/Discover-Versatile-Compact-Tractors.aspx" target="_blank">compact tractor</a>.

The <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/detail.aspx?ItemNumber=777" target="_blank">little red barn</a> plan is expandable: Start out with an 8-by-12-foot stick-built section and later you can add a lean-to on one side or both - depending on your finances, energy level and needs. The other plan also uses dimension lumber for framing, but the walls are made from <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Green-Home-Building/2003-06-01/The-Charm-of-Cordwood-Construction.aspx" target="_blank">cordwood construction</a>.</p><p>Whatever your storage needs, building a shed or small barn might be just the way to unclutter your 21st-century homestead.</p><p>Do you have other tips for folks who want to build a shed or barn for storage space?
