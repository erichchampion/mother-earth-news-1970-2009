        <p>Garlic. The word alone stirs the senses with memories ofpowerful aromas, zesty flavors and memorable, savory meals. You'dbe hard-pressed to find someone who doesn't enjoy this punchyallium, and you might be surprised at the range of dishes that areimproved by it. Breads, sauces, appetizers and entrees ? just abouteverything short of cheesecake takes on a bold, flavorful tastewith this versatile kitchen staple.</p><br /><p>But garlic does more than add flavor: It's been used for foodand medicinal purposes since at least 3000 B.C., renowned for itspowerful antiviral and antibacterial properties. As the realm ofholistic health has grown, it's now also recommended to helpprevent heart disease (it can lower cholesterol and blood pressure)and even cancer. In<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/browse.aspx?SearchType=B&Search=green+pharmacy" target="_blank">The Green Pharmacy</a>, James A. Duke, Ph.D.,   suggests garlic to treat allergies, athlete's foot, diabetes,   colds, the flu and more.</p><br /><p>You can easily enjoy the numerous benefits of garlic, for thepalate and body, by growing your own this season. Fall is aterrific time to plant garlic, and come summer you'll be rewardedwith large, flavor-packed heads ready for nibbling, cooking andpreserving.</p><br /><p>Garlic is simple to grow. Good soil, full sun and watering everyfew days are its main requirements, and garlic doesn't attract manyinsects ? it can even deter them from other crops! If the plantbegins to flower, snip the stalk to keep growth energy directed tothe bulb instead. You'll know it's time to harvest when the tops ofthe stalks start to brown.</p><br /><p>Served as an appetizer, spread on bread, or mixed in mashedpotatoes, one of the simplest, most useful garlic preparations isroasted garlic. These basic recipes are adapted from <em>Growingand Using Garlic</em>, by Glenn Andrews.</p><br /><p><strong>Roasted Garlic</strong></p><br /><p>1 whole head garlic<br /> 1 tsp olive oil</p><br /><p>Preheat your oven to 450 degrees. Slice off the top fifth of thegarlic head. Place the head on a medium-size square of heavy-dutyaluminum foil. Drizzle the olive oil over garlic. Seal the foilsecurely. (Unless you want your whole house to smell of garlic,don't crumple the foil too much; this would create cracks throughwhich the aroma could escape.) Bake for 40 minutes, the garlicshould be golden brown.</p><br /><p>Garlic also makes a yummy, easy hummus:</p><br /><p><strong>Hummus</strong></p><br /><p>1 cup dried chickpeas (garbanzos)<br /> Water</p><br /><p>1/4 cup lemon juice<br /> 1? teaspoons garlic, minced (about 3 cloves)<br /> 1/2 cup tahini (sesame paste, available at mostsupermarkets)<br /> Salt to taste</p><br /><p>Soak the chickpeas overnight in enough water to cover by atleast 1 inch.</p><br /><p>Drain. Cover amply again with fresh water. Boil for about anhour, or until very soft. Drain again. Put chickpeas, along withlemon juice, garlic, tahini and salt, in a food processor orblender and run the machine until the hummus is smooth. (You mayhave to add a little water, one tablespoon at a time, to make themixture thin enough to process. The consistency you want is similarto mayonnaise.)</p><br /><p>Serve as a spread or dip for pita chips or triangles of toastedpita bread. Makes about 2 cups.</p><br /><p>Learn more about garlic varieties and growing, braiding, cookingand preserving garlic in the<a href="https://www.motherearthshopping.com/order/order.aspx?PromoCode=MMEEN796&utm_source=MEL&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=MMEEN796" target="_blank">Growing and Using Garlic</a> e-handbook from   <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>.</p><br /><p>Share your garlic recipes and growing tips in the commentssection below.</p><br />
