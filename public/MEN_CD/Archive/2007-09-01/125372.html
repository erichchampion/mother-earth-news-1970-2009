        <p>So, a little weasel is getting your chickens. The raccoons areeating more of your sweet corn than you are. Or maybe a skunk isstealing eggs. Like most folks, you enjoy having wildlife nearby,but you have your limits. Live traps can be a diplomaticsolution.</p><br /><p>You can buy a metal cage trap pretty inexpensively ? especiallywhen you consider the cost of your losses and the durability of ametal trap. You also can build a wooden trap from scrap lumber andsome hardware cloth (wire mesh). It's a relatively simply processand you could make several different sizes of traps in anafternoon, even without using power tools(<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/DIY/1978-07-01/This-Humane-Trap-Can-Guard-Your-Vegetable-Patch.aspx" target="_blank">instructions</a> are online).</p><br /><p>Bait the trap with corn, fish, cat food (lots of animals lovecat food) or whatever works in your situation. The critter entersthe trap and hits the release, the doors snap shut, and you have atrapped wild animal on your hands. Now what?</p><br /><p>Trapping a varmint is easy. What you do with it afterward is thehard part ? especially if it's a skunk. You have severalchoices:</p><br /><ol><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Put the critter (trap and all) in the back of a truck, drive tothe next county and open the trap. (A friend of mine refers to thisas the 'witness relocation program.') Just remember, turnabout isfair play. People in the next county might be relocating varmintsto your county, too.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Have a reasonable conversation with the critter. Explain yourinvestment of time and financial resources in your garden orpoultry flock. Offer to set out additional dog food if he'll leaveyour garden and chickens alone.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li><li>Build a large, natural habitat with observation areas and callit a zoo.</li><li style="list-style: none"><br /></li></ol><br /><p>But seriously, if you have indeed trapped a live animal, becautious when moving the trap and releasing the animal. Theexpression 'fighting like a trapped animal' should come to mind atthis point. The animal is frightened and feels threatened, and willdo whatever it can to protect its life ? including, but not limitedto, clawing and biting. (Remember, some varmints could conceivablybe rabid.)</p><br /><p>Be careful not to get any part of your body so close to the cagethat the animal could injure you. One possibility is to push dowelrods or thin pipes through the wire mesh to make carrying poles.Moving the cage using this method would require two people.</p><br /><p>If you've trapped a skunk, you probably need additional advice.Specific information on coping with skunks can be found by clicking<a href="http://magazine.audubon.org/journal/journal0309.html" target="_blank">here</a>or<a href="http://www.howtogetridofstuff.com/pest-control/how-to-get-rid-of-skunks" target="_blank">here</a>.</p><br /><p>Trapping isn't your only option, of course. Co-existing is apossibility. Consider these options, too:</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/issues/motherearthliving/nature/Wildlife-Habitat-in-Your-Backyard_448-1.html" target="_blank">Create wildlife habitat in your backyard</a>.</p><br /><p>Consider<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Livestock-and-Farming/1998-06-01/Working-Like-a-Dog.aspx" target="_blank">livestock guard dogs</a>.</p><br /><p><a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/detail.aspx?ItemNumber=3424" target="_blank">Pest Proofing your Garden</a> is an e-book that offers manysuggestions on keeping critters out of your garden.
