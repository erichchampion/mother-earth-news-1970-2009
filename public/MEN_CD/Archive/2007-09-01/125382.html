        <p>Bestselling author Barbara Kingsolver frequently writes about food, and in her essay <a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole-Foods-and-Cooking/2005-08-01/Viewpoint.aspx" target="_blank">Lily's Chickens</a> she writes that she has become captivated by the alchemy of making butter and cheese. But while cheese is an art, Kingsolver writes, butter is a sport.</p><p>It's hard to disagree. Not only does making butter involve a certain amount of physical effort (unless you use a blender) but the whole process is pretty straightforward. In fact, because making butter is so simple, it makes a great project for kids ? or adults. It's a fast and easy process that lets you see for yourself where this basic and familiar food comes from.</p><p><strong>The Basic Process</strong></p><p>To make butter, first start with a simple ingredient, heavy cream. You can buy whipping cream at the grocery store, although if you live in a part of the country where you can get fresh cream from a dairy, so much the better.</p><p>Next, stir up the cream so that the butterfat globules begin to separate from the liquid. One of the simplest ways to do this is to get a canning jar with a sturdy lid and fill it about one-third full of cream. Then simply shake the jar until you feel and see the butter separate. When that happens, there's a sudden and noticeable difference in the consistency. That's the time to stop shaking.</p><p>Now separate the butter from the buttermilk by straining it. A colander or piece of cheesecloth may be helpful for this task. Rinse the butter with cold water, gently turning the butter with a spoon while the cold water runs over it until the water runs clear. Then mix in a little bit of salt, to taste ? or leave the butter unsalted if you prefer. Put the butter in the refrigerator. Let it chill, and then it's ready to eat!</p><p>Of course, you could forgo the canning jar and make butter in an old-fashioned butter churn, or in a mixer. Whichever tool you choose, the basic process is the same. The main difference is the amount of effort it takes to whip the cream into butter.</p><p><strong>Other Approaches</strong></p><p>Here are a few places on the Web where you can find more information about making butter, including helpful tips and fun photos:</p><p><strong>The Scientific Breakdown.</strong> The Web site <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/" target="_blank">Cooking for Engineers</a> has a fun and analytical approach to cooking.
