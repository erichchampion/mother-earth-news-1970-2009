        <h3>Bee Sting Salve</h3><p>The best home remedy for bee, waspand bumble bee stings is to cut an onion inhalf and apply it right to the sting. After afew moments of slightly sharper stinging,the pain will diminish almost immediately,and the sting will heal in a short while. Ialways keep an onion in my first aid kitwhen traveling, camping, etc.</p><p>Teresa McSween</p><h3>Hot Potatoes and Plentiful Produce</h3><p>We have a big lawn, and eliminating thegrass clippings had always been aproblem. We used to let the garbageservice haul away our bags full ofclippings-then we decided to use themourselves ...on the potatoes.</p><p>When our potatoes are about a foot tallwe drag the clippings out to the gardenand carefully pile their warm contentsaround the base of the plants, coveringthem until only the tips of the plantsshow above the grassy compost. The potatoes grow remarkably fast,getting close to five feet tall before tippingover. Heavy rains compress the grasscompost into a dense mass, and at harvesttime we simply remove the grass mat byrolling it back with a garden rake. Diggingdown into the soil we find a solid mass ofuniformly shaped potatoes, which wesimply pick off the</p><p>ground. This eliminates hoeing and, byleaving the grass compost in place, we canspread it over the garden the followingspring.</p><p>Doris Stebbins</p><p>Danville, VT</p><p>To have beautiful and deliciousgreens early in the year, trysowing spinach in the middle ofautumn. The plants will grow tomedium size before winter sets in...and they'll burst forth in</p><p>the early spring with loads ofgreens, while your other veggies arejust sprouting.</p><p>Lance Melon</p><p>Woodward, PA</p><p>Don't let spare garden produce goto waste! Take it to a senior citizens'</p><p>apartment complex. You'll findplenty of eager recipients.</p><p>Margaret Shauers</p><p>Great Bend, KS .</p><h3>Tool Talk</h3><p>Everyone knows to use pastey</p><p>floor wax to keep the wood</p><p>handles of your tools in shape,but what about the businessend? Try this recycling trick:</p><p>Fill a five-gallon bucket with sharp sandand add leftover oil collected from an oilchange. After each use of a metal-endedtool, jam it in the sand to clean andpreserve it.</p><p>Gaynya Tallmadge</p><p>Commerce, 7X</p><p>When you break the handle of yourhammer, axe or maul, the easiest way toreplace it is to heat the head in a 250°Foven for about an hour. This shrinks thewood and expands the metal. Pull out theold wood and have the new handle readyto insert while the iron is hot. And usepot holders to handle the hot metal!</p><p><em>Dale Tallmadge</em> <em>Commerce, 7X</em></p><h3>Shoo Fly</h3><p>Need to get rid of an infestation offruit flies? Mix one quart of water with 14drops of lemongrass essential oil. Shakewell and pour into a spray bottle. Thenspray the areas where you see the flies:walls, ceiling, whatever. Eventually thecritters will disappear. You can also usegarlic water, but I've had greater successwith the lemongrass water spray. Thismethod is not toxic at all and smells great,too.</p><p>Anita-Louise Halstead</p><p>Los Angeles, CA</p><p><strong>A Tropical</strong></p><h3>Recipe</h3><p>Just</p><p>thought I'dshare a</p><p>,., recipe with you.It's called pineap</p><p>ple zucchini. Start with fourquarts of zucchini,</p><p>t' peeled, seeded and diced intoone-inch cubes. Add 1% cup</p><p>lemon juice, one 46 oz. can ofpineapple juice (unsweetened) andthree cups of sugar. Combine allingredients in a pot and simmer for</p><p>20 minutes. Let cool and put in jars.Yields three to four quarts or six to eightpints. It takes about three weeks for thezucchini to be fully pineapple-flavored.</p><p>Julieann Reed Edmonton, KY</p><h3>More tips and handy hints, from MOTHERS backyards, barnsand breadbaskets.</h3><p>can over and turning it. Our tumbler wascheap to make and is easy to use. Best ofall, we have finished, usable compost inseveral weeks.</p><p>M. Terifay</p><p>Fleetwood, PA</p><h3>Sticky Sap No More</h3><p>Here's something that I always have inmy pocket and that has come to myrescue many times. Have you ever beenout camping or hiking and gotten thesticky sap of a pine or spruce on yourhands? As we all know, soap and waterwon't get it off-but that little tube ofChap Stick' in your pocket will take it offcompletely. It's also great for getting offthat nasty adhesive left from pricestickers. I recently bought a pair ofreading glasses that had the price stickerstuck onto the right lens. My ChapStick(restricted) got the sticker gunk off in a flashwithout harming the lens. For years I havewanted to share this secret but didn'tknow how to get the word out. Thanks,</p><p>MOTHER!</p><p>Andy Wazelle</p><p>Machias, ME</p><h3>Egg Your Slugs and Splinters</h3><p><strong>if</strong> you have a splinter you can't getout, break open an egg and retrieve themembrane that's around the inside of theshell. Put a little bit of this membraneover the splinter, and in six or seven hoursthe splinter will have come out enoughthat you can pull it out the rest of theway.</p><p>Buck Kubs</p><p>Gowanda, NY</p><p>The biggest worry I have for mygarden is that slugs are going to eat myvegetables before I do. Since I do not liketo use chemicals in my garden, I crunchup empty eggshells and sprinkle themaround the edges of the garden. They aremuch too pointy and pokey for the slugsto get over!</p><p>Kathryn Carrier</p><p>Portland, OR</p><h3>Vinegar Solutio ns</h3><p>Here are two simple uses forapple cider vinegar that haveproved very helpful to me andthat I hope will be of use toothers:</p><p>1. Scale or calcium builduparound your sink? Saturate papertowels with apple cider vinegarand place around faucets atbedtime. Wipe away unsightlyscale the next morning. Mayrequire a second application forheavy buildup.</p><p>2. Here's a better way to peelhard-boiled eggs: using a needle orstickpin, punch hole in butt</p><p>end of egg before boiling. Add a smallamount of apple cider vinegar and salt towater. Start eggs in cold water, bring toboil and let boil for ten minutes.</p><p>Ben W Ulmer</p><p>Moncks Corner, SC</p><h3>High-Tech Scarecrows</h3><p>My husband's chickens and guineahens just wouldn't stay out of my gardenand flower beds. I found a way to keepthem out, as well as the birds thatwouldn't stay out of my fruit trees. Atleast once a week we receive a CD withsorne Internet offer. We used to justthrow them out, but I found that thebright and shiny side reflects light andproduces a prism of colors as they wavein the wind. These fluttering distractionskeep the birds away, both domestic andwild. I used fence stretch bars to hangthem on. The material CDs are made fromis pliable and can be bent and drilledwithout trouble. It's not only galvanized(thus rust-resistant), but it's also free.</p><p>Phyllis Mattena</p><p>Pine Canyon, UT</p><h3>When You're in a Jamb</h3><p>Sometimes a project requires you todraw a straight line down the side of apipe, dowel or other cylindrical piece.The rather difficult job of drawing thestraight line along the length of acylindrical surface can be quickly andeasily done using any doorjamb. Themolding forms a natural "vee" block whena pipe or dowel is placed up against it.Using the molding as a straight edge, drawa pencil line on the surface of the cylinderby running the pencil down the length ofthe doorjamb.</p><p>Arthur R. Lee Santa Cruz,GA</p><h3>Don't Tr e ad on Me</h3><p>I found this idea in a 1948 book of</p><p>household hints: Is the carpet on your stairs old and worn? Make it look new by moving the carpet up or down half a step. That way the unworn riser sections will now rest nn the steps, and the threadbare spots will be moved to the risers, where they won't show as much. <em>Helen Puls</em><em>Canby, OR</em></p>
