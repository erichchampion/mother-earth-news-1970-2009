                            <p>      Although the FDA has not yet granted approval for medical      applications, laboratory testing has uncovered a wide range      of uses for the off. Researchers of Medical Physiology at      the University of Saskatchewan have found that the oil,      when applied to post-operative wounds, promotes healing,      while the Department of Pathology and Microbiology at the      University of Prince Edward Island's Atlantic Veterinary      College has discovered that emu oil reduces auricular      inflammation in mice. In its unrefined state, emu oil      contains linolenic oil and andoleic acid, and serves as a      carrier for antioxidants and vitamin C. It can penetrate up      to seven layers of skin.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Emu oil can be used for products as diverse as      moisturizers, eye creams and hair products.</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Refined oil has been on the market at most for about three      years," says Montie Morris, plant manager of Emu Producers      International Cooperative (EPIC). "The industry in the late      '80s went more toward breeders before it tried to get a      commercial market. Now we have importers from overseas."      The EPIC oil refinery produces 5,000 pounds of oil daily      for commercial use in cosmetics like moisturizers, eye      creams and hair products. Other companies have begun      marketing the oil as an anti-inflammatory to high profile      sports teams in the National Basketball Association and the      National Football League.    </p>    <p>      According to Morris, consumers should look for refined,      deodorized oil that has gone through a process of      sterilization, and they should be wary of ads claiming emu      oil as a cure-all to chronic diseases.    </p>        <p>      Their ability to thrive on a minimal diet and under harsh      conditions make emus an ecologically attractive commodity.      Their meat, eggs, feathers, oil and hide are completely      usable, and their powerful claws act as small garden      tillers, helping to turn and cultivate the soil. Says Neil      Williams, president of the American Emu Association: "The      emu industry used to be a `bird business.' Today we're:      selling quality products."    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ruchel Rokicki</em>    </p>
