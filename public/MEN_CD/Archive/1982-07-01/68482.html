        <p>Here's an alternative to the Saturday-night bath in a washtub.</p><p>My friend and I acquired our homestead in the mountains of western Washington through the good graces of a pair of true pioneers. After that hardy couple had compiled over 160 years of life experience between them, they decided that residing ten miles from the nearest town and a mile from the road was no longer in their best interests. And when the two sold their property, my partner and I were the lucky buyers.</p><p>Our move from Seattle to the Cascade Mountains involved a complete change of lifestyle for us, and-like many back-to-thelanders-we put in our fair share of grimy, sweaty hours while shaping up the newly purchased acreage. During that period the one remnant of "civilization" that we <em>both</em> missed most was the chance to take an occasional honest-to-goodness hot shower. There were times when a dip in a nearby cold lake or a sponge bath just didn't measure up . . . and we began to think that heaven could be defined as the opportunity to simply stand under a hot spray forever.</p><p>Although our home would probably appear primitive to many people, however, we do have two amenities that make it possible to run a wringer washer: a cold water system (which connects with the outdoor faucets and an indoor sink) and electricity. And since we don't have a septic tank, we've set up the vintage Maytag in a sunny clearing amid some towering Douglas firs. A hose supplies the machine with cold water . . . an extension cord from the cabin furnishes the juice . . . and after the machine's done its work, the gray water drains into a hole in the ground beneath it.</p><p>One day while I was doing the wash (and getting rather hot and gritty myself in the process of cleaning our clothes), an idea popped into my head: If the machine's pump could empty a tank of dirty laundry water, why couldn't it dispose of a tankful of <em>clean</em> liquid . . . and do so on my waiting head?</p><p>A few days later, after the notion had percolated a bit, an adventuresome acquaintance came for a weekend visit. Within four hours from the time I shared my brainstorm, the Maytag shower was primed and ready to go.</p><p>We began bringing about the washer's metamorphosis with a four-foot piece of garden hose. One end of the tubing was secured to the drain on the machine, and an 89 cents shower head-fastened by a hose clamp-was fitted to the other. Because the washer does stand outdoors, we decided to wire together some old pipe and a flat bedspring (the most suitable junk we had on hand) to form a shower stall, which we then covered with black plastic. Next, we used more hose clamps to hitch the shower head to the top of the stall, and made a floor by drilling a number of 3/4" holes in a 24" X 36" piece of lumber from an old door. We then fitted the jerry-built grate over the hole into which the washer's gray water drains.</p><p>At this point, you might well say, "So you've built yourself a cold shower . . . swell." Well, that would have been the case had it not been for one small luxury that the property's previous owners had passed on to us: a simple electric immersion heater. We just plugged in the little water-warmer and dunked it in the Maytag's tank. It took a bit of practice to get the temperature right, but we found that we could heat the entire tubful of water to a comfortable point in just over an hour. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: It's a good idea to unplug an immersion heater before testing the water temperature. If the device is operating in a metal container, plunging a hand into the warming water can result in a nasty shock.]</em> Then we could simply disconnect the heater, hook up the washer, and revel in a veritable sluice of hot water.</p><p>Our Maytag shower has proved to be a relatively efficient indulgence, too. A single tank of water can easily provide two to four satisfactory showers . . . or one extravagant steamer. And when all we want is a quick rinse-off, a quartertank of liquid (requiring, of course, a lot less waterwarming time) will suffice.</p><p>Furthermore, as much as we appreciated that original shower-in-the-greenwood, we've since made a few improvements to our contraption. Even though the washer stands within arm's length of the shower stall, we've found it more convenient (and probably safer) to attach a wooden extension bar to the pump's on/off lever. The new handle sticks right through the stall's plastic wall, making it easy for a bather to start up or turn of the pump.</p><p>When we first constructed the bathhouse, we elected to make it three-sided and roofless . . . so we could take in the hillside panorama and the towering Douglas firs overhead while lathering up. That was a nice arrangement until cold weather moved in, but we've now added a curtain and a "ceiling" of clear plastic (which lets in plenty of light), refinements that make bathing much more comfortable on chilly days.</p><p>But perhaps best of all, our peoplewasher can be readily reconverted to a clothes washer when there's laundry to be done. All we have to do is unscrew the shower-head hose, hook up the original drain tubing (which we've now routed to run beneath the shower floor), and reassign the Maytag to its regular line of work!</p>
