                <p>      Here's a job that offers numerous financial, personal,      aesthetic, and environmental benefits.    </p>          <h5 id="byline">by       Robert Birkby    </h5>    <p>      Imagine the smell of crisp autumn air and the feel of the      wind cooling your sweaty brow as you pause in your labor to      watch a hawk soaring off toward a jagged mountain range.      Now imagine getting <em>paid</em> to work in that sort of      environment! Does it sound too good to be true? Well, such      tough but health-building jobs are available ... to folks      who contract to work for the U.S. Forestry Service.    </p>    <p>      Although it's true that most national forests have their      own crews-and generally hire professional contractors      to take care of major projects-the Forestry Service      does employ private citizens for work that involves the      maintenance and general upkeep of trails and such. As a      matter of fact, a friend and I spent a rigorous (but      wonderful) month last fall, high in the scenic mountains of      southern Oregon, laboring away on one of those "secondary"      jobs. We earned a few extra calluses, developed some new      muscles, and enjoyed ourselves in the woods while making      over $3,000 . . . and there's no reason why you can't do      the same (or better).    </p>    <p>      <strong>JOBS . . . WHAT AND WHERE?</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are national forests in nearly every state, and      although each of them is unique, most do have networks of      footpaths that need annual attention. Your task might      consist of rerouting directional signs . . . clearing      streams of debris . . . or even collecting pine cones for      tree propagation. In short, any number of housekeeping      chores are all but crying out to be taken care of in most      government-protected woods.    </p>    <p>      So how do you find out just what these jobs are? Well, you      might want to do as my friend and I did: We simply paid a      visit to our local Forestry Service office and filled out      an application to have our names put on the "Bidder's      Mailing List". By doing so, we were assured of being      notified by the Forestry Service whenever a project of      interest to us was put up for bids.    </p>    <p>      The form listed 64 categories of jobs that are sometimes      available in the national forests . . . tasks that vary      from fence construction to aerial tree spraying. An      applicant is allowed to sign up for as many different kinds      of work as he or she chooses, but since we were interested      only in trail maintenance, that was the sole area we      indicated on our applications. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE: Most      Forestry Service offices don't require you to make a      personal visit to get on the Bidder's Mailing List . . . a      phone call will usually suffice.]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>EXPERIENCE IS THE BEST TEACHER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once my friend and I had put our names in the hat, we      decided that we'd best buckle down and learn something      about the field we'd just chosen to work in. And the      logical way to get such an education, we decided, was to go      to the experts . . . people who were already experienced at      serving on forestry maintenance crews.    </p>    <p>      It was our hope that such teams would occasionally need to      take on extra part-time labor, and we thought that by      working along with these "trail hands", we could gain some      invaluable experience ourselves . . . and be better      prepared when we got the chance to bid on a contract of our      own. However, we soon found that most crews (which are made      up, on the average, of only three people) don't want to      shell out the cash to <em>hire</em> anyone else. But if      you're willing to work for a little while for free (we came      to think of the donated labor as tuition), there's plenty      to be learned from the veterans.    </p>    <p>      You could also acquire practical expertise in woods work by      contacting local volunteer organizations . . . in the East,      for example, there's the Appalachian Trail Conference      (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 236, Harpers Ferry, West Virginia      25425). These groups offer both information and hands-on      instruction in forestry techniques-as well as fun and      fellowship-in the form of weekend maintenance      outings.    </p>    <p>      But just <em>how</em> you get your "schooling" isn't as      important as the fact that you do get it. Believe me, you'd      better know what you're doing when you take on a job 20      miles from nowhere ... because there won't be anyone else      around to advise you if something goes wrong.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GET READY TO BID</strong>    </p>    <p>      After you're on the bidding list and you've gained some      experience, you can settle back and wait until a job comes      up that you'd like to tackle. It was a couple of months      before we heard from the Forestry Service . . . but when we      did, we got word that a <em>couple</em> of trail      maintenance jobs were available. As you can imagine, we      didn't lose much time in heading down to headquarters for      specific information.    </p>    <p>      Then, after reading all the fine print that defined exactly      what each assignment required, we located the trails to be      worked on and walked several miles of each to see,      firsthand, what kind of maintenance was involved. By doing      so, we learned what we needed to know to figure out what      our bid (a statement of how much time and money we'd need      to do the job) would be.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GO FOR IT!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Putting up a bid isn't as imposing a task as it might sound      at first. Again, all that's needed is a little previous      experience . . . which we'd attained by working with the      crews, remember? Simply put, as long as you have some      knowledge of what you can do and how long it should take      you to do it, you can come up with a reasonable bid. But if      you don't trust your own judgment at first, abstracts of      previous years' contracts are kept on file at Forestry      Service offices . . . and you'll be welcome to inspect      them.    </p>    <p>      To determine your bid, simply estimate how many hours the      job will require . . . figure your expenses (include gas,      tools, and <em>plenty</em> of food) . . . then add enough      profit to make the job worth your while (don't worry,      you'll <em>earn</em> it). Finally, submit your bid and hope      for the best. But remember, if you don't get the first job      you set your sights on, there'll be plenty of other      opportunities.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WORK BEGINS</strong>    </p>    <p>      We bid on both jobs and lost one (we were a bit too high, I      guess) but won the other . . . which earned us a contract      to upgrade 65 miles of trail. At that point we had to meet      with our Contracting Officer (the official to whom we were      ultimately responsible). He told us exactly what was      expected of us and introduced us to the Contracting      Officer's Representative (COR) who would actually visit the      site to inspect each leg of our work as we finished it.    </p>    <p>      The most important tool required for our work was a      McCleod: a heavy wilderness firefighting rake, equipped      with a cutting blade, that's excellent for clearing out      brush. (You can buy the tool or make your own . . . see the      accompanying diagram.) We also carried picks and      shovels-usually strapped to our backs on packboards      to free our hands for the McCleod-for prying up large      rocks and loosening tightly packed soil.    </p>    <p>      We were fortunate that "our" trails were located in a tract      of forest near our house, since that proximity allowed      us-during much of the job-to drive to the      trailhead at dawn and be home, hungry and tired, by dusk.      When tackling more remote sections, though-including      a 22-mile leg of the Pacific Coast Trail-we packed a      week's worth of provisions on mules and camped out as we      worked.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A JOB WELL DONE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Forestry Service labor isn't easy . . . in fact, you'll      probably be amazed by just how tired you feel after that      first day. Our trail contract required that we clear the      track of any stone larger than two inches-and of      anything else that had fallen onto the pathway from the      slopes above-and also clean out all of the drainage      ditches. So we did what the agreement demanded, leaving      behind only insignificant (we thought) obstructions such as      deeply rooted clumps of weeds.    </p>    <p>      When our work was inspected for the first time, however,      our COR informed us (in no uncertain terms!) that he wanted      <em>everything</em> removed . . . so we had to return to      the scene and do the job right. I suggest that you make      every effort to be thorough the <em>first</em> time.    </p>    <p>      Even so, there'll likely be moments when you'll want to      throw up your hands and quit (because your body's heavy      with fatigue and your tongue's parched from constant dust),      but hang in there. When the blues get you, just take a      break to drink some sweet spring water and look back at the      clean, inviting trail you've just cleared. Lean against a      tree and enjoy the view . . . after all, you're the one      who's made it possible for others to reach this exact spot.    </p>    <p>      You might also want to mull over just what you're getting      from your job . . . besides the money in your pocket and      aching-but stronger-muscles. You just might (as      my friend and I did) discover that there's a great deal of      satisfaction to be gained from the realization that your      work is helping to preserve our national forests . . . for      our own and other generations.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: A good source of information about trail      construction and upkeep is Robert Proudman's AMC Guide to      Trail Building and Maintenance.
