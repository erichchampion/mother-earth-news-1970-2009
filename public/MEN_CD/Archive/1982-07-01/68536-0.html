        [1] This fixer-upper was found in an expensive neighborhood, and-when finished-should have a resale value of more than $250,000. [2] Remodeling windows... [3] putting in new tile, and... [4] adding on a bay window sunspace are all cosmetic repairs that can be taken care of at relatively low cost. But a house requiring major renovations such as... [5] new electrical wirings or... [6] chimney repair may prove to be a budget-breaker. Follow the ""Rehabber's Checklist"" to avoid these pitfalls.
