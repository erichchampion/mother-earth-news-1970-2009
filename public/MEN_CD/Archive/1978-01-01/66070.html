                      <p>      It you've ever tried to fabricate one of those tables made      from a massive slab of log you know there's more than meets      the eye to the project. That is: A thick and imposing slice      of wood cut diagonally from most tree trunks may look as      solid as granite the day it's buzzed out . . . but there's      almost a 100% chance that it'll warp, crack-even      "explode"-as its fibers dry and shrink.    </p>        <p>      Ah, but there's a very simple "trade secret" known to the      folks - such as Rey Sheldon of Marlboro, Vermont      (shown here) - who make this kind of furniture for a      living. A secret guaranteed to keep those beauteous, burly      cross-sections of timber from cracking after you've worked      with them.    </p>    <p>      The secret? Cut your slabs only from old hardwood logs that      have lain out in the woods so long that mushrooms have      started to grow on them. No one really quite knows why, but      mushrooms growing on a dead and downed tree trunk seems to      be a near-infallible indication that the log has already      naturally cured wall past the warping and cracking stage.    </p>    <p>      Another point: Once a tree has been down long enough for      ground fungi to grow on it, the splintered end of its trunk      will probably have rotted so much that you can poke a      finger right through that part of the wood. Don't lot the      fact discourage you. Chances are good that this is only      another sign that the main body of the log is just starting      to really cure well. Use a crosscut or chain saw to slice      out the lengthwise slab or oval that you want. It the wood      is solid-not rotted or punky - all the way through      where you make your cut, it doesn't really matter what the      log looks like on its end.    </p>    <p>      Take your slab of wood home and-just to make sure-lot it      age in a dry place at room temperature for an additional      two months. If it hasn't cracked by that time, it probably      ain't ever gonna. That's your signal to get down to work.    </p>    <p>      Pry the bark off the slice of timber and dig out whatever      rot may have started around its edges. It there are any      minor checks or small breaks in the wood's surface that      won't show on the finished piece of furniture, you can fill      them with epoxy that has been tinted with brown shoe polish      or some other coloring. It the checks will show, save some      of the finest sanding dust from the project, strain and      sift it, and then mix the dust with clear Krylon. Apply      this filler in thin layers and let it dry for a full day      between coats.    </p>    <p>      Test the filled breaks with a fingernail and, when they're      hard enough, begin working the surfaces of your slab of      hardwood with a sander. (Start with an old disk, beft, or      pad of rather coarse paper and - as they wear out and      clog upwork your way down to a very fine grade of      sandpaper.)    </p>    <p>      Seal the sanded wood with any good commercial wood sealer.      If it raises the grain, sand the wood again with a fine      paper and apply another coat of the sealer. Continue this      alternating operation until your tabletop is "as slick as a      duck's beef" . . . then wax its surface with a true paste      wax. Let the wood soak up the paste for a few days, then      wax it again. The glossy-smooth finish should now be      permanent.    </p>        <p>      Slab tables and stools look best when their legs are put on      at splayed out" angles . . . and the bigger the table, the      more those legs should splay. Experiment a little. Try      different logs and different angles before you make a final      decision. Although you'll probably wind up slanting the      legs about four to five degrees . . . you'll never know      exactly what suits you best until you try a variety of      ideas.    </p>    <p>      Most lumberyards and a good many hardware stores stock      ready-made birch, maple, and cherry logs for just this kind      of project. Or you can carve, whittle, or turn your own      logs on a lathe if you prefer . . . depending on the tools      and hardwood you have at your disposal.    </p>    <p>      Try legs 17 inches long for a cocktail table and 22-inchers      for an end table. The best way to mount 'am is by simply      drilling holes into the underside of the slab top that the      upper ends of the supports will just fit into snugly . . .      and then hammer 'em in, That way there's no messy glue or      screws that can get lost to tool with and the legs can be      removed for moving and storage.    </p>
