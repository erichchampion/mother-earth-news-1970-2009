Back in 1948 he began      collecting information on low-cost, simple and natural      construction materials and techniques. He combed the world      for ideas, tried them and started writing about his      experiments.    </p>    <p>      Eventually, Mildred Loomis started publishing Kern's      articles in THE INTERPRETER, WAY OUT and GREEN REVOLUTION.      Ken has also issued a three-year series of pieces (called      TECHNIC) on his own and a greenhouse-sun pit design of his      has been featured in ORGANIC GARDENING.    </p>    <p>      This series of Ken Kern's work is being taken both from      OWNER-BUILT HOME (already published) and OWNER-BUILT      HOMESTEAD (to be published). To give you advance chapters      of HOMESTEAD as they are written I have to break my      presentation of HOME on an irregular basis for which I      apologize. If you want HOME all at once it's available      right now direct from Ken Kern, Sierra Route, Oakhurst,      California 93644 for $10.00.    </p>    <p>      -MOTHER    </p>		</div>    <p>      There comes a <em>moment of truth</em> in the life of every      potential homesteader. That is, sooner or later one finds      that he or she must come to grips with the purpose and      motivation and inner feelings associated with desire to      work the land. This chapter on soil management seems an      appropriate juncture to qualify some of these subjective      aspects. For one thing, soil is basic to the whole      homesteading complex: the person who lacks some special      feeling for the soil is not likely to have much feeling for      plant or animal husbandry.    </p>    <p>      Soil management practices, moreover, can prove to be      essential tests by which one can judge rapport with the      growing process. What is your reaction, for instance, when      giant machinery opens up soil furrows, denuding all      vegetation for planting monoculture crops to be sprayed      with deadly chemicals? Your moment of truth has arrived      when you are able to correlate a plow-sliced furrow with a      body slash; a denuding of ground cover with a peeling-off      of one's skin; an application of commercial fertilizer with      habitual injection of barbiturates.    </p>    <p>      If such feelings for the soil are alien to the average      homesteader, it is probably due to the fact that the      average homesteader has no comprehension of the exceedingly      bad soil management practices engaged in by modern farming.      Nor, conversely, does he understand the principles inherent      in <em>proper</em> soil management practices.    </p>    <p>      To achieve this understanding, the place to begin is with      an investigation of a sample of good soil and a sample of      poor soil. In the first instance, soil granules, or crumbs,      are aggregated into a structural unity. A disaggregated      soil, however, has no structure. Instead, pores are      completely filled with water. The soil surface dissolves      into mud after the first rain, and after the rain it dries      to a powdery dust. When you become able to appreciate the      intricacies of soil structure, you are well on the way to      an appreciation of food production itself.    </p>    <p>      An ideal soil structure is one having large and stable      pores which extend from the surface to the sub-soil strata.      The size and arrangement of soil particles govern the flow      and storage of water, the movement of air, and the ability      of the soil to supply nutrients to the plants. A ready      supply of air is especially necessary so that soil organic      matter can be decomposed by aerobic bacteria. Spaces around      soil particles also act as channels for conducting water      through the soil. About one-half the volume of soil should      consist of these soil pores and fissures. Many of these      spaces are filled with micro-fauna: the gums and mucilages      formed in the microfauna breakdown of organic matter helps      to bind soil particles together.    </p>    <p>      Now observe the sample of earth that comes from the average      farm. Tillage and clean cultivation drastically reduce the      number of large pores available for the movement of air and      water through the soil. Overcropping and monoculture also      weaken soil structure. The cultivation of annual crops      creates mechanical, chemical, and biological demands on the      soil all of which cause the soil to lose its crumb      structure.    </p>        <p>      A revolution against "farm implements"-great      destroyers of soil structure-is long overdue. When      Jethro Tull invented the moldboard plow, he said "tillage      is manure". But we now know that soil tilth is created by      decay, not by implements. The primary reason pioneer      farmers plowed was to get rid of weeds: when weeds were      plowed under the farmer had time to get his forage crop      started before wild vegetation recovered from the plowing      setback. Plowing cuts loose, then granulates, and finally      inverts slices of earth on top of surface organic matter.      As a result, bare soil is exposed to the direct eroding      action of wind and rain (soil aggregates are badly      destroyed through the beating action of rain). In this      manner, plowing (as well as other forms of tillage) breaks      down the soil structure and leaves the surface liable to      crusting, The small pore size associated with surface crust      increases the water runoff by restricting water intake,      which thereby reduces the amount of moisture stored for      future crop use.    </p>    <p>      As far as I am aware, there are <em>no</em> suitable      tillage implements: all destroy soil aggregates-some      more than others! For one thing, when surface moisture is      just right for tillage, the subsoil moisture content (being      higher) is in prime state for maximum compaction. Equipment      compaction takes place throughout the whole process of crop      production-from planting and cultivating to      harvesting. Excessive compaction of moist soil limits water      absorption by limiting the supply of highly essential      oxygen. Compacted soils, like soggy-wet soils, hinder      germination because much oxygen is required to digest the      stored foods in seeds. In the germination process, carbon      dioxide is given off and a maximum pore space is essential,      as the gaseous interchange around the germinating seed must      be maintained. Furthermore, the pore spaces must be      contiguous-from subsoil to atmosphere. In this way      the carbon dioxide can be dissolved with moisture in the      surface layers (by capillary attraction) forming carbonic      acid. This acid is the most efficient natural solvent of      minerals, releasing (in particular) phosphorus and potash      for the plant use.    </p>    <p>      Organic gardening magazines probably receive more revenue      from hand-operated rotary plow, like the "Rototiller", ads      than from the balance of all other advertisements. Ads that      sell these machines to unsuspecting gardeners are just one      more example of the innocence flawing the "organic"      movement. No amount of organically-produced compost could      even begin to compensate for the total destruction of soil      structure which these machines deliver. Rototillers are the      worst type of tillage implements: soil is not merely cut      and turned over, it is <em>sheared to dust.</em> Powdery      soils will cake and crust upon wetting and drying.      Furthermore, the sharp tines completely destroy such      essential soil microflora as algae-which keeps      microbes supplied with greens through the production of      chlorophyll.    </p>    <p>      In my judgment, <em>mulch planting</em> has been proven to      be the best soil-building alternative to tillage..      Practical mulch planting techniques will be discussed in      following <em>PLANT MANAGEMENT</em> chapters; our only      interest at this point is how mulch planting aids in the      development of soil structure and fertility. Obviously,      fiberizing the land with organic matter prevents surface      compaction and crusting. Furthermore, this organic matter      gradually decays, and in so doing releases carbon dioxide.      As we have seen, the carbon dioxide combines with      water-forming carbonic acid, which in turn releases      essential nutrients from parent subsoil minerals. As the      decay process continues, microbial activity leaves a      residue of gelatinous and filamentous growth which acts as      a collodial complex, drawing particles together into      structural aggregations. Again, as we have seen, the      aggregation structure acts as a conduit, connecting upper      soil layers with the subsoil. Organic matter therefore acts      as a regulator of air and water in the soil: <em>the      foundation of productive land is based on the organic      content of the soil</em> . Force roots, not tillage tools,      through the soil.    </p>    <p>      Mulch planting does even more for soil structure: it sets      the stage for the creation of humus. Humus is as important      to soil as it is difficult for a person to understand. S.      A. Waksman's major work on humus runs to over 500 pages!      Farmers in past centuries believed that humus was directly      utilized as basic plantfood by crops. Liebig, father of      commercial fertilizer, disproved this, showing that plant      growth was dependent upon inorganic compounds. Organic      matter is fertile only after it is broken down into      inorganic forms. However, to depart from Liebig's      conclusion, inorganic compounds are made available by      <em>microbes in a humus medium</em> and not, as he      proposed, applied externally as plant-food!    </p>    <p>      Humus is organic matter in its decomposed state. It      contains the breakdown products and dead bodies of      microorganisms-which give humus its characteristic      dark color. It is these microorganisms, dying in the humus      layer, which slowly decompose organic matter, thereby      liberating and making soluble continuous streams of carbon      dioxide, nitrogen (in the form of ammonia), phosphorus, and      other elements. The gelatinous and filamentous residues      give humus the property that binds soil particles into      structural aggregations; and this structural aggregation of      soil is the most favorable medium for the development of      root systems and for the future growth of microbes.      Aeration and water-holding capacity is increased: the soil      is able to absorb more heat. Heat is also given off as a      result of air circulation through humus-especially in      light sandy soil where air moves freely as water drains      away quickly. More organic matter must therefore be      supplied to sandy soil than to clay or silt soils, to      prevent this "burning up" of humus.    </p>        <p>      Humus is a veritable storehouse of nutrients. It is also a      cementing agent, binding constituent soil aggregations      together: one pound of soil colloidal particles is said to      cover five acres of surface. Humus has functions and      qualities unknown by modern science: Waksman mentions that      when all extractions have been made by known processes      there is still 30% of the humus unaccounted for. The most      important adage that comes from a study of humus is that      <em>growth equals decay:</em> the growing season must      necessarily also be the decaying season.    </p>    <p>      There's another adage that every homesteader should      memorize: <em>proper soil management is the care and      feeding of bacteria.</em> Microbes are vital to the      decomposition of organic and mineral wastes into basic      plant nutrients. And, of the microbes that inhabit the      soil, 99% are bacteria. The rest consist of fungi,      protozoa, and algae. Bacteria are divided into aerobic      those which thrive under conditions of abundant oxygen      - and anaerobic bacteria, which live in conditions      where oxygen has been used up; that is, where pore spaces      are filled up with carbonic acid and water.    </p>    <p>      Activities of soil bacteria populations are fantastic: one      type produces antibiotics; one type digests proteins (most      important of which is nitrogen); other types gather      nitrogen from the air. These latter bacteria live in      nodules on the roots of certain legume plants. Nitrogen gas      is extracted from the atmosphere and made available to the      host plant in return for carbohydrates. Another, even more      amazing, type of bacteria lives in association with the      feeder roots of certain plants - for mutual benefit:      the plant is able to assimilate mineral nutrients more      readily.    </p>    <p>      Earthworms are always included, usually at top priority, in      any discussion of soil microbe population. Actually, in      comparison with the soil development accomplished by      bacteria, earthworms are pikers! At best, earthworms are      <em>indicators</em> of good soil fertility, not its cause.      Darwin overstated the case for the ubiquitous worm: they      have no mechanism for creating plant food, capturing solar      energy, or fixing nitrogen from the air. Earthworm      "aeration" of the soil is insignificant, and the "richness"      of earthworm casting is just one snore organic gardener      myth. In reality, the earthworm reduces soil fertility to      the extent that it burns up energy passed off as carbon      dioxide. The leafy diet of earthworms is especially low in      mineral nutrients.    </p>    <p>      Compost is another organic gardening myth worth exploring      in this chapter on soil management. A massive literature on      compost making has been compiled by ORGANIC GARDENING AND      FARMING editor J. I. Rodale <em>(THE COMPLETE BOOK OF      COMPOSTING; 1971;</em> 1,000 pages!), and compost making      has traditionally been the farming criterion separating the      good guys from the bad guys. In reality, mulch planting is      a complete, integral process, requiring no further      additives in the form of soil conditioners, amendments, or      fertilizers. Organic matter applied in mulch planting is      utilized in its entirety, without gaseous loss as is the      case whey making a separate compost pile. Mulch planting      seems to call for a "sheet. compost" program, where organic      matter is spread directly on the ground surface. The only      real advantage of centralized composting is where hip      excrement is utilized. More on this will appear in      subsequent chapters.    </p>    <p>      Whether one adds compost, or any form of fertilizer, to a      soil principle of <em>soil replenishment</em> remains the      same, and has little to do with soil structure. Given an      adequately based organic content, however, the soil microbe      population can create its own nutrient demands in a soil      structure that is compatible to the needs of these      microbes. Experiments at the New Jersey Agricultural      Experiment Station disclosed the fact that fresh residues      applied on an equal organic matter basis produced as much      as three times the soil aggregation as did composts      prepared from the same material. Obviously an "applied"      nutrient - whether it be humus-rich compost or      commercial fertilizer - cannot have the same      influence on soil structure as a more indigenous organic      treatment.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, the indiscriminate application of      fertilizers can have a <em>harmful</em> effect on crops: if      a little nitrogen added to the soil is good, a whole lot      added is not necessarily better! An excess of one      fertilizing element in the soil may lead to a deficiency of      another. Too much nitrogen leads to a deficiency of      potassium; too much potash leads to a deficiency of      magnesium. Excessive nitrogen added to the soil may      over-stimulate the growth of leaves and stems and interfere      with seed formation. There are good arguments against the      use of commercial fertilizers which are applied at the time      seed is planted: the fertilizer supplies soluble salts for      plant nutrition at the very time when the seed is equipped      with its own stored-up organic supply. The solubility of      commercial fertilizers is much too high in most instances      (phosphate rock is treated with sulfuric acid to make it      even more available to plants). As soon as plant roots      reach these soluble chemicals they go into a spasmodic      growth spree, which in turn upsets the delicate soil      balance.    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen is the most important of all fertilizer elements      required for plant growth: it regulates directly a plant's      ability to make <em>protein.</em> Large amounts of nitrogen      are needed, especially at early stages of plant growth, and      also because so much nitrogen is lost to the atmosphere as      gas, or from the soil through leaching. Pre-agribusiness      farmers used to leave their fields in rough-stubble      throughout the winter months to facilitate rapid snow and      rain penetration into the soil, thereby minimizing nitrogen      loss from the sky. All nitrogen comes from the air: it is      returned to the atmosphere at the same constant rate that      it is removed from the air.    </p>    <p>      Other elements besides nitrogen can be recovered from the      air. Field sorrel, for instance, is an extra-heavy user of      phosphorous. It can supply itself even though a chemical      analysis where it grows reveals no phosphorous present.      Unlimited quantities of minerals are also present in the      soil and these essential nutrients are made available to      the crop in a properly structured soil aggregation.    </p>    <p>      Mineral nutrients can be "locked in" - made not      available - when the soil structure is compacted,      waterlogged, or where insufficient moisture prevails.      Raising or lowering the acidity of a soil can have a major      influence on soil nutrients. Raising the pH of an acid soil      from 5.5 to 6.4 (making it more alkaline) increases the      availability of phosphorous about ten times. And reducing      the pH of alkaline soil from 8.3 to 6.9 (making it less      alkaline) increases phosphorous availability 500%. The pH      (literally, parts-of-hydrogen) refers to the balance of      acidity alkalinity. The scale extends from 10 (high      alkalinity) to 4 (high acidity). Most plants thrive at a pH      range of 6.0 to 6.9. At this range bacteria seem to thrive,      thereby speeding the decay of organic matter and the      liberation of nitrogen. At a pH below 6.0 only those      bacteria which break organic matter into an inferior      ammonia are active; at higher pH the breakdown produces      more valuable nitrate nitrogen.    </p>        <p>      A quartz, granite, sandstone, or shale parent soil usually      produces an acid topsoil, whereas marble and limestone      produce alkaline soil. Ground limestone is traditionally      applied to reduce soil acidity. If available, use dolomite      limestone as it contains magnesium carbonate as well as      calcium carbonate. Magnesium is an important soil      amendment. If a soil is too alkaline, apply sulfur or      gypsum. It is the <em>oxidation</em> of sulfur that reduces      alkalinity. And organic matter encourages sulfur oxidation,      which further illustrates the importance organic matter      plays in soil management practices. A light, sandy soil      - or one highly weathered - requires less      amounts of soil amendment to lower or raise pH than heavy      clay soils or soils high in organic content. Usually      gardeners use either too much or too little lime: at      Cornell University several hundred home gardens were      analyzed: one-third had too much lime, one-third had too      little, and one-third were just right.    </p>    <p>      Most states have agricultural experiment stations and      extension services which will test one's soil for lime and      fertilizer requirements. Or one may prefer to do his own      testing, using an inexpensive soil-test kit. Purdue      University makes the best deal for a soil and plant tissue      test kit: a complete setup for $13.75.    </p>    <p>      Soil for testing should be taken 6 inches deep, where most      crop roots live. It is important to keep soil moist several      days before testing as drought affects pH by killing      bacteria. Also a cold soil inactivates bacteria: so, in      order to get a fair pH reading, test warm, moist soil. When      using the kit to test for mineral requirements, remember      that the availability of soil nutrients varies from day to      day and from season to season. In the early spring, for      instance, nitrogen is taken up by soil organisms, so on      this basis a false reading will be made. Also a single soil      sample would not necessarily be typical of the whole      homestead. A farm usually has from 3 to 6 types of soils      - there are tens of thousands different soil types in      the U.S.    </p>    <p>      Actually, to classify soils into "types" - like      Chernogen, Podzol, Prairie, etc. - is rather      misleading as well as being unimportant. In the early      farming days, before the destruction of topsoil and humus      by bad farm practices, soils were made up of thick, black      layers of organic matter. And in this respect the part of      the soil that was important was the same as any other soil.      It is only since denuding the soil of this black mantle      that the underlying sandwich layers became discernible and      classifiable.    </p>    <p>      The most important thing that one should know about the      soil he works with is the <em>texture</em> of the soil      aggregations. That is, whether it is of clay, silt, sand,      or gravel texture. As noted in the previous chapter on      water management, water percolates rapidly through light      sandy soils. Clay soils have greater water storage      capacity. Also, and more to our interests here, the finer      the texture a soil possesses the more nutrients are      available. Fine clay aggregations provide more clinging      surfaces whereas in sandy soils water and nutrients are      easily leached away. The sandier the soil, the less organic      matter it contains. On this type of soil it is imperative      to build up humus content so that the filamentous and      gelatinous residues of crop refuse will fill up spaces      around sand particles and thereby overcome excessive      drainage and leaching - and the rapid conversion of      organic matter into carbon dioxide and water.    </p>    <p>      Inasmuch as soil is created primarily by the growth of      plants, the best soil improvement method is to <em>grow      crops.</em> A soil aggregation of heavy clay or silt      particles can therefore best be lightened or made more      friable by growing weeds or green manures. A green manure      is a crop grown and returned to the soil for purposes of      improving the soil. Besides the surface mulch that is made      available, roots from green manure crops penetrate deep.      When they die and decompose a water conduit is provided      through which excess water can drain from the clay subsoil,      and down which the roots of the next crop can grow more      easily.    </p>    <p>      Extremely poor, eroded, and structureless soil can be made      productive by using green manuring principles: first apply      necessary lime; then commercial nitrate fertilizer; then      turn the land to weeds. The weeds will thrive on the      applied nutrients and penetrate the subsoil with their      highly developed root systems. Mineral nutrients will be      brought to the surface through the roots of these weeds.      Some grasses and legumes will thrive on poor soils; for      instance, buckwheat, rye, lespedeza, and sweet clover.    </p>    <p>      There are other farming practices, crop rotation for      instance, which improve soil structure. A discussion of      these principles brings us to the subject content of the      next three chapters on Plant Management, so basic concepts      only will be listed:    </p>    <p>      1) Legume crops are grown to promote the fixation of      nitrogen from the air.<br />      2) Perennial grasses, in a grass arable pasture system, are      grown to supply a constant source of humus.<br />      3) The alternation of deep and shallow rooted crops      prevents continual absorption of nutrients from the same      zone.<br />      4) Deep rooted plants (like alfalfa) improve subsoil      structure when roots decay.<br />      5) Keep a cover crop growing during winter months for      protection against wind and rain. Always remember: let the      surface of the soil wear a beard.<br />      6) Grow green manure crops between regular growing seasons      for producing organic matter.    </p>    <p>      Admittedly, this chapter on soil management fails to even      mention some of the issues which are considered paramount      in most textbook treatments on the subject. This is not an      oversight on the part of the author: only that material      which is pertinent to the development and maintenance of      soil structure has been considered at this time.    </p>    <h3>      THE OWNER-BUILT HOME, VOLUME 3, CHAPTER 3<br />      WALLS    </h3>    <p>      Man's first wall was built as a stockade around his      village. Its function was to protect from intruders and to      contain livestock. In the evolution of house forms, herders      de-emphasized the importance of the hunter's roof-tent in      favor of wall embellishments based on the village stockade.      First, he drove posts into the ground and wove wattle in      between. Later, he pressed stiff mud into the wattle      - a direct predecessor of our ever-popular suburban      "half-timber" style.' Finally, a few thousand years before      Christ, the wall builders invented the brick, which      essentially brings us to the modern scene.    </p>    <p>      As contemporary man continues to place brick on brick to      form the wall - stockade around his "living" space,      he armors against life in much the same manner as his      pastoral ancestors. The function of walls for      <em>protection</em> persists even though the early pastoral      significance has been lost in our present non-pastoral      communities. Some self-conscious design reformers later      succeeded in disturbing these notions when they started the      bring-the-outdoors-in campaign. Result; the picture-window      became a stock item and indoor planters defied the      "outside" feeling as much as the concrete patio did the      "inside" feeling.    </p>    <p>      It's about time we re-examine the wall in terms of purpose      and function. A house can be thought of as having many      purposes; but primarily it is a contrivance for regulating      (controlling) a segment of our environment. This      conditioned environment is enclosed with roof, floor and      walls so that weather factors such as air movement,      humidity, precipitation, temperature, and light may be      regulated. Walls are structural membranes separating the      indoor environment from the outdoor environment. On the      other hand, the greater the difference between the indoors      and the outdoors, the more elaborate must be the wall's      inherent properties. The more important characteristics      which a wall must have include strength and durability,      flow-control (heat, moisture and air), and good design at      low cost. These are the more significant properties that      will concern us in this chapter.    </p>    <p>      Generally speaking, about one-half of the cost of a house      is the cost of the materials which go into it, the      remainder being labor costs. With this fact in mind one      would naturally assume that builders would have a thorough      knowledge of the nature and properties of all building      material possibilities. The functional performance of a      wall material is number one consideration, but at the same      time the most economic solution requires a selection of      components having the lowest combination of <em>initial      cost</em> and maintenance. This long-range cost is too      often overlooked by builders in their concern with how much      money must be raised in the beginning.    </p>    <p>      Among the many considerations for selection and evaluation      of wall materials, listed below in order of importance. I      would certainly include a seemingly far fetched <em>salvage      value.</em> Cheaper and easier demolition becomes      significant in this era when the average useful life of a      building is comparatively short. Plywood paneling and heavy      timber framing have high salvage values; brick and concrete      have low salvage values.    </p>    <p>      <em>Check List for the Selection of Wall Materials</em>    </p>    <p>      1. initial cost and subsequent maintenance cost.<br />      2. compressive and traverse strength.<br />      3. resistance to natural weathering, chemical attack and      atmospheric pollution.<br />      4. combustibility.<br />      5. ease of handling (size, weight, shape) and      erection.<br />      6. resistance to scratching and impact.<br />      7. dimensional changes with temperature and moisture      content changes.<br />      8. susceptibility to insect attack.<br />      9. appearance in color and texture.<br />      10. moisture penetration resistance.<br />      11. sound insulation and absorption.<br />      12. adaptability to future changes of layout and salvage      value.    </p>    <p>      Wall materials must have the necessary strength in      compression, bending, shear and tension to carry applied      loads and to resist such external pressures as wind loads.      Accurate strength properties of the material must be known      before one can economically design a wall. In the design      analysis it is important to remember that the loads in      question apply only to the net width of the wall, excluding      door and window openings. From a design standpoint this      would suggest greater consolidation of openings and      adequately spaced, solid wall panels to provide bracing      effect. Types of bracing and methods of fastening are the      main factors which influence the strength and rigidity of a      wall.    </p>    <p>      The durability of a wall is more dependent on heat flow      (temperature change) and moisture than any other factors.      Moisture deterioration can take place in all organic      building materials, as such materials are      hygroscopic-absorbing moisture from the air in proportion      to relative humidity. Dimensional change in a wall      primarily causes weakness and failure of fastening members.      Practically all wall materials change their dimensions      according to whether they are wet or dry. When a wet      material is dried, shrinkage occurs; when the material      becomes wet again, expansion takes place. But the      subsequent expansion is often less than the initial      contraction, leading to irreversible expansion. Swelling      and shrinking due to moisture-changes also causes a      breakdown of surface finishes. The pore structure of      organic wall materials easily permits capillary moisture      attraction from the atmosphere. As much as 40% of the dry      weight of a material can be taken up and held with water.      This is to say nothing of direct moisture contact from rain      or melting snow.    </p>    <p>      Wall moisture originating from within the building can be      an even more damaging factor than outside penetration. As      the inside temperature increases, inside water vapor is      transmitted into the wall and there condenses. This      <em>condensation</em> results in wetting of structural      materials and consequent loss of insulating qualities. It      also gives rise to such serious problems as chemical,      physical or biological deterioration of the materials      (corrosion of metal, spalling of brick, rotting of timber).    </p>    <p>      In wood-frame walls a <em>vapor barrier</em> will control      inside condensation. But in masonry walls the vapor barrier      prevents moisture from entering the room, and consequently,      moisture condenses behind the moisture barrier as the hot      summer sun follows a rain, driving moisture inside the      wall. Waterproofing the outside of a masonry wall will      prevent moisture migrations from the <em>outside,</em> but      this same waterproofing causes a build-up and damming of      water by condensation from the inside. In short, a wall      must be designed to limit this entry of water from the      outside via capillarity and at the same time permit the      flow of water vapor to the outside in winter. But the      outside wall should have a partial capacity for water      storage, separated capillarity-wise from the inside wall.      Furthermore, the transfer of vapor to the inside in summer      should be controlled by venting. Obviously, the best choice      for a masonry wall is one of the vented-cavity type. Where      insulation is used as well as a vapor barrier, a higher      indoor humidity is possible without the occurrence of      surface condensation. However, incorrect use of thermal      insulation can increase the danger of condensation. It can      increase temperatures on the warm side of the wall thereby      decreasing temperatures on the cold side and causing      condensation towards the cold side of the wall.    </p>        <p>      In the wall-material literature one finds ample reference      and speculation on the "wonder" material which satisfies      all the requirements of an inexpensive, durable, strong,      simply constructed wall. Realistically, this ideal material      should also exhibit no thermal expansion, no moisture      expansion, be impermeable to moisture, and resistant to      heat flow. Also there are summer moisture-heat-gain and      winter moisture-heat-loss factors to balance out, so it is      quite unlikely that such a miracle product exists or could      ever be inexpensively manufactured.    </p>    <p>      The more practical approach to wall building is for the      owner-builder first to plan his walls in relation to areas      for winter functions and summer functions, daytime use and      nighttime use, inside partitions and outside exposure,      bearing walls and curtain walls, storm sides and sunny      sides. Our practice of building all four walls of a house      of equal thickness and insulation is absolutely absurd. The      nighttime, sleeping areas certainly have opposite      requirements from daytime, living areas.    </p>    <p>      The thermal performance of a wall is determined by its (a)      degree of direct solar heat penetration through windows,      (b) absorptiveness of the exposed surface to solar      radiation, (c) heat-storing capacity, (d) insulation      characteristics, (e) ventilation rate. Heavyweight wall      materials like tamped earth are cool during the day and      warm during the night in regions where <em>the daily      variation in outdoor air temperature and solar radiation      are great.</em> But in regions where the daily outdoor      temperature variations are small but solar radiation      intensities high, such heavyweight wall materials do not      permit sufficient cooling off during the night for      comfortable sleeping. In such regions, lightweight      materials should be used.    </p>        <p>      Another gross extravagance in the home building industry is      the use of heavyweight materials in non-load-bearing      partitions. This is an example of a builder's failure to      select a wall material from the point of view of purpose      and requirements as well as availability and other economic      considerations. An interior, non-load-bearing wall      certainly does not require even similar properties as does      an outside supporting wall.    </p>    <p>      Wall materials in a house should be as varied as window      sizes or roof coverings. The success or failure of a wall      design-and the completed house as well-is      determined by the degree to which the builder relates the      wall material to inside and outside environment. A wall is      a sort of transition between these two environments; it can      express this function with insensitivity or by a statement      of simple logic. When peppered with openings and      conflicting materials, a wall lacks clarity and      composition. Of all that man has created, simplicity of      structure is a constant characteristic of the finest. You      can get a unified design by reducing the number of      materials used, by consolidating the areas and spaces      within. You can simplify linear design by extending lines      both horizontally and vertically-resulting in a neat,      uncluttered silhouette. Simplicity means balance in form,      scale, texture and color. Simple structure also means      economy. All this is to tell the owner-builder that      structure is effective as it satisfies your human need. Set      your reasoning to get the simplest, most effective means      possible. Immerse yourself in this economy-of-means. After      a while you will not have to <em>think</em> effectiveness      and balance. It will become part of your nature, with your      actions taking place on a more intuitive, non-verbal,      non-intellectual level.    </p>        <p>      <strong>BIBLIOGRAPHY</strong> (books listed in order of importance)<br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Fundamental Considerations in Design of Exterior      Walls:</em> Hutcheon, Div.of Building Research, National      Research Council, Ottawa, Canada.<br />      <em>Guides to Improved Framed Walls:</em> Forest Products      Lab., Madison, Wis. <em><br />      Condensation in Building Walls:</em> Structural Clay      Products Institute, A.I.A.
