                   <h5 id="byline">by  VICTOR A. CROLEY</h5>        <p>      Enthusiastic gardeners have long insisted that "poke      sallet" would take the place of spinach and other garden      greens if only it could be easily gown from seed. Wherever      it is found it the wild-and that includes a very      large portion of the country-pokeweed provides the      most sought-after tender spring greens, first choice of all      knowledgeable connoisseurs and gourmets. Will domesticating      it bring wider popularity and perhaps market as a garden      vegetable? Well, we're going to see whether the old      prophecy will come true because scientists at the      University of Arkansas Experiment Station have finally      unlocked the secrets of the pokeberry and discovered how to      increase and speed up its germination so that it is now      comparable with other garden seeds.    </p>    <p>      Of course in poke country not many have waited for this      great day for it has long been known that poke greens can      be tamed and brought into the family garden just by digging      up a few clumps of the old roots after the plant had gone      dormant in the fall and replanting them along a fence row      where they can grow and flourish undisturbed by the plow.    </p>    <p>      Pokeweed ( <em>Phytolacca americana</em> ) is a hardy      perennial through most of the middle and southern states.      It likes rich soil with plenty of moisture, humus and      organic matter der ideal conditions it will grow to      shrub-like proportions, six feet tall with branches      spreading over an equal area. Given room, polk is an      attractive plant with dark green leaves brightened at      almost every axile by a tassel of yellowish white blossoms.      The blooms are followed by clusters of berries that change      from green to red and finally turn a rich, royal dark      purple in the fall.    </p>    <p>      It is these berries that give pokeweed its less familiar      name of "Inkberry." During the Civil War many a letter home      was written by a soldier boy who fashioned his own quill      from a wild turkey wing feather and squeezed the juice from      ripe pokeberries to provide the ink. Some of these letters,      legible as the day they were written, can be found in      museums today, attesting to the permanence and enduring      qualities of inkberry juice.    </p>    <p>      A bush burdened with colorful polkberries in autumn is a      most pleasing sight, and the fruit is loved by a host of      birds-including the robin, mockingbird, brown      thrasher, blue jay, catbird, quail and others. There are      millions and billions of seeds-fifty or more in every      berry-pounds on every plant. What a bountiful feast      to spread before our feathered songsters! Seeing a      berry-laden bush in autumn and realizing that each      individual berry is packed with tiny seeds fills one with      awe and amazement at the prodigality of Nature . . . and      her downright wastefulness. Poke is never a common weed and      seldom takes over or becomes much of a nuisance simply      because so few of the billions of seeds produced each year      can find conditions suitable for germination ad growth.    </p>    <p>      The hard-coated, obstinate poke seed must pass through the      alimentary canal of a bird or animal to soften and prepare      it for germination. In this process the seed is subject to      prolonged heat for a bird's normal body temperature may be      as high as 106 degrees. At the same time the seeds are at      the mercy of the harsh action of powerful digestive juices      containing strong acids and the scarifying process of      peristalsis. The few seeds that escape complete digestion,      then, account for the comparative scarcity of poke plants.    </p>    <p>      To solve the problem of germinating pokeweed, scientists      learned to soak the seed for exactly five minutes in      concentrated sulphuric acid (technical grade). 'The seeds      are completely submerged in the solution, and at the end of      the soaking period they are washed quickly and thoroughly      in running water to stop the action and remove all traces      of acid. Seed treated in this manner germinates at the rate      of 80 to 90 percent in two weeks' time, while untreated      seed in a test plot showed only 40 percent germination      after six weeks or longer.    </p>    <p>      Spring crops of poke greens are produced by planting seed      about the same time as spinach. Commercial plantings in the      south are handled as an established perennial crop like      asparagus. Only one cutting of greens is made during the      first year in the field. In the second growing season three      cuttings are made; in mid-May, early June and late June.      Until the plants have heavy root systems and are well      established, extensive cutting may easily destroy them.      North of the Mason-Dixon Line poke is not reliably      perennial and probably should be treated as an annual,      making three or more cuttings and then plowing the stubble      under for green manure.    </p>    <p>      Young new growth, up to six inches high, and growing      through a light mulch of hay or leaves that blanches the      polk foliage to a pale green, offers the most tender and      delicate greens. Then the tender stalk up to half an inch      in diameter-but still delicate enough to snap at      finger touch-can be trimmed and served like      asparagus.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      Do not be tempted by its delicacy to use poke for salads in      a raw form. Uncooked pokeweed can be violently cathartic      and cause severe poisoning. Because poke is a tender      vegetable it should be cooked quickly in boiling water,      lightly salted, and served quickly with drawn butter and a      dash of lemon juice. The tender stalks are handled just      like asparagus and are especially good served on toast with      hollandaise or a mild cheese sauce.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      If you plan to harvest pokeweed seeds you should collect      the ripe berries in early August. Only fully ripened      berries should be picked. Place these in a crock or other      non-metallic container and crush them. The pulp should then      be allowed to ferment for three or four days. After this      period of fermentation, add water to separate the seeds      from the pulp and skin. Spread the washed seeds in a thin      layer on cheesecloth or a newspaper to dry. The clean, dry      seed can then be treated with acid and planted immediately      to provide fall and winter greens . . . or the dry seed may      be held in storage for spring planting.    </p>    <p>      Where pokeweed is a hardy perennial, well-rooted and      established plants are amazingly regenerative and      persistent. Under such conditions, the plant will produce      new growth even under extensive and severe cutting. For      fresh winter greens, the heavy root clumps can be lifted      and stored in a freeze-proof root cellar where they will      send up tender shoots in early spring, very like endive or      chicory.    </p>    <p>      Poke needs only light blanching before packaging and      storing in the freezer locker. It may also be canned and      preserved like spinach or mustard greens.    </p>    <p>      Do not use any part of the poke roots or seeds, as they are      said to be poisonous. Roots of old plants are coarse and      woody and would not be attractive in any case . . . but if      you're growing poke as an annual garden green, there is a      temptation to pull and use the whole plant, like beet      thinnings. It's better to be on the safe side. Cut off and      discard the root portions.    </p>
