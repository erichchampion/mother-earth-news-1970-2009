                       <h5 id="bbyline">by ROD CHADWICK</h5>    <p>      "Chicken Man" (England's Harold Bate) is already marketing      a kit which frees automobiles from the surly bonds of      gasoline by unleashing the power inherent in humble manure.      Now "Aqua Man", Spanish inventor Eduard Estevel, has      unveiled (Saturday, January 23rd., 1971) on European      television, an engine fueled . . . BY WATER.    </p>    <p>      No, not a steam engine, but a power unit FUELED by plain,      ordinary water. It works, according to the inventor, on a      principle of breaking down the water to the basic elements;      hydrogen as a combustion fuel and oxygen expelled through      the exhaust pipe. OXYGEN EXPELLED THROUGH THE EXHAUST      PIPE!!! Here is an invention then, which not only does not      pollute, but could actually dilute the fumes from other      engines a little, Whoever heard of an engine IMPROVING the      atmosphere!?    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, Senor Estevel claims 400 miles per gallon for      the automobile mounted version, and says that as a car      motor it could be mass-produced for only $25.    </p>    <p>      Now. Something has to be done before General Motors or      Standard Oil or somebody buys the whole thing up (      <em>assuming that it actually works-JS</em> ) and      kills it stone dead. The greatest of inventions all seem to      follow that route according to popular rumor.    </p>    <p>      So let this be an appeal for information; and even      exploitation. To anyone who knows someone in Spain, anyone      going to Spain and anyone with the resources to do      something about this; the message is: <strong>"LET US      KNOW".</strong>    </p>
