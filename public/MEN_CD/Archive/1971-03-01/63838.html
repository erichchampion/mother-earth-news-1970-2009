                   <p>      THROW AWAY YOUR TROWELS, POTS,<br />      STARTING FERTILIZERS AND POTTING SOILS, GANG.<br />      HERE'S A QUICK, EASY, NO MESS WAY TO AN EARLIER,<br />      HARDIER GARDEN. IT'S ALL ORGANIC, TOO, EXCEPT FOR<br />      THE PESKY "WRAPPER"... AND THE AUTHOR IS WO R KING THAT.    </p>    	  <h2 id="subtitle">start your garden early in peak pellets</h2>    <h5 id="byline">by JACK ROLAND COGGINS</h5>    <p>      I handed the nursery store salesman $11.59 and received      only a small box, light enough to carry under one arm, in      return. That little box, he assured me, contained all the      supplies I needed to start 250 garden plants indoors.    </p>    <p>      It was difficult to believe. I had gone to town that cold,      late winter morning intending to spend twenty dollars or      more on a long list of fertilizers, potting soil, peat      moss, sand, pots, trowels and other planting needs. I had      pictured myself carrying heavy bags to the basement, mixing      soil, filling containers, trying to keep track of numerous      accessories and doing extensive clean up after each      planting session.    </p>    <p>      Now, I felt cheated. All I had was this little box of      pellets, tiny discs of compressed peat held together with      plastic net stockings. No pots needed, no mixing, no messes      to clean up; just add water for-presto-a<br />      ready-to-plant, complete indoor growing environment.    </p>    <p>      Well, I'd see!    </p>    <p>      At home I went straight to the dining room table (instead      of the basement) and measured the pellets: A mere one and      three-quarters inches in diameter by about five-sixteenths      of an inch thick. Eight of the discs fit perfectly into      trays made by cutting half-gallon milk cartons in two,      lengthwise.    </p>    <p>      I added warm water to the pellets and, in about three      minutes, they had risen to a height of approximately two      inches. Well, what do you know. Convenience does have its      interesting moments even for gardeners who, like myself,      normally prefer the old-fashioned ways of doing things!    </p>    <p>      The blunt end of a ballpoint pen proved an excellent      instrument for pushing seed holes into the wet      nutrient-enriched peat. I easily placed tiny seeds into the      indentations-singly-by letting them adhere to      the wet end of a toothpick and brushing them off against      the peat. The wet peat was then pushed over each seed and      firmed down with the convex side of a dinner spoon.    </p>    <p>      In less than an hour, I had planted lettuce, cabbage,      broccoli, Brussels sprouts, Swiss chard, celery and      Alexandria strawberry seeds. Once again I felt cheated.      Here it was still morning and I was finished. There wasn't      even a mess to clean up! Then, I remembered. I had always      wanted to keep a detailed gardening journal, but could      never seem to find the time. Now, thanks to peat pellet      planting, I had the time.    </p>    <p>      I got out some labels (the kind you can stick on a surface      and, later remove easily without tearing). On each label I      listed the plants in a tray, the name of the seed company,      planting season for which the seeds were packed, the date      planted and the normal germination and maturity times. I      even looked up the most desirable germinating temperatures      and wrote them on the labels.    </p>          <p>      <em>Peat pellets provide time saving convenience and      effective results for folks who want to start their gardens      early. In the above photo dry, compressed pellets are      between containers and wet, planting-ready pellets are in      the trays made by cutting milk cartons in half      lengthwise.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Small disposable aluminum baking tins make ideal      planting trays for peat pellets, twelve pellets to each      container. Those shown at right below are dry, of course,      and the lefties are all puffed up with moisture just      a'waitin' for the seeds.</em><br />    </p>        <p>      Attached to the trays, these tags provided instant      identification and helpful information. Later they were      transferred to the pages of a composition notebook, one to      a page. Under each, I listed more data: Transplanting date,      size of plants when transplanted, watering and fertilizing      data, insects or diseases encountered and how handled,      actual date of maturity, and so on.    </p>    <p>      This journal has already proven priceless. It helps me in      realistic planning and aids in anticipating problems which      are incidental to my particular growing area and methods.      It provides specific nd down-to-earth information instead      of hazy rememberances, jumbled guesses and overbroad      generalizations.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, I was able to record that peat pellets are      great for starting plants indoors. My fifteen heads of      Tenderleaf lettuce were table-ready in early May and twelve      heads of Buttercrunch came on slightly later. Attributable      to perfect weather? No. Our area was close to two inches      below normal on rainfall and May brought more dry weather      and temperatures above ninety degrees!    </p>    <p>      My lettuce grew larger than I have ever grown it, too. At      full maturity, Tenderleaf (a fairly tight-bunch leaf      lettuce) spread to over fifteen inches and the Buttercrunch      showed a diameter of close to fourteen inches when standing      in the rows.    </p>    <p>      Such early (for this area) lettuce and good size can be      attributed-in part, at least-to the healthy      start given the plants by the peat pellets. Also, the      lettuce-again, thanks to the pellets-suffered      absolutely no setback at transplanting. The plants, peat      pellets and all, were simply slipped into prepared soil      where they continued to grow.    </p>    <p>      By mid-May, my pellet-started cabbage plants were also well      along in heading and we had already enjoyed fresh-cut Early      Spartan broccoli.    </p>    <p>      That's just a sampling of the fun I had with peat pellets.      For later plantings I sowed tomatoes, squash, melons,      cucumbers, ground cherries and similar warm weather crops      and the benefits really started to add up.    </p>         <p>      <em>The blunt end of a ballpoint pen (above) is an      excellent tool for pushing seed holes into the wet      pellets.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Even difficult-to-transplant garden fare-like      melons, squash and pumpkins-is easy with peat      pellets. Start `em indoors early and (below) transfer      pellet, plant and all at appropriate time. Roots are not      disturbed and plants continue to grow as if they'd been      outdoors all the time.</em><br />    </p>        <p>      Our hybrid Rushmore and Roma tomato plants blossomed in      mid-May and Pretty Patio tomato vines-not yet in      blossom-were of good size. These had been planted in      peat pellets on March 18 (it snowed that day) and      transplanted to open ground on May 2nd. They were protected      from frost once with large cans open at both ends, the tops      covered with plastic food bags and perforated( slightly for      ventilation.    </p>    <p>      Summer crookneck squash, planted in peat pellets on April      12 and transplanted into open ground on April 29, were over      a foot high by May 24. At this time the larger leaves      measured 9-inches plus and the total spread of individual      plants was well over 27 inches. These were protected. in      the same manner as the tomatoes, from late frost.    </p>    <p>      Even after cold weather (all during the summer in fact) I      continued using peat pellets. Hot and dry conditions that      summer made direct sowings of even larger seeds somewhat of      a problem. So, for late plantings of squash. cucumbers,      melons, pumpkins and the like, I planted seeds in peat      pellets and transplanted the sprouts to the hill without      setback. Since the peat pellets absorb water like a blotter      and since the medium is ideal for fast root growth, my      moisture problems were solved. As an added bonus, only two      or three seeds were required per hill, instead of the six      to eight normally sown in open ground planting.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes I'd place seeds in soaked peat pellets and set      them in the ground immediately, just covering the tops of      the pellets slightly with soil. The plants popped up in a      few days, robust and healthy, despite surrounding earth      that was merely dry-moist. Even if your ground cakes hard,      you can be assured of perfect emergence using this      technique.    </p>    <p>      When I knew a crop would be through in a week or two, I      used peat pellets to give new plantings a headstart. If      rains or dry weather delayed outdoor plantings, I      -again-started seeds in peat pellets. As a      result, the chance of insufficient growing period before      first frost was reduced.    </p>    <p>      Yes, I still believe that old-fashioned ways generally work      best but I don't object to space age techniques either.      Especially since peat pellets cut my planting costs, were      convenient, labor-saving . . . and helped assure an      earlier, healthier, more productive garden.    </p>        <p>      <em>Save and recycle those old tin cans and plastic food      bags. Photo above shows melons protected from frost by      large cans-open on both ends-covered with      plastic bags. Garbage? Bury it 8 to 12 inches deep in the      garden. It won't smell but it will quickly turn into the      best of plant foods.</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <em>Early Brussel sprouts, Spartan broccoli and half-mature      Tenderleaf lettuce . . . all were started indoors in peat      pellets to beat hot weather, drouth and bugs.</em>    </p>    	 <h3>AUTHOR'S NOTE</h3>    <p>      From an ecological point of view, peat pellets have one      obvious drawback-the plastic net stockings      surrounding the pressed peat. Surely, this netting could be      made of material that is easily dissolved through contact      with earth, air and moisture over a period of several      months.    </p>    <p>      There are two ways in which the ecologically-minded can      promote the use of materials which readily return to nature      through rapid breakdown: (1) They can ignore or boycott      products that contain ecologically unrealistic materials or      (2) They can attempt to salvage an otherwise useful product      by urging manufacturers to substitute ecologically-sound      materials for those which do not break down within a      reasonable period.    </p>    <p>      In the author's opinion, the peat pellet is a product which      deserves salvaging. Organic gardeners everywhere should      keep manufacturers informed of their interest in this item      while, at the same time, recommending ecol ogically-sound      improvements.    </p>   <h3>ABOUT THE AUTHOR</h3>    <p>      Jack Roland Coggins is a regular contributor of organic      gardening and ecology articles to national magazines. A      piece entitled "Our Family Fights Pollution" (written by      Jack and his wife, Dessie-Ellen) is in the March 1971 issue      of PARENTS' Magazine.    </p>    <p>      The Coggins family lives in Raymond, Nebraska (population      200) where, in addition to a backyard garden, they      "farm"-with emphasis on organic methods-an acre      of borrowed land. Jack says, "with the help of two large      home freezers, we enjoy healthful, homegrown food all      year."    </p>
