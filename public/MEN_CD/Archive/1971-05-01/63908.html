                		<p>      A report on Earth Week, as observed in Philadelphia      by<br />      THURSDAY'S DRUMMER, 4221 Germantown Avenue,<br />      Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19140/weekly paper/$7.00 a year    </p>    <p>      Philadelphia is a city of passive people waiting for a      leader. This week, the passive people are circulating a      rumor that Earth Week is coming up. No one knows where or      how, since Earth Week has virtually vanished from      Philadelphia. This happened after the tremendous success it      was last year. (Imagine what would have happened if it had      flopped.)    </p>    <p>      Anyway, can we take this opportunity to remind you that      people called conservationists existed in the world a long      time before a few groovy people decided to capitalize on      the idea? Support conservation any way you can-even      if it's only through donations-and make it a point to      take out some time next week to think about the ideals that      Earth Week stands for. Do it on your own because there will      be no leaders. +    </p>        <p>      Here is our yuk for the week.    </p>    <p>      The 50,000 people who attended this year's opening day of      Earth week left a mess of litter behind them-in      contempt of the principles for which they ostensibly were      gathered.    </p>    <p>      Don't laugh. If you were there, you will probably remember      some piece <em>of</em> junk that you tossed on the      grass-an innocent gum wrapper, perhaps. Your gum      wrapper was only part of the trash that needed to be picked      up by 34 park workers-representatives of the city,      ironically an institution usually attacked for apathy.      These 34 workers ended up filling more than six sanitation      department trucks with the junk left behind by all the      groovy people. Included among the detritus <em>of</em> the      Earth Day ideal were cardboard fried chicken containers      from Gino's, abandoned blankets, socks, shoes of all makes,      kites, frisbees, pieces of sandwiches, fruit peelings, Coke      bottles, newspapers, gum wrappers, and other      non-classifiable junk.    </p>    <p>      What should have happened that day-right there while      WIBG was parading its groovy rock bands around the      stage-is that Nixon should have ordered a gigantic      machine to swoop down from the sky and, in one moment of      pure ecological ecstasy, it should have recycled the entire      plateau and the phonies along with it. +    </p>
