            <hr />    <p>      Now's the time to give special attention to your      nutritional needs.    </p>    <hr />        <p>      While January and February's wind, rain, and snow can      curtail many of our activities ... germs and viruses go      right on about their business of making us sick regardless      of the weather! In fact, it sometimes seems as if the      invisible nuisances absolutely thrive during the wet,      chilly months . . . "brewing up" an endless assortment of      colds, coughs, sniffles, sore throats, and all of the other      related miseries that accompany such illnesses.</p><p> Consider,      though, that humankind's wintertime vulnerability to colds      and flu may not lie so much with these malevolent microbes      and virulent viruses (they're around much of the time      anyway) as it does in the change of lifestyle that winter      often brings.</p><p> We tend, for example, to spend more time      indoors (all too often in hot, stuffy rooms) during the      winter months, and-when we leave our closed-up and      heated homes for the frigid outdoors-we give our      systems a resounding shock. Then, once outside, we still      have to contend with unexpected, drastic changes in the      weather itself! Such winter stresses tend to use up the      body's supply of vitamin C at a rapid rate. Yet fresh      fruits and vegetables, our best source of C, are often so      expensive and in such short supply during the cold part of      the year that-more than likely-most folks      actually <em>reduce their</em> intake of such important      foods when they need them more than ever! </p><p>Winter's a time      to give special consideration to our intake of the oil      vitamins, A and D, too. Vitamin D (the "sunshine" vitamin)      is present in only limited quantities in most ordinary      foods ... with the exception of such "primary sources" as      egg yolks, fortified milk products, and unrefined oils. If      you spend considerable time indoors and avoid consuming      milk and eggs (items that are often kept out of people's      diets for any one of a number of reasons), your body may be      short on D. (And, as you probably know, a vitamin A      deficiency can lower your resistance to respiratory and      other infections.)    </p>    <h3>      THE SNACKIN' SEASON    </h3>    <p>      During the winter months many people also seem to turn to      sweeter and/or starchier diets. And-since more time      is devoted to games, reading, and other indoor leisure      pursuits during the cold part of the year-folks have      a tendency to snack more,</p><p> Such impromptu eating habits can      create, among other things, a deficiency in the minerals      needed for the essential action of certain enzymes that      break down and metabolize the nutritious foods we do eat.      Furthermore, the older men and women get, the more they may      have to rely on enzymes in their <em>diets ... rather</em>      than the supply their bodies produce. However, enzymes are      generally destroyed when they encounter any heat higher      than body temperature, so-since we eat more cooked      foods in winter-it's no wonder a "cold season" seems      to occur during the chilly months.</p><p> Fortunately, all such      essential nutrients -plus the equally vital protein,      iron, and B-complex vitamins-can be easily obtained      in a carefully planned winter diet ... or through the use      of well-balanced vitamin and mineral supplements, which (if      taken on a regular basis) can do a great deal to stave off      or at least minimize the miseries that winter or a change      in seasons often brings.    </p>
