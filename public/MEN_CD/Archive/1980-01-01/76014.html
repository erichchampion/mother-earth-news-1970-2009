            			<hr />         <p>      <em>In 1976, Tom Ferguson-then a fourth-year medical      student at Yale-launched a magazine called</em> <em>Medical      Self-Care... which-he hoped-would serve as "a Whole Earth      Catalog of the best medical books, tools, and      resources".</em></p><p> <em>Tom spoke of his plans for the      publication and of his conviction that self-care could      raise the general level of health in this country and</em>      <em>lower our inflated, levels of medical spending-in the      Plowboy Interview in MOTHER NO. 51 . . . and left no doubt      that he would work toward making those "dreams"come      true.</em></p><p> <em><em>Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson      now, and the medical self-care "movement"-as well as Tom's      magazine-has flourished. People are beginning to assume      more responsibility for their own well-being and are eager      for information that will help them take better care of      their bodies.</em></em></p><p> <em>So-in an effort to provide just      such very necessary data-THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> &reg      offers as a regular feature a piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D.,      entitled (what else?) "Medical Self-Care".</em></p><hr />      <h3>Hold a Community Health Fair</h3>			<p>A local health fair (which blends the spirit of an open classroom,      an old-fashioned barn raising, and a science exhibit) can      provide your neighborhood or town with information on a      mixture of traditional and alternative healing      philosophies. In fact, one of the main reasons for holding      such an event is to create a local network of individuals      interested in health and self-care . . . and to offer those      folks the opportunity to get to know one another-personally      and professionally-by working together while serving the      community.</p><p> In addition, such neighborhood gatherings      dramatically reflect the medical consumer's new interest      in-and attitude toward-health and self-care. (Besides,      they're a lot of fun! )</p>			<h3>GET ORGANIZED</h3>			<p>Most of the experienced "experts" who we've talked to recommend      that prospective organizers put in from two to ten months'      advanced planning before an actual fair is held. (Just      remember that every facet of the event's coordination will      take much longer than you'd think possible.)</p><p> First, take      stock of your immediate community resources: nurses,      physicians, health educators, pharmacists, counselors,      dentists, public health experts, paramedics, midwives,      masseurs and masseuses, meditation instructors, yoga      practitioners, and such organized groups as the American      Red Cross . . . the American Cancer Society . . . the      heart, lung, and diabetes associations . . . your local      mental health center . . . Alcoholics Anonymous . . . your      neighborhood library ... and-definitely-your local fire      department (its members are trained to explain emergency      medical procedures). </p><p>Also, consider asking other community      groups to cosponsor the fair. The PTA, local schools,      wholistic health centers, churches, and service      organizations (such as the Lions, Rotary, or Kiwanis clubs)      are all good bets. (Be sure to utilize every group that      even <em>hints</em> at wanting to contribute . . . in order      to make the event a true community endeavor.)</p>			<h3>MAKE CONTACTS</h3>			<p>It would be a good idea to get in      touch-as far in advance of the fair's starting date as      possible-with the National Health Screening Council (4905      Del Ray Avenue, Suite 307, Bethesda, Maryland 20014 ...      telephone 301/ 657-8480). The organization has provided      materials, phone consulting, screening protocols,      equipment, and laboratory support facilities for over 800      community health fairs in the past year alone.</p><p> You should      also contact the National Self-Help Clearinghouse (33 West      42nd Street, Room 1227, New York, New York 10036) for      information on any self-help groups that might be willing      to tie in with your fair. The Health Systems Agency is yet      another valuable source of information. If you can't locate      this group, write Aetna Life and Casualty (151 Farming ton      Road, Hartford, Connecticut 06156) for the address of the      office nearest you. Blue Cross and Blue Shield (840 North      Lakeshore Drive, Chicago, Illinois 60611) can also aid you      . . . by referring you to a local Blue Cross or Blue Shield      Plan that can supply a <em>quantity</em> of self-care      booklets (for free or at a nominal charge, depending on the      number of pamphlets required).</p>			<h3>WHEN AND WHERE</h3>			<p> Spring seems to be the best season for a      health fair. The promise of warm weather usually brings      everyone's energy level up, and there's a feeling of      wanting to participate . . . of wanting to learn and teach.      If held in the fall, your event would likely have to      compete with many other kinds of happenings (and, at that      time of year, Christmas always seems to be just around the      corner). Then, in summer, many potential fairgoers will be      vacationing. You can't have a fair without people, of      course, so it's usually best to plan a spring event.</p><p> A      weekend is the obvious "right" time for a fair, and      Saturday is the best day by far. Remember that you'll need      a number of hours to set up the exhibits and an equal      amount of time to disassemble them, so try to limit your      actual fair hours . . . from 10:00 a.m. to 4:00 p.m. is      about right. And be sure to allot specific shifts      (generally two or three hours) to the people who do the      exhibits, screening, or whatever . . . so nobody gets      overworked. Also, if you've announced beforehand that folks      should fast before undergoing specific screening exams, you      should certainly plan on a big crowd for such "tests" the      first thing in the morning! </p><p>You'll require an exhibit hall      large enough for people to wander around in, as well as      smaller designated areas or rooms in which to hold      individual workshops. Outdoor fairs are nice, but the      weather does have a way of changing when you least expect      it to. A gym is an ideal location . . . or a large church      basement or a shopping center's mall would also do fine.      Just be sure to hold your event in a place that everyone      can easily <em>find</em>.</p>			<h3>PUBLICIZE IT</h3>			 <p>A fair won't be much of a success if you don't get the word      out, so try to include an experienced publicity person on      your initial planning committee.</p><p> First, make a list of all      the media in your community: radio and television stations,      newspapers, magazines, newsletters, etc. Then compile a      roster of the central communication networks (such as      churches, schools, unions, businesses, community      organizations) where you can place posters promoting the      event. Finally-if you plan to mail flyers announcing your      fair-get hold of all the mailing lists you can use: church      memberships, garden clubs, seniors' organizations, service      clubs, and so on.</p><p> Put as much attention as possible into      posters and fliers. (Your local printer might be willing to      contribute this material if he can put "donated by . . ."      at the bottom of each sheet.) Also, be sure to ask the      local schools to send notices home with their students.</p><p>      Then, a couple of days before the fair, prepare an advance      mock-up of one or more of the proposed activities . . . and      invite the local crews from your TV stations and newspapers      to come and film and take pictures. Remember, these media      will need advance visual material if their coverage is      going to increase the number of people attending the fair.</p>      <h3>ADDITIONAL IDEAS</h3>			<p>Other than workshops by individuals and exhibits by the various groups, you might      try to set up actual screening stations that offer, for      example, the following: A self-administered health history,      a height/weight, blood pressure check, anemia check      (hematocrit), blood tests (probably involving a $6.00 to      $7.00 fee), oral screening by a dentist, hearing/ vision      check, or foot exams by a podiatrist (probably in      conjunction with a foot massage). </p><p>The list of "attractions"      your fair can offer will depend, of course, upon resources      in your community. However, whether the event is small or      large, everyone who attends should have a good time and      learn something . . . not only about his or her health, but      about the health resources of the town as well!    </p>
