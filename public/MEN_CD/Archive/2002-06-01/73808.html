                <p>      <strong>Make Your Own</strong>    </p>        <h5>      Story, photos and illustrations by<br />      Janet and Mark Knickerbocker    </h5>    <p>      <strong>If you get dairy goats, you'll probably want to      build this nifty stanchion to make milking easy for both      the milker and the milkee. The stanchion features an      adjustable seat for the milker, a platform to raise the      goat to a comfortable height and a feed box to keep her      content while you milk.</strong><br />    </p>    			    <p>      To make the stanchion, you'll need a skill saw, jigsaw,      electric drill, Phillips screwdriver for the drill, a 1/16"      drill bit to bore pilot holes for screws and 1 1/2" wood      screws.    </p>    <p>      If you want, you can add a chain neck restraint, which will      come in handy when introducing a new goat to milking.    </p>    <h3>      The Stanchion    </h3>    <p>      <strong>MATERIALS</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>A. Two 44" 1x12s for front<br /></em> <em>B. Two 48"      1x12s for bottom<br />      C. Two 23" 1x6s for leg supports<br />      D. One 36" 1x8 for seat slide<br />      E. Four 10 1/2" 2x4s for legs<br /></em> <em>F. Two 23"      2x4s for slide support<br />      G. One 36" 2x4 cut 45 degrees on each end (for brace)<br />      H. One 23" 1x4 (top connector)<br />      I. Two 8" L-brackets<br />      J. One 6"piece of light chain<br />      K One screw eye, one screw book<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>FRONT:</strong> Begin with the two 44" 1x12s (A).      Lay one on top of the other. Using a jigsaw cut out one      half of the keyhole. Start the bottom of the keyhole at 19"      with the top ending at 39". (See illustration for the      shape, which may need to be enlarged to accommodate a goat      with horns.) Lay the two boards (A) side by side and screw      the top connector (H) flush with the top. Use four 1/2"      screws. Mount the L-brackets (I) flush with the bottom of      front (A) on each outside edge, again using the 1 1/2"      screws.    </p>    			    <p>      <strong>FLOOR:</strong> Position the two bottom boards (B)      side by side. As pictured, position the slide supports (F)      under the bottom boards (B) and screw down from the top      using 12 1 1/2" screws, six per support. Attach the seat      slide (D) across the bottom and flush with the outside edge      of the slide support (F).    </p>    <p>      <strong>BRACING:</strong> Screw the leg supports (C) to the      slide supports (F) using six 1!" screws in each. Attach the      legs (E) to the leg supports (C) and to the bottom (B) on      all four corners. Attach each leg using four 1 1/2" screws,      two in the top and two in the side.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO ATTACH FRONT TO FLOOR:</strong> Attach the front      (A) to the bottom (B) using the L-brackets previously      installed on the front (A). Position brace (G) as shown in      the diagram and screw to the front (A) and the bottom (B)      flush with the far side of the stanchion.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like a restraint to confine your goat loosely to      the stanchion, attach screw eye (K) to the right side near      the bottom of the keyhole. Attach chain (J) to the screw      eye (K). Attach the screw hook on the left side of the      keyhole so you can fasten the chain loosely.    </p>    <h3>      The Seat    </h3>    <p>      <strong>MATERIALS</strong>    </p>        <p>      A. One 36" 1x12 (adjustable slide)<br />      B. Two 16" 1x12s (sides)<br />      C. One 16" 1x12 (top)<br />    </p>    <p>      Mark and cut the two sides (B) as indicated on the diagram.      Attach adjustable slide (A) onto sides (B) 8 1/2" from the      bottom. Use three W screws on each side. Attach the top (C)      across the top of the sidepieces allowing 2" of overhang on      each. Attach with six 1 1/2" screws, three on each      side.<br />    </p>    <h3>      The Feed Box    </h3>    <p>      <strong>MATERIALS</strong>    </p>        <p>      A. Two 13 1/2" 1x4s (front and back)<br />      B. Two 12" 1x4s (sides)<br />      C. One 15" 1x12 (bottom)<br />      Two 4" L-brackets<br />    </p>    <p>      Screw together the front and back (A) to the sides (B). Use      two 1 1/2" screws in each corner. Attach bottom (C) using      three 1 1/2 " screws per side. Attach L-brackets to the      bottom of the box, flush with outside edge. These will      later attach the feed box to the stanchion.    </p>    <p>      Mark and Janet homestead in northeastern Missouri where      Janet is a freelance writer and Mark works for the Missouri      Department of Transportation.    </p>
