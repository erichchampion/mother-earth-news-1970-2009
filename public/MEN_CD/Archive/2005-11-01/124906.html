        Moles like to feed on the grubs, earthworms and other soil crittersthat they may find in your garden, and in the process they cansometimes damage your plants. A repellent mixture of castor oil andsoap usually causes moles to leave an area. Put one-half cup eachof castor oil and dishwashing liquid in a jar, and shake well. Usethis as a concentrate and mix 2 to 3 tablespoons in a gallon ofwarm water. Use a watering can to dribble it over the area you wantto protect. A castor oil-based commercial product called Mole-Medhas the same effect. Until you get the animals to feed somewhereelse, make time to visit your garden each morning and step on allthe tunnels around your plants.
