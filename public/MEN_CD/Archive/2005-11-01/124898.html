        Next time a bad weather day has you and the children stuck inside,make up a batch of play dough and turn the little ones loose forsome creative squishing and molding. Scavenge through the kitchenfor odds and ends to make imprints in the dough. A rolling pincomes in handy as well.<br /><br />There are many recipes for this activity. Here's my favorite, usedfor both my children and my grandchildren.<br /><br /><i>2 cups flour</i><br /><i>1 cup salt</i><br /><i>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</i><br /><i>2 cups water with several drops of food coloring added</i><br /><i>4 teaspoons cream of tartar</i><br /><br />Mix ingredients together in a saucepan over medium heat. Stirconstantly until mixture thickens. Remove from heat and turn doughonto a plate to cool. Store in a covered container or plastic bag.Finished creations can be baked slowly in the oven until hardened,then painted.
