        <p>In MOTHER NO. 70-on page 28-we ran an article that revealed some of the trade secrets used by our research crew to keep their inventory of bladed tools razor sharp. And-although the article itself was quite thorough-several of our readers have requested that we provide more details about the belt sander/sharpener described in that piece. So, in answer to these inquiries, here's an illustration that should help to clear up any questions regarding its assembly.</p>
