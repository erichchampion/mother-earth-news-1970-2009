                    <p>      <em>For this issue, Dr. Torn Ferguson's column was written      by the Women's Health Editor of</em> Medical Self-Care.    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     <strong> by By Sandra Ritz</strong>    </h5>    <p>      Menstrual pain and discomfort-or      <em>dysmenorrhea-is</em> America's (and likely the      <em>world's)</em> number one gynecological problem. More      than half of all women who have periods also experience      monthly cramps. And, of those, approximately 10% suffer      pain severe enough to send them to bed for a day or more      each month. In fact, a 1978 study published in the      <em>American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology</em>      named dysmenorrhea as the greatest single cause of school      and work absences among American women (it accounts for the      loss of an estimated 140 million productive hours      annually).    </p>    <p>      The pain of menstrual cramps is all too real, but      traditionally physicians label the symptoms "psychogenic"      (originating in the mind) and prescribe either narcotics or      tranquilizers. And why do health care professionals tend to      take the condition lightly? Well, their seeming lack of      concern is likely due to the fact that dysmenorrhea hasn't      fit into the medical profession's accepted definition of      disease . . . that is, it couldn't (until recently) be      traced to an identifiable cause (such as a microorganism or      a toxin), and it doesn't result in any significant visible      injury (except the pain, which varies widely from woman to      woman). Now that attitude may be <em>insensitive,</em> but      it's not too surprising that women with a problem which      defies the very standards doctors are trained to view as      near sacred are often dismissed as "neurotic"!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE CULPRIT: PROSTAGLANDINS</strong>    </p>    <p>      However, there's no longer any reason to consider monthly      cramps as psychosomatic, because their cause-at      least- <em>has</em> finally been identified. The      culprits, prostaglandins, are chemicals-produced by      tissues in the bodies of both males and females-which      stimulate the contractions in smooth muscles (one of which      is the uterus). The first link between prostaglandins and      dysmenorrhea was uncovered in 1957, when a British doctor      isolated some fatlike substances in menstrual blood that      appeared to stimulate uterine contractions . . . and the      same chemicals were later identified as two types of      prostaglandins. Subsequent research showed that women who      suffer from severe dysmenorrhea have considerably higher      amounts of prostaglandins in their menstrual discharge than      do women who don't have painful cramps. It has also been      proved that birth control pills <em>relieve</em> cramps by      preventing ovulation and thus limiting the buildup of      prostaglandins that normally occurs during that part of the      menstrual cycle. Finally, it was found that chemical      prostaglandin inhibitors, such as aspirin, can help ease      the discomfort of dysmenorrhea. (In fact, Midol-a      popular over the-counter cramp remedy-is mostly      aspirin.)    </p>    <p>      In addition to prostaglandins, there are several other      factors that-it's speculated-contribute to      dysmenorrhea.    </p>    <p>      <em>Family history.</em> It hasn't yet been established      whether prostaglandin overproduction is hereditary, but      studies do show that daughters of women with severe      dysmenorrhea are likely to experience such cramps      themselves.    </p>    <p>      <em>IUD's.</em> Painful cramping is a common effect of IUD      usage . . . and it now appears that intrauterine devices      actual <em>ly stimulate</em> prostaglandin production. Many      women have had them removed for that reason.    </p>    <p>      Other common troublemakers include bladder infections,      bowel problems, and yeast infections. It's also long been      noted that women who suffer acute dysmenorrhea often become      depressed and irritable as their periods approach (who      <em>wouldn't,</em> when anticipating several days of severe      pain?), and there was a time when doctors believed that      depression in women <em>caused</em> menstrual discomfort .      . . but I'd say it's more likely the other way around!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE VARIETIES</strong> <strong>OF      DYSMENORRHEA</strong>    </p>    <p>      Whatever their origins, there are three separate kinds of      severe monthly cramping. <em>Primary spasmodic</em>      dysmenorrhea is characterized by sharp, wavelike      cramps-in the lower abdomen and inner      thighs-which last for a day or two after the onset of      menstruation. The condition usually subsides when a woman      reaches her late twenties. <em>Primary congestive</em>      dysmenorrhea, on the other hand, involves a dull, aching      pain and the uncomfortable, bloated feeling of edema. This      type of menstrual distress often persists until menopause,      getting worse with age.    </p>    <p>      <em>Secondary</em> dysmenorrhea tends to occur suddenly,      often after years of less painful periods . . . and it may      be associated with one of several health problems, some of      them as serious as pelvic inflammatory disease or      reproductive cancers. This ailment, therefore, should be      treated by a physician. The more common primary forms of      menstrual discomfort, though, can usually be alleviatedor      even eliminated-by following a carefully chosen      program of self-care.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RELIEF IS UP TO YOU</strong>    </p>    <p>      The following list begins with "nonaggressive" approaches      to dealing with menstrual pain, then moves on to more      drastic measures. You should feel free to use whatever      techniques suit your needs.    </p>    <p>      <em>Exercise</em> Medical studies agree that as a woman's      physical condition improves, her cramps tend to lessen in      severil so going to bed when discomfort hits is actually      one of the <em>worst</em> things you can do! Any form of      mild exercise will help: Take a walk, ride your bike, or      try a few minutes of yoga. Certain posturessuch as kneeling      on all fours with your head down and your hips      elevated-will sometimes help relieve cramping, too.    </p>    <p>      <em>Diet.</em> Individual women's reactions to foods vary      tremendously, but it's often said that dairy foods      aggravate menstrual-related bowel problems. Of course, if      you become constipated, you can alleviate the problem by      drinking more fluids (probably not milk) and increasing      your fiber intake. Word-of-mouth endorsement also speaks      well of dolomite (or any mixture of calcium and magnesium      in a 2:1 ratio). Begin taking the mineral supplements one      week before your period is due. (Eating more leafy      vegetables will also provide a calcium boost.)    </p>    <p>      Other women say that B vitamins-especially      Ba-act as diuretics and help alleviate edema. And if      yeast infections are a problem, reduce your consumption of      sugar and take more buttermilk and yogurt for their      beneficial lactobacillus bacteria.    </p>    <p>      <em>Contraception.</em> It's widely agreed that      dysmenorrhea is-to a certain extentstressrelated, and      the fear of an unwanted pregnancy can cause enormous      anxiety to accompany the onset of a woman's period (or the      <em>lack</em> of it). If you don't want to conceive, avoid      the worry by using contraception consistently.    </p>    <p>      <em>Herb teas.</em> Traditional remedies for cramps include      catnip, saffron, chamomile, mint, raspberry, and blackberry      leaf infusions. Dandelion and sassafras are mild diuretics,      so teas brewed from such herbs may help relieve a bloated      feeling.    </p>    <p>      <em>Heat.</em> Grandmother was right! Warm baths or a hot      water bottle held on the lower back or the abdomen will      work wonders.    </p>    <p>      <em>Massage.</em> Menstrual pain is often transferred to      the lower spinal area, so a soothing back massage-with warm      coconut oil or another lubricant-can really help. Some      women obtain relief from abdominal massage, as well.    </p>    <p>      <em>Acupressure.</em> This form of natural healing is      simply acupuncture without the needles: To use it, you      press a fingertip firmly on the appropriate points to      release blocked currents of energy. There are several      acupressure points that help relax the uterus. First,      stimulate the small hollow of bone that's one hand's width      above the ankle on the inside of the leg. Also try the      point two thumb widths up the inner arm, above the junction      of the wrist and arm and in line with the middle finger . .      . or the one between the nail and first joint of the middle      finger on the side toward the thumb.    </p>    <p>      <em>Aspirin.</em> This old standby is a mild prostaglandin      inhibitor, but it's only 1/30 as potent as the powerful      drugs listed below. Both plain <em>and</em> buffered      aspirin can cause stomach upset or gastrointestinal      bleeding, though, so be sure to take either of those      medications on a full stomach or with milk.    </p>    <p>      If the nonaggressive approaches listed above don't provide      enough relief, you probably ought to have a physical      (including a pelvic exam) to rule out any organic problems      . . . particularly gonorrhea. At any rate, you will need to      see a doctor to obtain a prescription for any of the      following medications.    </p>    <p>      <em>Prostaglandin inhibitors.</em> These are the "latest      thing", which means they have both advantages and      disadvantages. They do work very well to reduce cramping,      but have also been known to cause such side effects as      rashes, headaches, gastrointestinal upset, and/or severe      bleeding. (Because the drugs are so new, other long-term      effects have not yet been determined.) If you're not using      any form of contraception in conjunction with the      prostaglandin inhibitors, <em>don't take then until your      period actually starts.</em> If you ingest the drug for a      few days <em>before you</em> expect your menstrual flow,      and it turns out that you've actually been pregnant for a      month, you'll have bathed the first-trimester fetus in a      possibly dangerous chemical.    </p>    <p>      <em>Narcotics.</em> Narcotics-especially      codeine-have long been administered to women      suffering severe cramps . . . and, although they're      undoubtedly effective, the drugs can cause unpleasant side      effects (such as drowsiness, nausea, and constipation).      Personally, I'd suggest that you try to get by without      narcotics and instead use some form of stress reduction.      However, anyone with really debilitating pain      <em>needs</em> the strength of narcotics . . . and, for      such cases, I'm glad they're available. Addiction, by the      way, won't be a problem for anyone who takes narcotics for      only one or two days each month. It would require one or      two weeks of steady high doses to create a physical      dependence.    </p>    <p>      <em>Birth control pills.</em> As I mentioned earlier, the      Pill prevents ovulation, which is the signal for a buildup      of cramp-producing prostaglandin . . . so oral      contraceptives can be quite effective in relieving      menstrual pain. Each woman, I think, should weigh for      herself the costs and benefits of the Pill. There      <em>are</em> well-known health risks involved . . . but in      some cases the disadvantages may be preferable to severe      monthly pain.    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Tom Ferguson's quarterly journal,</em>      Medical Self-Care, is <em>available for $15 per year from      Medical Self-Care, Dept.
