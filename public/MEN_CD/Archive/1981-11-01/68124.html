                    <p>      <strong>VIEW FROM THE EXECUTIVE SUITE:</strong> A recent      study has shown that while 53% of the general public prefer      solar power to that generated by coal or nuclear      facilities, only 9% of the corporate executives surveyed      view sun power as a desirable energy alternative.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WIND 'ER UP</strong> <strong>:</strong> UCLA      engineers believe that the car of the future may be      equipped with devices fitted with giant elastic bands      that-in effect-recycle braking energy for use      in acceleration. The project's directors point out that as      much as 30% of the fuel burned in urban driving is wasted      in braking. However, the researchers admit they've been      unable to whip one problem encountered in their testing:      The rubber bands keep breaking.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOO COSTLY AND TOO UNCERTAIN</strong> were the      words used by the National Academy of Sciences in      evaluating the solar power satellite (SPS) concept. The      Department of Energy had proposed an SPS system comprising      60 photovoltaic-cell-equipped satellites-each      the size of Manhattan Island-which would supply      electricity to earth. The project's cost was estimated at      more than $3 trillion. (See page 125 for more details on      the SPS issue.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>COCONUT WATTS:</strong> Natives on the South Seas      island of Bora Bora have returned to the power source they      used prior to World War II: a generating plant fueled by      coconut husks. It's estimated that each Bora Bora household      requires the equivalent of six coconut husks an hour to      produce its electricity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AN AC BREAKTHROUGH?</strong> About the same time      Exxon's Reliance Electric Company announced that it was      abandoning its research on alternating current synthesis      technology (a technique that was aimed at increasing the      efficiency of electric motors), NASA revealed that it has      developed a device to reduce the energy consumption of such      powerplants by half.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SOLAR/LIQUID METAL SYSTEM</strong> , developed by      an Israeli scientist, employs a collector containing a      metal alloy . . . which, when heated and mixed with a      volatile liquid, causes the latter substance to vaporize.      The vapor then drives the metal, at high speed, through      piping in a high-intensity magnetic field. Electrodes tap      the electricity that's produced, and the metal and liquid      are then separated and recycled. The system has no moving      parts, will cost about $70,000 for a 100-kilowatt unit, and      should last 30 years without repairs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ICE CONDITIONING:</strong> Issue 68's Energy      Flashes mentioned the ice-filled basement as a possible      replacement for conventional air conditioning. As it turns      out, the concept will soon be a reality: Engineers are      beginning work on an ice pond that'll be incorporated into      the cooling system of a 130,000-square-foot      Prudential Insurance Company building now under      construction.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NUCLEAR EVACUATION:</strong> After evaluating      estimates of the time necessary-in an      emergency-to evacuate persons living within a      ten-mile radius of atomic power plants, the Nuclear      Regulatory Commission has classified 17 of the estimates as      "poor". The NRC rated 27 plants' reports as "adequate", and      five were termed "excellent". (Two of the facilities didn't      even bother to respond.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>RENEWABLES NEWS:</strong> The National Solar      Heating and Cooling Information Center has now become the      Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and Referral      Service (CAREIRS) and is offering information about energy      conservation and such technologies as wind, biomass,      photovoltaics, ocean and solar thermal, and more. The      service operates from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. eastern time, and      the toll-free numbers are 800 / 523-2929 for the      continental U.S., the Virgin Islands, and Puerto Rico . . .      800/462-4983 for Pennsylvania residents . . . and 800/      537-4700 for Alaska and Hawaii.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CATTAIL FUEL:</strong> Cattails can yield up to      1,000 gallons of ethanol per acre, as opposed to the 200      gallons possible from corn or 640 gallons from sugar cane,      according to an experimental study called the Aquahol      Project. Furthermore, the plants can be grown in swamps and      thus do not compete for agricultural cropland.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOP SEED:</strong> After successful tests using      peanut oil to fuel diesel engines, Gold Kist (a large      agricultural concern) is forging ahead with research on      other vegetable oils-such as cottonseed, sunflower,      linseed, and coconut-as replacements for      petroleum-derived fuels. Gold Kist says the results      are promising because the plant's protein meal can be used      as food after the oil has been extracted.    </p>    <p>      Researchers at Israel's Ben-Gurion University have      developed a <strong>SOLAR GREENHOUSE COVERING,</strong>      filled with a pale gray dye, that can collect the sun's      rays for heating while still allowing the light necessary      for photosynthesis to filter into the structure ....      Georgia Tech is converting a <strong>FAMILY-OWNED DAIRY      FARM INTO AN ENERGY-INDEPENDENT MODEL:</strong> It'll      feature a methane-fueled generator, a hydroelectric plant,      wood-fired boilers and furnaces, solar water heaters, and      an alcohol fuel distillery .... After an absence of ten      years, the <strong>EFM COAL-FIRED, WARM-AIR STOKER      FURNACE</strong> is back on the market. General Machine      Corporation (Dept. TMEN, Fourth and Furnace Streets,      Emmaus, Pennsylvania 18049) is producing the coal-burner in      response to consumer demand for a less costly-to-operate      home heating system .... <strong>GLASS-REINFORCED      CONCRETE</strong> may provide a lightweight, strong, and      low-cost material for solarand wind-energy applications.      Researchers say the substance can be readily formed into      curved or angled shapes .... <strong>THE WOODSTOVE TAX      CREDIT</strong> that was originally part of the Reagan      administration's proposed tax cut legislation has been      eliminated from the final bill.    </p>
