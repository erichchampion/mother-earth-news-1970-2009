                <p>      <strong>Though there's a long way to go in categorizing and      measuring all the effluents involved, research done in the      past year has produced a wealth of new information      about</strong> ...    </p>        <p>      Ever since the first alarms about woodstove emissions were      sounded, almost two years ago, there's been a flurry of      research done on the subject. Many of the findings of the      spring-of-1980 Monsanto study that formed the groundwork      for concern (MOTHER reported on the situation in issue 67)      have been supported. But some of the new data have led to      questions about the <em>relevance</em> of the testing      methods that the Monsanto/Auburn University researchers      used to reach their startling conclusions.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POLLUTION TODAY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Work done by more than a dozen different laboratories has      confirmed that "airtight" woodstoves <em>do</em> emit large      amounts of carbon monoxide, particulates, and unburned      hydrocarbons. But the importance of the Monsanto team's      discovery of significant amounts of "polycyclic organic      matter", or POM (sometimes called "polycyclic aromatic      hydrocarbons", or PAH . . . many of which are known      carcinogens), in smoke is now in doubt.    </p>    <p>      Throughout the course of its research, the Monsanto/Auburn      group maintained burn rates of 15 (or more) pounds of wood      per hour . . . while most <em>homeourners</em> fire between      two and six pounds of wood per hour. It was assumed at the      time that the lower, more common burn rates would yield      even greater quantities of POM than those noted in the      tests . . . since hydrocarbon emissions-in      general-increase as wood consumption drops. But work done      in the last year has failed to confirm that theory. Though      scientists emphasize that the new data are far from      complete or conclusive, the emissions of some POM compounds      seem to <em>drop</em> at the lower burn rates typical of      home woodstoves. Argonne National Laboratories tests, for      example, have found little evidence of benzo (a) pyrene (a      particularly toxic PAH) at typical household firing levels.    </p>    <p>      However, before we breathe a possibly premature sigh of      relief (and, perhaps, inhale something that we might later      regret), we must accept the fact that there's a great deal      left to be learned about woodstove smoke. For example, a      recently released report of the prelimi nary findings in a      Dow Chemical study suggests that dioxins (see the Plowboy      Interview with Bonnie Hill-page 16-for more information on      these extremely hazardous compounds) may be produced in      woodburning appliances. (The cynical among us might      question Dow's motives in conducting this bit of research,      how ever, since the report concluded that the offending      toxins did <em>not</em> come from her bicide-contaminated      wood.).    </p>    <p>      Perhaps the newest and least understood of the      woodburning-related pollution problems came to light with      the discovery (by a Geomet Technologies team) that many      woodstoveequipped homes have <em>indoor</em> levels of      carbon monoxide, breathable particulates, and even members      of the POM family that are more than ten times greater than      <em>outdoor</em> measurements taken at the same time.      Unfortunately, it'll be a while before we learn just how      such a predicament occurs, since the financially gutted      Environmental Protection Agency has no funding to build on      the work done by Geomet.    </p>    <p>      In fact, our understanding of the elements and compounds      that occur in woodstove smoke is <em>far</em> from      complete. Scientists have been studying automobile and      coal-fired powerplant emissions for decades, but we're just      <em>beginning</em> to get an idea of the possible      environmental impact of woodburning heaters.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE SILVER (OR AT</strong> <strong>LEAST SHINY)      LINING</strong>    </p>    <p>      There is also a <em>positive</em> side to our recent      woodstove emissions research. We've learned <em>more</em>      about the physics of combustion in the last couple of years      than in all the years since humankind discovered fire. In      turn, new stove designs and aftermarket products are      rapidly being developed to deal with already recognized      pollution problems. In addition, a wealth of information      concerning how a woodstove owner can op <em>erate</em> his      or her stove in a cleaner fashion has recently become      available.    </p>    <p>      And there are fringe benefits to the pollution studies, as      well. Creosote-that scourge of every      woodburner-is produced under the same conditions as      are pollutants. The gooey substance that clings to      stovepipes is created by unburned material expelled from      the fire below. Though the actual ratio of creosote deposit      to emissions varies (depending on factors such as flue gas      velocity, stack temperature, etc.), more pollution is      almost always accompanied by heavier creosote formation.      (According to Dr. Stockton Barnett of the State University      of New York, an average stove installation leaves about 10%      of its particulate and hydrocarbon emissions in its flue,      in the form of creosote. )    </p>    <p>      What's more, the majority of the schemes devised to reduce      emissions and/or creosote buildup also tend to improve the      overall <em>efficiency</em> of woodstoves. Since most of      the materials that make up smoke happen to be combustible,      a popular approach to preventing the offenders from      reaching the atmosphere is to burn <em>them,</em> either in      or above the fire. And, of course, doing so also increases      the amount of heat that can be gotten from a given amount      of wood!    </p>    <p>      <strong>OPERATOR TECHNIQUES</strong> <strong>FOR CUTTING      EMISSIONS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Despite the fact that the study of woodstove emissions and      efficiency is in its infancy (and, therefore, different      groups still use divergent test methods and arrive at      sometimes conflicting conclusions), researchers are      unanimous about one facet of the pollution/ creosote      production process: Every study has found that operator      methods can play a larger role in reducing creosote and      emissions than can any other factor that's yet been      examined! As a result, a clear-cut set of cleanburn      instructions has been developed over the past year.    </p>    <p>      The five rules which we're about to offer are mostly      matters of common sense. But in order to understand      <em>why</em> they make sense, you'll need to know a little      about <em>how</em> wood burns. The combustion process has      been theoretically divided into three phases: evaporation,      where the moisture in the wood is removed . . . pyrolysis,      the release of volatile gases trapped in the fuel's      structure . . . and charring, during which the material's      carbon (in the form of charcoal) is burned. However, as      systematic and neat as this outline sounds, it is      complicated somewhat by the fact that the different stages      almost always overlap. Only at the very beginning and end      of a burning cycle (early evaporation and final charring,      respectively) are the distinctions clear.    </p>    <p>      The emission of particulates, hydrocarbons, and carbon      monoxide is primarily the result of two different      situations that can arise during the phases of burning. In      the pyrolysis stage, either a lack of oxygen or inadequate      temperature (it must be 1100Â°F or more) above the fire      will allow the volatile gases to escape without burning.      Any of several factors could lead to either of the      conditions. For example, if the stove's draft is too far      closed, there may not be enough air to burn the pyrolytic      products.    </p>    <p>      Emissions can also result from incomplete combustion in the      charring stage. And, again, the culprits here are too      little air and/or heat. Oxygen starvation might result from      a closeddown draft . . . or even inadequate      <em>.separation</em> of the individual pieces of fuel,      which can prevent air from reaching the burn area. Heat can      also be lost in other ways, one of which is the addition of      new wood to a bed of coals. The evaporation of the moisture      in the new fuel can draw large amounts of heat from an      already established burn.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the list of factors that could trigger either of      the two major pollution producing combustion situations      goes on and on, but the rules of thumb that follow have      proved-by actual experimentation-to deal with      many of them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FIVE WAYS TO CLEAR THE AIR</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rule 1: Use the largest-diameter logs that will burn      effectively. Big pieces of wood have less surface area per      unit of volume . . . which prevents them from releasing      volatiles too rapidly. This has been recognized as the      single most effective technique for reducing emissions!    </p>    <p>      Rule 2: Build as small a fire as is practical. A stuffed      firebox often leads to areas of pyrolysis and/or charring      that can't be reached by an adequate air it supply.      Therefore, use as few of the large pieces of wood as you      can while producing ingadequate heat.    </p>    <p>      Rule, :3: Keep the fire hot. Position the logs in your      stove so that air can move through the fire zone, and be      sure there's sufficient draft opening. Sin ce you're      already trying to make the fire as small as possible, you      can maintain high temperatures inside the stove without      overheating your home.    </p>    <p>      Rule 4: Don't increase or decrease the draft setting      drastically. Pyrolysis continues for some time after the      air supply has been cut back . . . so slamming the damper      shut can send much of your hard-won fuel up the chimney. On      the other hand, rapid opening of the damper can carry the      pyrolytic products away from the fire too quickly . . .      especially if there's a significant wind-induced      draft.    </p>    <p>      Rule 5: Avoid excessively wet, or dry, wood. Logs that are      too dry pyrolyze very quickly, overloading the combustion      zone with volatile gases . . . while very moist timbers can      inhibit effective combustion by absorbing heat for      evaporation. Standard air-dried soft or hard firewood (with      about 20 to 25% moisture content) seems to be the      cleanest-burning fuel.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, in order to observe these five rules, some stove      owners will have to change their habits slightly. Heaters      will require loading more frequently than was the case      during the era of the all-night burn. But, on the positive      side, many of us won't have to split logs as thoroughly as      we have done. And we must emphasize that following the      procedures listed above will not only cut down the      pollutants coming from your woodstove . . . it'll also help      to keep your stovepipe cleaner <em>and allow</em> you to      obtain more heat from a given amount of wood.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IS THERE A CLEANER STOVE?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Of course, it would be nice if we could just go out and buy      clean-burning stoves and reap the added benefits of clean      flues and greater efficiency. Unfortunately, among the      standard airtight heaters-whether they be updraft,      downdraft, sidedraft, baffled, cast iron, ceramic, or      whatnot-only the thin-walled steel stoves seem to      show any repeatable difference in performance: Such devices      consistently produce slightly more pollutant material and      are slightly less efficient than most conventional stoves.    </p>    <p>      However, we're about to describe a number of unconventional      designs that do achieve a significantly cleaner burn than      others.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BURNED AGAIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      One widely explored technique for cutting emissions and      increasing efficiency involves encouraging secondary      combustion. With this approach, specific provisions are      made to encourage the burning of pyrolytic products away      from the fire. Many modern stoves have secondary draft      controls that are designed to introduce combustion air to      the secondary zone. If such combustion actually took place      with any frequency, these appliances would burn      considerably cleaner than they actually do. Unfortunately,      most researchers have noted that it's extremely difficult      to establish and maintain a secondary burn with anything      less than "wide open" fires. In fact, among the      conventional heaters equipped with secondary air inlets, it      is fair to say that such "afterburning" rarely occurs.    </p>    <p>      Scientists and engineers still believe, however, that      establishing a secondary burn zone is a potentially viable      way of accomplishing the goals of higher efficiency and      reduced emissions, and much design work has been, and is      being, dedicated to perfecting the approach. One company      involved in this research is J0tul of Norway, which has      been working with both catalytic devices and secondary      combustion for almost six years. In February of 1982 J0tul      will introduce its Model 201, which will include a      secondary combustion system that preheats air to around      750Â°F.    </p>    <p>      The company's new stove is similar in concept to the wood      gasifier that powers MOTHER's pickup truck (see page 182),      and its efficient use of the pyrolytic products promises to      yield high efficiency. Jotul's own testing has shown      combustion efficiencies of between 92% and 98% over a wide      range of burn rates, though the high secondary combustion      temperatures involved can result in enough stack losses to      reduce overall efficiency to between 76% and 80% (still      very impressive figures).    </p>    <p>      From a pollution and creosote control standpoint, the 201's      high combustion efficiency should cut CO, hydrocarbon, and      particulate levels effectively. While Jotul is unwilling to      release full performance figures, the company has stated      that the stove's CO output will be less than 0.3%      (Switzerland has the most stringent current regulation,      allowing levels no higher than 1%) . At a suggested retail      of under $1,000, the 201 could prove to be a powerful tool      in the fight against emissions and creosote.    </p>    <p>      Another method of encouraging secondary combustion is used      in the Brugger Industries (of New Zealand) woodstove. The      Brugger's secondary air tube runs directly above the fire      before exhausting below a series of holes in a baffle      between the firebox and the flue. According to the      manufacturer, the system leads to the ignition and      continued consumption of volatile gases at burn rates as      low as 1-1/2 pounds of wood per hour.    </p>    <p>      An interesting development from Essex Thermodynamics      Corporation carries the secondary combustion concept to its      logical extreme. The Essex boiler is actually a downdraft      wood gasifier, in that it draws intake air down through the      fuel and creates burnable pyrolytic products as one of its      major sources of heat. The volatile gases are pulled      through the coals at the bottom of the bed (to enrich the      mixture with CO and hydrogen) and are then fired in a      ceramic-lined combustion chamber. The heat is passed on to      a water-circulation system through a series of parallel      tubes.    </p>    <p>      Several other gasification-type stoves are currently in the      works, and the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality      has performed some preliminary testing on one of them. The      unit's emission levels were somewhat lower than those of      conventional heaters, but were greater than those produced      by the hightemperature furnaces we'll discuss later in this      article. (Oregon's researchers did note some problems with      fuel bridging in the gasifier. If these are corrected, that      stove's performance could improve.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>CATALYST (ON A HOT TIN STOVE)</strong>    </p>    <p>      Scores of stoves with catalytic co mbusters have appeared      in the marketplace during the last year, as manufacturers      have attempted to provide consumers with salable      technological improvements. The honeycomb ceramic and noble      metal (platinum, for one) devices work by initiating      combustion at a lower temperature than would normally be      possible . . . without being consumed themselves. A typical      converter begins affecting the oxidation of carbon monoxide      at around 500Â°F. As temperatures rise, it helps to      ignite <em>heavier</em> combustibles as well. In practical      terms, a catalytic device makes secondary combustion occur      at temperatures that are between 300Â° and 600Â°F      lower than would normally be possible.    </p>    <p>      The performances of a number of different stoves fitted      with Corning's Catalytic Combusters are now fairly well      documented. In that testing, reductions in emissions and      increases in efficiency have been found at medium-to-high      burn rates (those of more than about five pounds per hour).      But the effectiveness of the catalyst system at low burn      rates isn't nearly as well understood. Some researchers      have found that the combusters won't "light-off" at reduced      firing levels . . . which, under normal home woodburning      conditions, would make such stoves little (or no) more      effective than conventional heaters. However, 1981-82 will      be the first full winter during which consumers will be      using such appliances, and much should be learned from the      public reaction to in-home use of catalytic      combuster-equipped woodstoves over the course of this      winter.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BURN NOW, HEAT LATER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The high-temperature furnace is probably the most      <em>thoroughly proven</em> lowemissions woodburning      approach. Dr. Richard Hill, of the University of Maine, was      the designer of the original <em>high-tur</em> bulence (as      it's often called) furnace . . . a device that achieves      excellent combustion efficiency and low emissions by      burning wood at an extremely rapid rate in a well-insulated      ceramic firebox with a forced-air intake. The fuel is      quickly consumed, and the heat is absorbed by water (in the      case of Dr. Hill's system) for storage.    </p>    <p>      The emission levels of such furnaces are quite low. They      are, in fact, comparable to those of burners fueled by oil      <em>(though they're</em> significantly lower in sulfur      content). Overall heating efficiencies of the furnaces,      however, are not much <em>higher than</em> those of      conventional stoves, since some heat is lost during the      exchange and storage stages.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ADD-ON EQUIPMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      As is the case in the automobile fuelmileage gimmick      business, there are a lot of would-be      inventors-in the woodburning industry and outwho'd      love to come up with something that a person could stick on      the outside of an existing stove to reduce emissions and/or      creosote. So far, a number of products have appeared which      are said to do just that, but accurate testing lags far      behind the claims. Unless otherwise noted, we're not      suggesting that the following devices perform as the      manufacturers <em>say</em> they do . . . we're only trying      to inform you of their existence. (Please read the boxed      announcement that accompanies this article to find out      about a testing program -covering some of these      products-that MOTHER is cosponsoring.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>TEMPERATURE</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are several items on the market that assist the      woodstove owner in monitoring the operating temperature of      his or her appliance . . . and such products <em>can</em>      help a woodburner comply with Rule 3 for clean operation:      Keep the fire hot. Furthermore, when one has a thermometer      to watch, it's an easy matter to keep track of heat output      from the comfort of an armchair. The simplest and least      expensive stove thermometer is the Chimgard bimetal coil      device made by Condar Company,(Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 6,      Hiram, Ohio <em>44234)</em> and sold through many woodstove      supply stores. The Chimney Fire Alert by Vermont      Technologies Group, Inc. (Dept. TMEN, Morrisville, Vermont      05661) is a more sophisticated temperature sensor that      consists of a thermocouple (which is inserted through the      stovepipe wall) and a remote control box. The device      includes a thermometer, but its major feature is an      adjustable alarm that signals overheating or a chimney      fire.    </p>    <p>      Yet another approach to maintaining consistent (and high)      operating -temperature in a woodstove is the thermostatic      air intake control. Many commercially available stoves come      equipped with such mechanisms, but-in general-the units      respond too slowly to maintain very even stove temperature.      The lag time in the reaction of the typical bimetal coil      causes many thermostatically controlled stoves to oscillate      <em>around</em> the desired temperature. (You may have seen      the chimney of a heater equipped with such a device      emitting puffs of smoke . . . as if the occupants of the      house were sending signals.)    </p>    <p>      However, a new thermostatic intake air regulator-developed      by Stockton Barnett, for marketing by the Condar      Company-has been designed to react very      <em>quickly</em> to changes in stove temperature. Test      results indicate that the Stovetemp is able to maintain      very even temperatures in woodstoves, and thus to eliminate      the inefficient over-and underfiring common to most      heaters. Dr. Barnett didn't measure any appreciable drop in      the amount of hydrocarbons and particulates emitted, per      pound of fuel burned, in a selection of Stovetempequipped      stoves . . . but the improved efficiency of the appliances      (which typically ran between <em>13%</em> and 20%) caused      less wood to be burned in order to warm the homes, a      condition that-in turn-leads to reduced emissions overall.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DRAFT INDUCEMENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Several different techniques have been developed to      encourage proper draft in woodstove flues. There are a,      number of chimney caps which-according to their      manufacturers-increase flue gas velocities and      thereby reduce creosote formation. (One such firm claims      that its prod uct will cut creosote accumulation by as much      as 75%.) Many advertisements also state that chimney caps      may improve combustion efficiency, which could-as an      indirect effect also result in lower emission levels.      <em>This is</em> still very much in question, however,      since an increase in flue gas velocity <em>(which</em>      might reduce creosote accumulation) wouldn't guarantee that      emissions would drop, too.    </p>    <p>      Barometric draft regulators have also caused a bit of a      stir in the marketplace over the last year. The devices      are-as you'd expect-similar in concept to oil      and gas furnace regulators. As flue gas velocity rises, a      damper opens to admit air into the chimney, which prevents      overburning caused by excessive draft <em>and</em> adds      dilution air to the stove's exhaust. As we mentioned in      reference to chimney caps, barometric draft regulators may      well reduce creosote accumulation (our research project,      being performed in conjunction with Shelton Energy      Research, is exploring that question right now), but a      lowered rate of emissions may not-in this case-go hand in      hand with a cleaner chimney.    </p>    <p>      It's also worth noting that barometric draft      regulators-if ducted from air inside the housemay      increase the overall number of air changes in a house . . .      which would, in effect, lower a stove's overall heating      efficiency. Furthermore, we believe that draft regulators      should be conveniently located <em>arid</em> equipped with      a manual override, allowing them to be shut in the event of      a chimney fire.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ADD-ON AFTERBURNERS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Two companies now sell catalytic combusters as retrofit      devices for woodstoves. Energy Harvesters is offering a      stove with what is termed the "Energy Cat" option, and the      setup can be added to the company's older models as well.      The Smoke Dragon (a product of Penn Stove), on the other      hand, can be used with many different brands of woodstoves.      However, at $350, this Corning star-unit will add      about as much to the price of a woodstove as you'd expect      to pay in supplemental charges for a      factory-installed system. If its performance is      similar to that of the other catalysts that have been      tested, the Smoke Dragon should reduce emissions and      increase the overall efficiencies of conventional      woodstoves. (The Penn Stove product is one of the devices      MOTHER and Shelton Energy Research are testing.)    </p>    <p>      The Smoke Consumer-another retrofit product-is      an add-it-to-your-stovepipe module that attempts to      accomplish goals similar to those sought by catalyst add-on      manufacturers . . . but aims to do so by different means.      Lincoln Works' product captures particulates and      hydrocarbons on a fine-mesh stainless steel filter.      Material which would have become either creosote or      pollutants is thus caught as it passes through the      convoluted passageways (the device is similar in concept to      an automobile air filter), and-if the exhaust gas      temperatures are above 300Â°F-the residues will be      burned away either on the filter or on the cast-iron      reactor plate above it. However, when the temperatures are      lower than 300Â°F, deposits will form that either must      be burned away (by a daily <em>hot</em> firing) or cleaned      off. Consequently, the Smoke Consumer's manufacturer      recommends that the screen be inspected at least once a      week, and cleaned when necessary.    </p>    <p>      Though Lincoln Works doesn't make any claims about its      product's ability to reduce emissions, it could affect both      particulate and hydrocarbon output. In addition, it's      possible that carbon mon oxide levels might also be cut by      the filter. We'd like to emphasize, however, that these are      mere speculations on our part. (The Smoke Consumer's      effectiveness as a creosote-reducing device is being      examined in the Shelton Energy Research study.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>BURN LESS WOOD</strong>    </p>    <p>      In conclusion, it should be said that the best method we      know of for lessening woodstove pollution problems, cutting      back on creosote, and easing the burden on our nation's      forests is to reduce our <em>need for heat.</em> More and      more folks tire switching to wood fuel for its economic      advantages, and in many parts of the country the load on      the environment-in the form of pollution and      deforestationhas already become critical.    </p>    <p>      So before you buy a bigger stove or head out to bring in      another cord of wood, consider the possibility of      weatherizing your house. There's a, good chance that adding      insulation. sealing cracks, and putting rip storm windows      may prove to be less expensive-in the long      run-than burning an extra grove of trees. And give      some thought to installing solar devices as well. Buying or      building them will cost dollars and energy, but once      they're in place, the sun. gatherers will usually require a      minimum of attention for years to come.    </p>    <p>      The lessons that we're now learning about woodstove      pollution are actually a reiteration of the lessons we've      already' been taught by coal, oil, gas, and uranium: Too      much of anything can be <em>an</em> problem. In the long      run, there's no substitute for doing more with less!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMING UP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Just as this issue of MOTHER was about to go to press, we      completed an agreement with Shelton Energy Research to help      fund a testing program for three devices which are      advertised to significantly reduce creosote accumulation in      stovepipes. In MOTHER NO. 73, Dr. Jay a recognized expert      in wood heating and author of <em>The Woo</em> d      <em>burner's Encyclopedia</em> <em>(among</em> other      books)-and his colleagues will describe the three      aftermarket devices that are being tested, and they'll      outline, in detail, just how the products will be examined.      Then, in issue 74, we'll bring <em>you</em> the full      results of that detailed scientific study.    </p>    <p>      After several months of work, the Shelton Energy team      should have data which <em>will</em> tell us accurately      (rather than "by guess and by gosh") just <em>how much</em>      help a catalytic combuster, a barometric draft regulator,      or a st ovepipe screen can be in keeping that persistent      woodstove gremlin, creosote, under control.    </p>
