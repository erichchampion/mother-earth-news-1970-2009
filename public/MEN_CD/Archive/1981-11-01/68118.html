                        <p>      Lately, more and more people have begun to understand just      how limited-in both variety and nutritional      value-our "modern" diets have become. This      realization has sparked a new and widespread interest in      the culinary and therapeutic uses of herbs . . . those      plants which-although not well known      today-were, just one short generation ago, honored      "guests' on the dinner tables and in the medicine chests of      our grandparents' homes. In this regular feature, MOTHER      will examine the availability, cultivation, and benefits of      our "forgotten" vege table foods and rem edies . . .      and-we hope-help pre vent the loss of still      another bit of an cestral lore.    </p>    <p>      Ginger can be any of various perennial plants of the      Zingiberaceae family (which includes cardamom and turmeric,      among others), but Zingiber officinale is the "proper" or      commercial product most familiar to us. Unfortunately for      gardeners In the temperate zones, ginger grows only in hot,      wet, tropical areas of the world . . . such as parts of      India, China, Nigeria, Queensland (Australia), and Jamaica.      North America hosts unrelated plants, known as wild ginger      (Asarum <em>canadense and</em> other species), with a      similar-though milder-odor and taste, which can      be used for medicinal and culinary purposes.    </p>    <p>      Reedlike and somewhat exotic-looking, with its      leaf-sheathed stem and spikes of yellow flowers, ginger      grows three to five feet tall and has 6 to 12-inch pointed      leaves. The thick rootor rhizome-is whitish or      buffcolored, aromatic, and knotty.    </p>        <p>      According to some authorities, ginger was brought from Asia      to the Mediterranean by Roman soldiers around the first      century A.D., and all agree that the spice had become quite      popular in England by the eleventh century. The Spaniards      introduced it to the West Indies shortly after the      discoveries of Columbus, and the spice was carried to      continental North America by the Pilgrims.    </p>    <p>      From the sixteenth to the eighteenth centuries, ginger was      a common-and sometimes overwhelming!-ingredient      in everyday meals. The spice was used in such quantities      that people must have sometimes found it difficult to      identify the underlying substance of a dish. One entree,      for instance, specified that two kinds of ginger be chopped      up with the meat, which was then cooked in a batter of . .      . more ginger.    </p>    <p>      Thanks in part to the introduction of sugar as a common      food additive and to the marketing philosophy of the      industrial revolution (more sales and a smaller selection),      the enormous variety of seasonings typical of medieval and      Renaissance cuisine dwindled to a bare handful . . . but      ginger survived, and is still popular today.    </p>        <p>      As a flavoring, the spice can be used fresh, dried (ground      or cracked), candied, or preserved in syrup. It's a key      ingredient in many Chinese dishes, as well as in the famous      curries and condiments of southeast Asia.    </p>    <p>      Traditional health care uses abound, as well: Ginger tea      stimulates the appetite before dinner, and is said to      relieve gas afterward . . . a ginger plaster is reputed to      cure a dull headache . . . and chewing a piece of fresh      ginger root is supposed to relieve a toothache.    </p>    <p>      There are many fine recipes based upon this delightful      spice (see page 8 for a selection). The following, called      "Crown of Gingerbread" (adaptedwith permission-from <em>The      Bread Tray</em> by Louis de Gouy) proved especially popular      with MOTHER's staff: Stir 3/4 cup of brown sugar into 3/4      cup of dark molasses. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE:</em> If      substituting <em>honey, use</em> whatever conversion      formula works for you, but do try to find a dark honey.      <em>Remember, too,</em> that the flavor will be affected by      the substitution.] Add 2 well-beaten eggs, and mix the      ingredients briskly for one minute. Stir in 3/4 cup of      melted lard or vegetable shortening, and blend well.    </p>    <p>      Next, sift together 2-1/2 cups of bread flour, 2 teaspoons      of baking powder, 2 teaspoons of ground ginger, 1-1/2      teaspoons of cinnamon, 1/2 teaspoon of cloves, 1/2 teaspoon      of nutmeg, a generous 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda, and 1/2      teaspoon of salt. Sift the dry mix again, this time over      the combined liquid ingredients . . . alternately adding a      total of 1 cup of boiling water. Beat to form a smooth      batter, then pour it into a greased ring mold or tube pan      and bake the dessert for 35 to 40 minutes at 350Â°F,      until it's firm. If desired, fill the center hole with      cut-up fruit, whipped cream, or pudding . . and watch your      crew wolf it down!    </p>
