                <p>      The Wilderness Skills Schools, Part III</p>					<p>		<strong><em>A short course in tracking, nature<br />      and wilderness survival</em></strong></p>      <h5 id="byline">By Terry Krautwurst<br /> Photographed by William Waldron    </h5>        <p>      I'm standing at the upper edge of an overgrown hillside, a      few sloping acres of knee-high grasses and brush in rural      western New Jersey. Above, half a dozen raucous crows play      in a blue sky-the definitive blue sky, cloudless,      crystal clear. Along the lower edge of the field huge oaks      and willows rise above lesser foliage, their boughs arcing      over a wide river, dappling the water in leafy shadow.    </p>    <p>      A typical countryside scene-unless you include the 40      or so human posteriors and pairs of legs grazing in groups      scattered across the field. The bodies to which they're      connected are thrust out of sight into bushes and briars      and grasses, heads hidden like-well, no, not a bit      like ostrich heads hidden in the sand. Hardly evading the      world, these people are deep in discovering it.    </p>    <p>      This is the next-to-last day of a six-day Standard      (introductory) course at the Tom Brown School of Tracking,      Nature and Wilderness Survival.    </p>    		 <p>      An excited voice emerges from somewhere in a clump of      sedge. "Tom! I found something! I think it's a weasel      hair!" A hand pops up, then a head. "Wow, look at this!"      another voice, belonging to a bluejeaned backside, shouts.      "Hey, I think I found a sleeping chamber!" someone else      hollers. "Look at all these trails!" an awed voice      exclaims, its legs snaking deeper into the vegetation.    </p>    <p>      The excitement of discovery is contagious, and, dropping to      my knees, I gladly shed my role as observer/journalist,      part a layer of matted grass, poke my head downward and      join my fellow students in a heretofore unseen world. "I'll      be damned," I whisper to myself as I immediately uncover a      tiny, wellworn path-too small for rabbits, probably a      vole run-winding around a sapling and meandering      downhill. "Would you look at that."    </p>    <p>      Belly down, nose inches from the ground, I study the      two-inch-wide trail, a Lilliputian highway paved with grass      pummeled smooth by countless wee footsteps. The closer I      look, the more I am drawn into life in this grass forest,      and the more I see: some droppings here, a hair there, some      tiny scratch marks, a rounded, nestlike chamber. Carefully      replacing the thatch above one section before parting the      vegetation over the next-as our instructors have      repeatedly reminded us to do-I trace the tunnel      downhill. Every few feet it intersects other paths, some      hidden, some exposed, some larger, some smaller-roads      traveled by mice, deer, foxes, ground hogs, raccoons.      Together, I realize, they form an amazing network, a sort      of macrovascular system pulsing with animal movement, that      must cover the entire field, and-good Lord, think of      it-all the fields adjoining this one, and all those      adjoining them.    </p>        <p>      Transfixed, I slither further into the underbrush.    </p>    <p>      Some minutes later, a sonorous voice breaks the spell. "OK,      people, gather round." I stand up, blinking in the      sunlight, in time to see my fellow students emerge, heads      popping up through the vegetation one by one, like      surfacing scuba divers. We assemble around our mentor, Tom      Brown, Jr., himself.    </p>    <p>      At 37, Brown is a teacher, author and living legend. He      looks the part. Over six feet tall, he stands ramrod      straight, a blue T-shirt stretched across a broad chest and      powerful biceps. His hair, showing streaks of silvergray,      is cut short, military style-a far cry from the      flowing tresses he has worn until only a few months ago.      His eyes are steel blue, piercing, always darting, never      focusing for long on any one person or thing.    </p>    <p>      Brown became a national figure in 1976, when his first      book, <em>The Tracker,</em> was published. <em>The      Tracker</em> tells the extraordinary story of Brown's      childhood, spent in the New Jersey Pine Barrens under the      tutelage of an elderly displaced Apache scout named      Stalking Wolf. From the time he was seven years old, he was      trained by Stalking Wolf in the old ways, the traditional      skills and philosophies of Native Americans. Brown      believes, in retrospect, that he was chosen by Stalking      Wolf to pass along the ancient teachings and skills.    </p>    		<p>      In 1977 he started this school, today probably the      best-known and largest wilderness survival and tracking      school in the country. He has also written a set of field      guides, a second autobiographical book, <em>The Search</em>      (a third is in the works), and countless magazine articles,      including a popular series, "At Home in the Wilderness,"      for MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      But even before he started the school or wrote his first      book, Brown was known among law enforcement and government      agencies as "The Tracker." His exploits in finding      criminals and lost children, sometimes staying on the trail      without provisions for days, are epic. He is widely      acknowledged <em>as the</em> best tracker in the country,      period.    </p>    <p>      This week, though, he is our teacher, our medicine man, our      Stalking Wolf.    </p>    <p>      Brown gestures with a sweep of his arm to the field and      meadows adjoining. "People travel hundreds of miles to      crowd into places like Yosemite or Yellowstone to see the      wildlife," he says, "when there's so much to see and      appreciate right in their own back yards. A field like this      contains every bit as much wildlife, every bit as much      natural diversity and variety, as any park anywhere in the      country. And all you have to do is learn how to look for      it. That's all. Just learn how to look and see."    </p>    <p>      We have spent countless hours this week doing just that,      and a great deal more. In five days of almost nonstop      lectures and workshops-beginning at 8:00 each morning      and continuing into the night, sometimes past      midnight-we've covered an astonishing variety of      skills, each in depth: making fires, building shelters,      finding water, building traps and snares, skinning and      tanning, making natural cordage, cooking, arrow and bow      making, flint knapping, Eolithic rockwork, stalking,      foraging, hunting and-of course-tracking.    </p>    <p>      "I pack this course with information, and then I pack it      further," Brown told us the first night. "Time is critical      here. I use every minute. When you're done on Sunday and      you look at how much we've gone over, your head will reel."    </p>    <p>      My head's been reeling since the second day. I've filled      two notebooks with lecture notes and I'm working on      another. My hands are scratched and calloused from      workshops: from carving traps, twisting plant fiber to make      cord, chipping rock into cutting tools.    </p>    <p>      After lunch, each student uses the time remaining before      the next class to practice skills or complete projects      started earlier. An options trader from Brooklyn pulls a      nearly completed bone arrowhead from his pocket and begins      scraping it across a piece of rock to give it a keen edge.      In the field beyond the cooking area, three      students-a real estate salesman, a machinist and a      physical therapist-set chunks of firewood on end in a      line as targets, move back 30 feet and practice throwing a      rabbit stick, an arm-length, wrist-thick piece of tree limb      that, when hurled correctly, is a deadly accurate survival      weapon for hunting small game.    </p>    <p>      Over by an outbuilding another student stands staring      straight ahead, arms outstretched to either side, wiggling      his fingers slightly. It's an exercise in stimulating      peripheral vision, an element, Brown says, essential to      increasing your awareness of the world. He has taught us to      widen our vision and avoid fixing our eyes in any one      direction for long-a technique he calls "splatter      vision." "Always be a tourist," he says. "Look at the room      you're in, the street you're on, the trail you're walking,      as if you were seeing it for the first time-no matter      how many times you've seen it before. Your mind always      seeks the familiar, but you miss so much. Vary your vision.      Refuse to let your eyes focus on the same things you always      look at. Force yourself to look in different places.      Wherever your vision goes, your senses go."    </p>    <p>      Other students are at the edge of a cornfield, practicing      the graceful, excruciatingly slow movements we've learned      for stalking. Still another is down on all fours, notebook      at side, imitating the basic animal walking motions Brown      has taught us. "You can't track an animal if you don't      understand how it moves," he says.    </p>    <p>      A shrill squeaking sound-wood rubbing against      wood-comes from behind me, and I cringe. I don't have      to look to know that it's a student working a bow drill,      the basic survival fire-starting apparatus consisting of a      notched fireboard, a dowellike spindle, a handhold, a small      bow and a tinder bundle. Making one, then starting a fire      with it, was our first workshop. In typical Brown fashion,      we were provided a chunk of cedar, the least desirable of      acceptable woods. "If you can get a bow drill fire going      with cedar," Brown says, "you can get one going with any of      the better woods."    </p>    <p>      I'm embarrassed to be one of the few students who have yet      to succeed. I sigh. What the heck, I'll try again. I get      the drill I've made. I fluff up the tinder bundle and lay      it on the floor, place the fireboard over it, wrap the      bow's cord around the spindle, position the spindle's      bottom end on the board, put the handhold on the top end.    </p>    <p>      OK. Left foot anchors the fireboard. Right knee behind left      foot. Chest down tight against thigh, left arm braced      across shin. Start sawing with the bow, easy at first, back      and forth. Now pick up a little speed. Back and forth, back      and forth. Faster. Push down harder on the spindle. There,      some smoke. A little faster, bear down a little harder (I'm      running out of breath, my arm's cramping). More smoke.      Good, faster now, faster; push down a little harder . . .      pop, clatter . . . the spindle flies off the board and      across the room, just as it has countless times before.      Feeling beaten, I walk over and pick the spindle up,      forgetting that the end is hot, and burn my      hand-injury added to insult.    </p>    <p>      Just then Frank, one of the school's instructors, comes      around the corner. "Did you get your fire yet?" he asks      jovially. I grimace. "Look," he says, "let's get together      after tonight's lecture and see if we can't figure out what      you're doing wrong."    </p>    <p>      "Nah, thanks, that's OK," I say, shrugging. "I'll just      practice when I get home. It's not that important, no big      deal."    </p>    <p>      I lie.    </p>    <p>      The afternoon's tracking lecture, like those before it, is      electrifying. When Brown talks tracking, his voice shakes      with excitement, his eyes burn with intensity, he paces      back and forth, his hand flies across the blackboard to      illustrate a point. He is obsessed with tracking and admits      it. As a child, he developed a callus across his lower      chest from spending so much time crawling on the ground      poring over tracks.    </p>    <p>      "Every mark is a track," Brown teaches. "Everything that is      not flat is a track; the Grand Canyon is a water track, a      fallen tree is a track of the heartrot that killed it and      of the wind that felled it. Every dent, pocket, fissure,      scrape, mark in the ground, every rolling hill, every      scratch is a track. The ground is a manuscript, an open      book; it is littered with tracks, from the largest to the      smallest, and each one tells you something."    </p>    <p>      To me, the lectures are a revelation. Brown's teaching goes      way beyond merely identifying foot or paw prints in the      dirt. "Earth mother gives you a clear print to follow maybe      5% of the time," he says. He teaches us compression      tracking-identifying vague depressions in the ground      or deep leaf litter or thin dust by their general shape and      the patterns in which they're arranged.    </p>    <p>      Then he moves to an even more subtle art, the reading of      what Brown calls pressure releases, the characteristic ways      the earth compresses, cracks, crumbles, moves, responds to      a foot or paw. There are hundreds of them, and each means      something different. There is a single release that      indicates an increase in speed from slow jog to jog,      another for a slight turn of the head to the right, another      for a momentary hesitation (perhaps the person or animal      considered changing direction for an instant, then decided      otherwise). Pressure releases tell all.    </p>    		 <p>      "From one footprint," says Brown, "I can tell a person's      height and weight, gender, emotional state, condition of      health and degree of strength. I can tell whether they're      right- or left-handed, whether their stomach is full or      empty, whether they have to go to the bathroom. I can even      tell a few days before a person gets a cold, because      there's a r estriction in breathing."    </p>    <p>      The lecture lasts well into the evening. Brown's energy      never abates. He draws dozens of release patterns on the      blackboard. He steps into a tracking box-sort of a      pro quality sandbox-and demonstrates how even subtle      body movements are revealed in prints. He is unrelenting.      He sketches more releases. He tells us of releases within      releases, of microreleases. We learn that all of the      releases we've discussed can be created not only by a foot      or paw, but by individual toes, by each lobe of an animal's      heel pad.    </p>    <p>      It's simply too much for a mortal to absorb. By the time we      file out, I've filled my third notebook and I'm brain dead,      the victim of a tracking fanatic. I take advantage of a      rare lull in activities and tumble into my sleeping bag.    </p>    <p>      Later that evening, an hour before we're scheduled to      partake in a traditional sweat lodge ceremony-a      culmination of the week's lessons-I walk into the      wrong room at the wrong time. A half dozen students are      standing in a loose circle cheering, and in the center a      student who hadn't yet managed to get a bow drill fire      going is holding a flaming tinder bundle.    </p>    <p>      They see me before I can back away. "OK, Terry, you're      next! You can do it! You've got to do it! Think fire! Think      fire!" Before I know it, I'm in the one place in the world      I least want to be, kneeling over a cold, hard fireboard,      bow in hand.    </p>    <p>      I start sawing away, back and forth, back and forth.      There's a wisp of smoke. I saw faster. More smoke. "Go!      Go!" the people in the background are chanting. I push down      harder, saw faster. A little more smoke. Back and forth,      back and forth, for what seems an eternity. Suddenly the      smoke billows and someone shouts, "You've got a coal,      you've got a coal!" I drop the bow, grab a toothpick-size      twig and gently nudge the coal into the tinder bundle.      Carefully, I pick up the bundle, cradle the coal inside the      fibers and bring the tinder to my lips. I blow gently. The      coal glows red, the tinder smokes. I blow again. It glows      redder. I blow again. The coal turns bright      orange-and dies. A groan goes up from the cheering      section.    </p>    <p>      But I know what I've done wrong, and I'm already sawing      away again by the time my coaches are telling me: "Feed the      coal! You've got to keep the tinder all around the coal!"      The smoke billows again, I get a coal again, I tip it into      the tinder and bring the bundle to my lips again. I fill my      lungs with air and blow it out, long and steady. The coal      burns orange. I press the tinder inward, take another      breath, blow it out. More burn, more smoke. I keep the      rhythm going. Breathe in, blow out, more tinder, breathe      in, blow out. The smoke thickens and someone whispers,      "He's got it, he's got it." Breathe in, blow out, breathe      in, blow-whoosh! The bundle bursts into flames!    </p>    <p>      I am no shouter; at football games, a muttered "All right"      is the most I can manage when the home team makes a      touchdown. But at the sight of that fire, that astonishing      flame created from nothing, something way down inside of me      wells up and before I can catch myself I'm standing and      shrieking like a banshee, announcing with a triumphant      primal scream that I've made fire.    </p>    <p>      It is a night for profound experiences. In the sweat lodge,      there is no light, and in the darkness no up or down, no      sense of space or time. There is only the      heat-intense, purifying, drawing water from our      bodies-and the rhythm of our breathing, of Brown's      voice chanting, of ebb and flow. "Every drop of water      contains a little bit of the ocean," Brown has told us. "In      the sweat lodge you can feel the ancient pull of the tide,      reminding you of your origins and of the unity of all      life."    </p>    <p>      We emerge from the lodge into a cold, bright, crystalline      night. I stand under the stars, throw my head back to the      sky and bask.    </p>    <p>      By 9:00 the next morning we're on our hands and knees out      in front of the barn with Brown, tracking mice across the      farm's hardpacked gravel driveway. I can't see the tracks      Brown points out until I heed his instructions: "Always      keep the track between you and the light, get close to the      ground, and look at the surface at a severe angle." I lean      way down, my eye an inch or two above the ground, low      morning sun opposite. There; so subtle they're barely more      than a reflection, the crucifix-like compression shapes      characteristic of rodents.    </p>    <p>      An hour later we're back in the classroom. Most of us have      to leave soon. "I have a confession to make," Brown says.      "I brought you here on false pretenses. You came here to      learn survival skills, and I've taught you those skills. I      know that with what you've learned you'll be able to      survive, quite comfortably, anywhere in the country as long      as it's not a parking lot. But that's not why I spent this      week with you." He pauses. His voice shakes with emotion.      "I believe we're fighting a desperate war to save what's      left of the earth from destruction. The earth is our      mother. She is lying raped and dying by the side of the      road. She needs our help. We have to help, or she'll die,      and we with her.    </p>    <p>      "I believe that teaching survival gets to people's hearts,      that when a person learns how to enter the world purely,      unencumbered by society, where you live a hand-to-mouth      existence with the earth, a connection develops. That's why      I run this school, to bring as many people as possible back      to the earth, and to send them out to teach other people."    </p>    <p>      Brown speaks slowly, pleadingly. "I hope that when you go      home you will have a new love and respect for the earth,      that you will have a commitment to help save it, and that      you will help bring others back close to the earth. Please,      people, take what you have learned here this week and teach      others. Time is running out."    </p>    <p>      The room is silent, charged with passion and purpose.    </p>    <p>      By late afternoon, I'm on a crowded bus headed back to the      Newark Airport, Brown's words still ringing in my ears. I'm      leaving the school with far more than I expected.    </p>    <p>      Am I an expert tracker? No, that'll take time. But I've got      an awfully good start. I've acquired survival skills that I      know will keep me alive should I ever need them, and that      in any case will allow me to hike, camp or otherwise enter      the natural world free of worry, free of what Brown calls      the "what if" question: What if I lose my backpack, what if      I break my leg . . . And I'll be able to teach those same      skills to my wife and children and friends.    </p>    <p>      Most important, though, I've gained a greater sense of my      place in the world and a heightened awareness of the life      around me. I have begun, in a small way, to feel what the      Native Americans called "the spirit that moves in all      things."    </p>    <p>      The bus pulls into the Newark Airport, a hubbub of concrete      and cars. It has been quite a week.    </p>    <p>      Editor's Note: Tuition for the six-day Standard Class at      the Tom Brown School of Tracking, Nature and Wilderness      Survival is $515. Classes are held once or twice a month      throughout the year beginning in April. For further      information and a schedule of classes, write The Tracker,      P.O.
