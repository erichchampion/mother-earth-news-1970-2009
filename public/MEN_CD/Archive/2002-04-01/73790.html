                <p>      <strong>OLD TRACTORS</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Inexpensive and reliable, these sturdy old</em>      <em>gray tractors can still get the job done.</em> <em>What      kind of guarantee comes with this?" I asked, suspiciously      eyeing the few drops of oil on the pavement under the rear      axle of an old gray Ford tractor.</em>    </p>        <p>      "Well, none, actually," replied the man who had it sitting      out by the road with a for sale sign. "What you see is what      you get where is, as is."    </p>    <p>      The tractor in question was a 1946 Ford x 2N (see photo,      Page 103). The four-cylinder engine had been overhauled a      few years earlier, he said. Then an old      Pennsylvania-Dutchman, who probably bought it new when      Truman was president, traded it in on a new Kubota.    </p>        <p>      The old gray tractors-the result of a partnership that      later dissolved into the separate Ford and Ferguson lines      revolutionized postwar farming. These classics have held up      to time, held onto collectors' hearts and held their value      ever since.    </p>    <p>      The roadside seller's price was $1,795. That was about 2Y2      times what the Ford cost new in 1946. But it was also about      the going rate at the time. So even though the tractor was      older than me or my wife, Melanie, we bought it on the spot      after a test drive.    </p>    <p>      That was in 1984, when we bought our land. We have used the      old Ford almost continuously ever since. We never regretted      the purchase. With a minimum of service and repairs-lots of      grease, irregular oil changes, some new wiring and radiator      hoses the 2N has never failed us. Equipped with a      two-bottom plow, 5-foot rotary mower, disk harrow and      scraper blade, it has done all we asked of it, everything      from plowing snow off of our 600-foot driveway to mowing or      titling the better part of our 20 acres, year after year.      And all for less than what most suburbanites spend these      days on a riding lawn mower.    </p>    <p>      Even if the price had been higher, we probably would have      bought it. I'm a sucker for old gray tractors. My late      grandfather had an old Ford he used to clip pastures with a      clattering sickle bar. My 78-year-old father, Don, still      uses an old gray tractor to plow snow and mow at his place      in Delaware, Ohio. It's a Ferguson TO-30 made in 1951-the      year I was born. I learned at 10 to drive on that tractor,      under Dad's close supervision, of course.    </p>    <p>      Dad got the tractor in 1956, not long after he bought 15      acres just west of Delaware and put up one of the first      pole barns in the area. "I took it on a trade, sight      unseen, as credit on a down payment on a piece of real      estate," he recalls. "The buyer was $1,100 short. He      offered me the tractor with a two-bottom plow, rear manure      scoop and a two-row cultivator.    </p>        <p>      "I needed the tractor. He needed the money and had no more      use for the tractor. I sold the plow and cultivator for      maybe $250 and traded the back loader in on a rotary mower.      The rear scoop never amounted to much. It has been a good      tractor. We have been well satisfied with it."    </p>    <p>      Today his Ferguson is worth $2,500 to $3,000, says Dad. He      should know. He sold hundreds of old gray tractors at      auction for 48 years before he retired as an auctioneer in      1996. He didn't think twice about spending $600 on engine      work after his Ferguson began burning oil.    </p>    <p>      Dad says he never really thought about buying a new      tractor. "Those old Fords and Fergusons and the old Farmall      Cubs, I wouldn't say there is any better on the market.      It's amazing how well they have held up mechanically. Of      course, there is not a whole lot to them."    </p>    <p>      Therein lies the true beauty and lasting appeal of old      tractors. They are incredibly simple, purely functional.      They are easy to work on. You can reach just about any part      with an ordinary socket wrench or screwdriver. Unlike      modern machines, they don't have cupholders, just a small      toolbox for quick fixes in the field. There is no onboard      computer, no fancy fuel injectors to 6` foul. Nothing is      plastic, except for insulation on the wiring. The whole      tractor, from its original seat to the grill, is solid      steel or thick iron. Like an old stone barn with hand-hewn      beams, they were built to last, enduring monuments to      craftsmanship and common sense.    </p>    <p>      That's why these tractors are as versatile as they are      plain. They handle a wide range of implements-two-bottom      plow, disk, hiller, mower, cultivator, rake, loader,      scraper blade, post hole digger, planter, corn      picker-without any special adaptors or complex adjustments.      They can power an irrigation pump or a buzz saw for bucking      firewood.    </p>    <p>      "The nice part about these old tractors is that you can buy      parts for any of them. You can buy manuals. That has helped      maintain their value," says Dad. "It's nothing you're going      to cash in and retire on, but as long as we can hold a      reasonably good economy they're going to keep their value.      If the economy gets worse they might even increase in      value."    </p>    <p>      The 2001 Value-Bilt Agricultural and Tractor Parts Catalog      [(888) 828-32761 has 60 pages of parts for every Ferguson      and Ford tractor made, starting with the Fordson, which      first rolled off of Ford's assembly line in 1917. You can      buy everything from axles to voltage regulators. Shop      manuals are available from Intertec Publishing [P.O. Box      12901, Overland Park, KS 66282-2901;      <em>www.z'ntertecsales.com/      intertecbooks/Companies.asp]</em> For other parts      suppliers, prices and Web pages for both makes of tractors,      check out <em>Farmcollector.com</em> or      <em>www.ytmag.com.</em>    </p>    <p>      Which is the better tractor, the Ford or the Ferguson?    </p>    <p>      "They're both so similar that they're like identical      twins," says Dad. That's not surprising, considering they      had the same parents: Henry Ford and an inventive Irishman      named Harry Ferguson.    </p>    <p>      Everyone knows Ford for his automobiles. But the man who      gave us the assembly line and the Tin Lizzie also had a      secret passion: eliminating the drudgery of farm work he      endured as a child walking endless miles behind horse-drawn      plows. He began tinkering with tractors as early as 1905.      Ford went through 62 different designs before he found what      he was looking for. In 1917 he introduced the Fordson      tractor: "To make farming what it ought to be, the most      pleasant and profitable profession in the world," the ads      read.    </p>    <p>      More than 500,000 Fords had been produced by 1925. Then      came the Great Depression. Tractor sales plunged. Ford quit      making tractors in the United States in 1928.    </p>    <p>      Ten years later, Ford linked up with Ferguson. With a      simple handshake they agreed to add Ferguson's three-point      hydraulic lift system to Ford's redesigned tractor. Farmers      could raise and lower heavy implements from the tractor      seat with the touch of a small lever. "As advanced as jet      propulsion," Ferguson ads later described it. Hooking up an      implement took only a minute.    </p>    <p>      The Ford 9N cost $585 new in 1939. It boasted 23      horsepower, three forward speeds and one color-gray. Sales      brochures said it was "designed to replace the horse." The      tractor was so quiet Ford said it should come with a radio.    </p>    <p>      Ford and Ferguson kept tinkering. They introduced the      improved Ford 2N in 1942. (Wartime models had only steel      wheels, a magneto and hand crank, instead of a battery.) By      the mid-1940s, tractors outnumbered horses and mules on      American farms for the first time.    </p>    <p>      The famous "handshake agreement" and Ford-Ferguson tractors      came to an end with Henry Ford's death in 1947. Nearly      300,000 9Ns and 2Ns were on America's farms by then. Ford's      heirs dumped Ferguson. In 1948 they introduced the 8N, the      classic four-speed, "red belly" Ford. Ferguson filed a $340      million lawsuit against Ford and began making tractors      under his own name.    </p>    <p>      Ferguson settled his suit against Ford for about $10      million in 1952. By the end of that year, Ford had made      more than 500,000 8Ns. Ferguson then merged with      Massey-Harris, which produced both M-H and Ferguson      tractors until about 1958 when the company became      Massey-Ferguson. Ferguson died in 1960.    </p>        <p>      Collector Jim Storment of Mt. Vernon, Illinois, has one of      every model Ferguson made in the United States. (Visit his      Web site at <em>www.mountvernon.net/</em> tractor.) He      recently paid $2,600 for a TO-30 with a front-end loader at      auction. Depending on condition, prices can range from less      than $1,000 for a handy person's special to $5,000 or more      for a fully restored tractor. "If it starts and runs fairly      decent, that's a good starting point," Storment says of      evaluating old gray tractors.    </p>    <p>      "If it smokes pretty bad you know you have some engine work      to do. Almost all of them have damage down at the bottom of      the grill where the hood tips forward. If it had a bumper,      the grill didn't get all mashed in. If they're kept inside      that makes a big difference in the overall condition. Check      for fresh paint. That can hide a multitude of sins."    </p>        <p>      For more weight and better traction, the rear tires of our      2N are filled with a calcium chloride solution. Tire chains      are essential for working in snow and ice, especially on      any kind of slope. Dad has front wheel weights on his      TO-30. "From the safety angle that's a necessity, in my      opinion," he says. "It only takes a matter of seconds for a      tractor to flip completely over backwards and kill the      driver."    </p>    <p>      To our 2N we added a weighted gas cap, which helps relieve      potentially explosive pressure caused by the fuel tank      being located directly above the engine. An overrunning      coupler keeps power take off (PTO) implements like our Bush      Hog mower from pushing the tractor forward when the clutch      is depressed.    </p>    <p>      To keep the radiator from plugging up with seeds and chaff,      we wrapped it and the grill with window screen. Thanks to      the 2N, our organic vegetable operation has steadily grown      over the years. 13y 1997 the farm had finally reached the      point where we needed a newer tractor with better gearing,      so we could use a PTO-powered tiller, mulch layer and      other, more modern labor-saving implements.    </p>    <p>      We bought a used John Deere 1050 diesel from Gunther      Heussman, a neighboring farmer who also sells used      equipment. We thought seriously about trading our 2N.    </p>    <p>      Heussman even came out and looked it over. He liked what he      saw, even though it still drips a bit of oil from the rear      axle. He offered us $1,800-$5 more than we had paid for it      13 years earlier.    </p>    <p>      I was really tempted, but just couldn't bring myself to let      go. If Heussman gave us $1,800, I figured he would resell      it, probably to a collector, for maybe $2,500. More than      the money, though, I was haunted by the vague notion that,      some day, another 10-year-old DeVault might learn to drive      on an old gray Ford. Blame Henry Ford.    </p>    <p>      In sales brochures from 60 years ago, Ford vowed that with      the Ford-Ferguson tractor, "The slavery wilt be taken out      of agriculture. It will become attractive and profitable      and put an end to the disastrous drift of youth from the      land. It will cut production costs, keep down food prices      for consumers, boost the overall economy and lay the      foundation for greater National Security."<br />    </p>    <p>      Makes sense to me. If ever there were a time America needed      all that and more, it is now. Old Fords and Fergusons are      perfect starter tractors. The right place for them today is      not in museums or collectors' climate-controlled barns, but      in the fields and the hands of new, young farmers.    </p>    <p>      MOTHER    </p>    <p>      contributing editor George DeVault farms and writes at his      20-acre organic farm in Emmaus, Pennsylvania. His wife,      Mel, reports he is not yet quite as gray as his old Ford.    </p>
