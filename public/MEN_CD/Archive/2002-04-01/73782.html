                    <h5 id="byline">      by Merge Piercy    </h5>        <h3>      What calls louder than the cry of a field of corn      ready, or trees of ripe peaches?    </h3>    <p>      The small ears prick on the bushes,<br />      furry buds, shoots tender and pale.<br />      The swamp maples blow scarlet.<br />      Color teases the corner of the eye,<br />      delicate gold, chartreuse, crimson,<br />    mauve speckled, just dashed on.</p>    <p> The soil stretches naked. All winter<br />      hidden under the down comforter of snow,<br />      delicious now, rich in the hand<br />      as chocolate cake: the fragrant busy<br />      soil the worm passes through her gut<br />      and the beetle swims in like a lake.</p>    <p>      As I kneel to put the seeds in<br />      careful as stitching, I am in love.<br />      You are the bed we all sleep on.<br />      You are the food we eat, the food<br />      we ate, the food we will become.<br />    We are walking trees rooted in you. </p>    <p>You can live thousands of years<br />      undressing in the spring your black<br />      body, your red body, your brown body<br />      penetrated by the rain. Here<br />      is the goddess unveiled,<br />      the earth opening her strong thighs.</p>    <p> Yet you grow exhausted with bearing<br />      too much, too soon, too often, just<br />      as a woman wears through like an old rug.<br />      We have contempt for what we spring<br />      from. Din, we say, you're dirt<br />      as if we were not all your children.</p>    <p> We have lost the simplest gratitude.<br />      We lack the knowledge we showed ten<br />      thousand years past, that you live<br />      a goddess but mortal, that what we take<br />      must be returned; that the poison we drop<br />    in you will stunt our children's growth.</p>    <p> Tending a plot of your flesh binds<br />      me as nothing ever could, to the seasons,<br />      to the will <em>of</em> the plants, clamorous<br />      in their green tenderness. What<br />      calls louder than the cry of a field<br />      of corn ready, or trees of ripe peaches?</p>    <p>I worship on my knees, laying<br />      the seeds in you, that worship rooted<br />      in need, in hunger, in kinship,<br />      flesh of the planet with my own flesh,<br />      a ritual of compost, a litany of manure.<br />      My garden's a chapel, but a meadow<br />      gone wild in grass and flower<br />      is a cathedral. How you seethe<br />      with little quick ones, vole, field<br />      mouse, shrew and mole in their thousands,<br />      rabbits and woodchuck. In you rest<br />    the jewels of the genes wrapped in seed. </p>    <p>Power warps because it involves joy<br />      in domination; also because it means<br />      forgetting how we too starve, break<br />      like a corn stalk in the wind, how we<br />      die like the spinach of drought,<br />      how what slays the vole slays us. </p>    <p>      Because you can die of overwork, because<br />      you can die of the fire that melts<br />      rock, because you can die of the poison<br />      that kills the beetle and the slug.<br />      we must come again and worship you<br />      on our knees, the common living dirt.    </p>    <p>      <em>Â© 1983 By Marge Piercy, from</em> Stone, Paper,      Knife. <em>Used by permission of Alfred A.
