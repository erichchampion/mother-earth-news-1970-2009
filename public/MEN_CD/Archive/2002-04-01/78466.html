                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Please inform your readers who are thinking about      buying a do-it-yourself metal building to ask for the      construction manual</strong> <strong><em>before</em> they      buy.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Some manufacturers are misleading in their ads. By      studying the manual first, one can find out if the      manufacturer's idea of do-it-yourself is the same as yours.      This will help prevent unexpected headaches and expenses,      such as having to hire extra people to help put the      building together. Also, potential buyers can check out the      metal building's foundation requirements. They can be more      complicated and expensive than you think. Take this advice      from someone who has learned the hard way.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><br /></strong> <em>CURTIS JOHNSON<br /></em>      <em>Bucyrus, Ohio</em>    </p>
