                    <h2 id="subtitle">      Independence on 5-acre farm    </h2>    <p>      Ah, the vicissitudes of time. Two years ago, when there      were NO currently relevant small-scale-farming introductory      handbooks available, many of us welcomed the publication of      Richard Langer's Grow !t! with open arms. Now that we're      all older and more experienced, however, some folks find it      increasingly easy to criticize that breakthrough beginner's      guide (see the Feedback sections of MOTHER NOS. 23, 24 and      25).    </p>    <p>      Which brings us to another breakthrough book that is just      as important (probably more so) now as Grow !t! was two      years ago and which may well come up for its share of      criticism in another 24 months or so. Be that as it may,      John and Sally Deymour's record of 18 successful years on a      shirttail-sized homestead in England is important now and      should offer welcome encouragement to today's      back-to-the-landers both real and imaginary. I started      serializing the book in my No. 25 issue and I'm sure that      many readers will want a personal copy for their home      libraries.-MOTHER.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARLEY, BEER</strong> I view the tea drinking as a      destroyer of health,<br />an enfeebler of the frame, an      engenderer of effeminacy and<br />laziness, a debaucher of youth      and maker of misery for<br />Oki oar.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILLIAM COBBETT:</strong> Cottage Economy    </p>    <p>      Arid nowadays we get people worrying themselves about a      little pot. But whether we agree with Cobbett about the      evils of tea or not (he thought the clatter of the tea      tackle was the short road to the brothel and the gallows!)      we must agree with him as to the wholesomeness of good beer      brewed from good malt, made from good barley, flavoured      with good hops, and fermented with good yeast. What could      be more 'natural' than that?    </p>    <h3>      BARLEY    </h3>    <p>      And so to grow the good barley-the basis of it all. Barley      is traditionally grown after the root break, and in the      days of High Farming after roots had been fed off to folded      sheep, and the latter had trodden the ground and enriched      it with their manure. On the light lands of Norfolk the      effect of sheep used thus was termed the 'Golden Hoof'. The      very finest malting barley, however, is that grown after      another white straw crop, when the ground is not too rich      in nitrogen, and the barley therefore richer in starch and      not so rich in protein, for it is the starch content that      makes the beer. Barley will grow well on much lighter land      than wheat demands, and in wetter climates. It is much      faster growing than wheat and I have seen barley sown in      May in England give a good crop. You can, in England, grow      winter, barley in the same way as winter wheat; but most      barley is spring-sown: usually in February or March. The      preparation of the land is much the same as for wheat,      except that the tilth should be much finer and the last      ploughing not too deep: four inches is enough. If you drill      it you need two to three bushels to the acre (one to one      and a half hundredweight); if you broadcast it about a      bushel more. Very often you will probably undersow the      barley with 'seeds' (grass and clover seed) for a      subsequent ley. After sowing it must be harrowed of course,      and rolling helps. If the land is very rich in nitrogen a      dressing of phosphate and potash will counterbalance this,      make for earlier ripening, and give a better 'malting      sample'. If the land is poor add to this a hundredweight to      the acre of nitrogen, if you can afford it and have no      ideological objections. But the organic farmer will say to      this: well, the land shouldn't be poor.    </p>    <p>      Harvesting can be just the same as for wheat in every      respect. For a malting sample do not harvest until the      grain is dead ripe the ears all falling over. The      traditional way to harvest fine barley was to cut it with a      scythe and not tie it, but 'make' it like hay. That is rake      it up into swatches, turn it by rake or pitchfork until      both straw and grain are bone dry, then cock it like hay,      cart it to the stack and stack it, and thresh it out in the      winter when there is nothing else to do. I think for the      smallholder this is a very good way of harvesting barley.    </p>    <p>      A word here about the 'barley mow'. There is many a pub up      and down the land of England of that name, and very often      the landlord, even, does not know what it means. In the      wetter parts of the country today, and at one time all over      the country, much corn was put into 'mows' after it had      stood for a week or two drying in the stook. We harvest our      barley and bats in this manner in Pembrokeshire now. As      soon as you get a dry spell, after the corn has been      stooked for long enough to turn the grass that clings to      the roots of the sheaves into hay, you stack the sheaves in      the field in little stacks which are known as 'mows'. You      do it like this: make a circle of sheaves standing upright      and leaning against each other. The diameter of the circle      should be fixed by the length of the sheaves, but after you      have made one mow you will see how big the circle should      be. If the sheaves have been tied by a binder it takes      about fifty of the little sheaves to make the circle. For      stability the outer rings of the circle should lean inwards      (of course). On top, in the middle, lay a ring of sheaves      ears together in the middle and butts outward. Secure each      sheaf to the next by grabbing a handful of its straw and      stuffing it under the string, or band, of its neighbour.      You are left with a ring of sheaves each one tied securely      to the next. Place another ring on top of this one, but      bigger, also secured in the same way. Work, in fact, in a      spiral. Arrange it so that the outer sheaves are lying on a      steep slant because the middle of the heap is much higher      than the outside. The reason for this is of course to shed      the rain. Then continue your spiral upwards, reducing your      diameter until you come to a point. This point will consist      of say five sheaves with their ears blowing up in the air.      The whole mass will be tied together sheaf to sheaf and      completely rainproof, and yet the wind can get through it.      When you have got your corn in the mow you can heave along      sigh of relief, because you need have no further anxiety      about it. You can leave it there nearly until Christmas if      you want to, but probably before the terrible gales of      January and February set in you should have carted it away      to the rick or the barn. The mow is very weatherproof but      not quite gale-proof as the proper corn-rick is.    </p>    <p>      Threshing, winnowing and all the rest of it are the same as      for wheat. For feeding, barley can be ground, in which case      it is unsurpassed pig food, or cattle-fattening food. It      should not be fed to horses as it is too 'heating', and fed      only in moderation to sheep. If you haven't got a mill it      is just as good to soak your barley: dump it in water for      at least twenty-four hours. It then makes a most excellent      stock feed: quite as good as barley meal.    </p>    <h3>      BEER    </h3>    <p>      Barley meal can be baked into bread, and in fact used to be      extensively in the western parts of Britain where barley is      easier to grow than wheat. Never having tasted it I cannot      comment on it, but folk-lore gives it a pretty bad name:    </p>    <p>      I'll eat no more of your barley bread Nor drink no more of      your water, I'll sleep no more in your flea-ridden bed Nor      court your pudding-faced daughter! sang the 'living-in'      farm hand to his parsimonious master. Mixed with wheat      flour it is said to be not so bad. The fact is that the      barley grain differs from the grain of the wheat in that      the protein of barley is soluble in water while that of      wheat (gluten) is not. It is the insoluble gluten of wheat      that makes the dough 'rise': in other words entraps the      carbon dioxide given off by the yeast.    </p>    <p>      But barley has, thank God, one noble use to which it can be      put, and that is the making of beer.    </p>    <h3>      MALTING    </h3>    <p>      Alcohol is made by permitting the yeast organism to feed      upon sugar, whereupon it excretes carbon dioxide and      alcohol. The yeast needs more than just sugar for its life,      just as we, we are told, cannot live by bread alone. Now      the grain of the barley is mostly starch, but before the      barley can grow this starch must be turned by chemicals      called enzymes into sugar. The malster and brewer take the      starch of barley, turn it into sugar, and then 'ferment'      this sugar (as eating it with yeast is called) into      alcohol. The way the malster turns the starch into sugar is      simply by encouraging the grain to grow. This he does by      keeping it wet and warm. When it has grown to the optimum      stage, i.e., when the enzymes have already converted most      of the starch into sugar and are ready to convert the rest      but before the sugar has been turned into plant tissue, he      stops the process of growing by roasting the grain. He then      has a grain that looks very like an ordinary grain of      barley but which is in fact composed more of sugar      (maltose, which is a particular form of sugar) than of      starch. This grain is called malt. He cracks the malt, so      as to make the sugar available.    </p>    <p>      In practice what you do is dump your barley into warm water      and soak it for four days. Drain the water off and keep the      wet grain on a floor at between 63° F to 86° F      (17° C to 30° C), turning it from time to time to      keep it at the right temperature. Turning cools it. Keep it      moist, occasionally sprinkling it with warm water. After      about ten days of this the acrospire as the shoot of the      grain is called (the shoot which intends to grow up into      the air-not the root), should be about two thirds of the      length of the grain. The acrospire grows under the skin of      the grain, but you can see it easily. When this has      happened you must 'kill' the malt, and commercially this is      done in a kiln. With small quantities you can more easily      do it in the oven. If you want to brew a lager or fairly      pale ale keep the temperature of your oven down to under      120° F (about 50° C). When the grain is quite dry,      and brittle between the teeth, raise the temperature a      little for a quarter of an hour but to no more than      140° F (60° C) whatever you do or you will 'kill'      not only the malt but also the subtle enzymes within it      which are going to go on converting more of your starch      into sugar. If you want to brew a dark beer you can roast      the malt until it is brown, but I would advise against      this. If you must have a dark beer burn a bit of sugar and      put it in your beer: it will do no harm if it does no good.    </p>    <p>      If you are malting more than a bushel or two the oven will      be too laborious, and you will need to make a kiln. This      can be quite simply a perforated iron plate (the      perforations being too small to let the grain drop through)      placed over a fire. A coke fire is the best, and the malt      must be turned continuously with a shovel while it is being      kilned. Great care is needed to dry it properly without      overheating it, and there is nothing, for this, to take the      place of Old Mother Common Sense. You must keep looking of      the grain, and biting.. an occasional one, and decide for      yourself when the grain has that brittleness of complete      dryness, and wholeness roasted malty smell of good malt,      and then stop. Of course if you didn't 'kill' the malt it      would go on growing and waste all its sweetness in growth      and be no good at all. Above all kind gently. Never get it      too hot: never above 140° F.    </p>    <p>      In a commercial maltings (which the malting activity of a      large community will more- closely resemble) this is the      sequence:    </p>    <p>      1. Steep the barley for 60 hours or more: up to four days.    </p>    <p>      2. Drain and put on the malting floor in a 'couch'. This is      a high steep-sided heap.    </p>    <p>      3. Leave for 12 hours if it heats quickly-48 if it heats      slowly. The grain should heat to a pleasantly warm      temperature when you shove your hand in.    </p>    <p>      4. As soon as the barley has 'chitted' (that means when the      root has just burst out of the skin) break the couch. That      is shovel the barley out into a flat layer about five      inches deep.    </p>    <p>      5. Now comes the flooring. You must watch the barley      continually to see that it keeps warm enough but does not      get too hot. It heats spontaneously. When it gets too cold      pile it up in a thicker layer. When too licit spread it out      thinner. Use a wooden shovel and wooden rakes and work      barefoot among it so as not to crack the grains. 'Freshen'      occasionally by sprinkling with water. The temperature must      stay between 60° and 62° F (about 16° C).    </p>    <p>      6. After about ten days (i.e., when the acrospire is two      thirds the length of the grain) couch it again for twelve      hours, and hope to get it up to 68° F (20° C). The      rise in temperature is, of course, spontaneous. You now      have 'green malt'.    </p>    <p>      7. Kiln the green malt as described above: not above      140° F.    </p>    <p>      You store your malt in the whole grain form, but before you      use it you must crack it. This you can do with any      mechanical device from a rolling pin to a cracking mill. A      coffee grinder will do. Do not grind it to powder though      just crack it.    </p>    <h3>      MAKING YOUR BEER    </h3>    <p>      This is the principle of the operation:    </p>    <p>      Put your malt into a tun, mash-tub, or kive or whatever      they call it down your way-a big open-topped barrel (many      poor people nowadays have to make do with plastic dustbins)      and mix it into a mash with water that has been boiled and      cooled to about 1 S'0° to 1 55 F (66° to 68°      C). Old people say you can tell the temperature by looking      into your copper-and when the water has cooled enough so      that you can see your face reflected in the water it will      do (but I prefer a thermometer). Mix it up into a thick      mash, such as you might feed to the pigs. Cover it over and      leave it all night. In the morning run the liquor (called      wort in England; spree in Wales) out of the bottom of the      kive, at the same time sparging-that is sprinkling more      boiling water on top of the drying mash. This sparging      water can be boiling-it doesn't matter now. Before it did      matter-boiling water would have killed the enzymes-that's      why you had to be able to see your face in it. Now the      enzymes have done their work.    </p>    <p>      When you have as much wort as you think you ought to have      from the quantity you used of malt (we will deal with this      later) stop sparging and let the mash drain dry.    </p>    <p>      Put your wort back in the copper and boil it together with      as much hops as you think you need wrapped up in a cloth.      You should strain the wort into the copper through a      muslin, for any bits that get in will stick to the bottom      of the copper and be hell to get off, besides tainting the      beer. If you wish to add sugar to give extra strength      (cheating really) now is the time to do it. Boil for an      hour.    </p>    <p>      Put the wort back into your kive (or another vessel if you      have one) for fermentation. Now the faster it cools the      better.    </p>    <p>      In the old days people used to run it into large shallow      pans to cool it quickly. Modern breweries use      refrigeration. We just let it cool by itself, which is all      right in the winter but I think a bit risky in the summer.      It is during this cooling process that the wort may be      attacked by enemy organisms which will beat your yeast and      turn it nasty. I am making, this very day, a copper 'worm':      a spiral of copper tubing which I intend to lower into my      wort and run cold water through, like the 'in-churn      coolers' dairy farmers used to use. But, up to now we have      been brewing for six years and have only had one bad brew.      But still, one is too many: it must be cooled quickly.    </p>    <p>      While the wort is cooling you should be breeding your      yeast. You do this by taking some of the hot wort (a      jug-full), cooling it very quickly by standing it in cold      water; dropping in a handful of yeast, and letting it stand      in the warm. By the time the main body of wort has cooled      to 60° F (or about blood heat-we use common sense not      thermometers) dump your jug-full of breeding yeast in it.    </p>    <p>      To simplify these instructions I will describe exactly what      we do to make from eight to ten gallons of beer.    </p>    <p>      1. In the evening, before we go to bed, we boil ten gallons      of water in a ten-gallon electric copper. We used to use an      oldfashioned copper heated with a stick fire and it was a      darned sight quicker. Now we haven't got one, or we would      use it again.    </p>    <p>      2. While the water is boiling I make a strainer for the      kive. Our kive is a big open-topped tub with a hole in the      side near the bottom in which fits a cock. A cock in this      context is a wooden tap, or spigot. Obviously there has to      be a strainer to let the wort run out of the cock without      letting the mash get in and bung it up. The way we make the      strainer is this. We cut a bunch of gorse, tie a string      round it, put it inside the kive, poke the loose end of the      string through the cock-hole and-holding the string tight      outside-drive the cock in with a mallet. The pressure of      the cock then holds the string tightand the bundle of gorse      against the inner end of the cock. As this straining is      very important I often put a layer of gorse all over the      bottom of the kive and lay a muslin over this also.    </p>    <p>      A better way of doing this straining is not to have a cock      at all, but drill a hole in the middle of the bottom of      your kive. Push a long stick down from the top so that the      end of it goes in this hole and bungs it up. Now, if you      pull the ash stick out you will open the hole. But push the      ash stick in, put a layer of gorse around it on the bottom      of the kive, put a layer of clean straw on top of the      gorse, and lower a big flat stone with a hole in the middle      over the ash stick so that it rests on the straw, and      compresses it, and turns it into a first-class strainer.    </p>    <p>      3. We 'let the water boil, and then let it cool until it is      1 SOO F, or until we can see our face reflected in the      water in the copper. We then mix the water and one bushel      of cracked malt into the kive, making sure that the malt is      thoroughly wet right through.    </p>    <p>      4. We go to bed.    </p>    <p>      5. We get up and start draining the wort as the liquid is      now called into buckets (traditionally the vessel that you      drain into should be wood and is called an underbuck). In      our case we open the cock to do this; in the case of the      ash stick users they loosen the ash stick-and of course the      kive is held up on something so they can get their      underbuck underneath it.    </p>    <p>      6. While this is happening we pour kettle after kettle of      boiling water on top of the malt (this is what is called      sparging). We go on doing this until ten gallons of wort      have drained out. The original ten gallons of water we put      in has been reduced somewhat by natural causes.    </p>    <p>      7. We put the ten gallons of wort in the copper again, put      a pound of hops in a pillowcase, and boil for an hour. If      we    </p>    <p>      wish to cheat and use sugar we stir it in at this      juncture-either six pounds of sugar or, as we always do      nowadays, half a 14 Ib. tin of malt extract, which is      simply maltose, or sugar of malt. Last time I used a whole      tin of malt extract and made 20 gallons of beer with a      bushel and a quarter of malt and the extract.    </p>    <p>      8. We transfer the boiling wort back to the kive which by      now we have cleaned out. Now what we ought to do is to have      another fermenting vat (a plastic dustbin would do) and put      it in this, and then we would be able to make 'small beer'      of the mash in the kive. Not having a spare kive however we      just have to throw the mash out and wash the kive and use      it again.    </p>    <p>      9. We take a jug-full of the wort and cool it by standing      it in cold water.    </p>    <p>      10. When it is blood heat we plop some yeast into      it-generally yeast which we have borrowed from a neighbour      who brewed beer recently. Some neighbour will send a child      to us for yeast in due course, for his beer, and thus the      neighbourhood is knit together, in a friendly mesh of      yeastborrowing, and the strain of living yeast with which      we brew our beer may go back, in ancestry, to the brewers      of Caractacus who knows?    </p>    <p>      11. When the main body of wort has cooled to blood heat we      pour the jug of foaming yeasted wort into it-with a prayer.      We cover it well with blankets to keep vinegar flies out.      The generation of carbon dioxide inside the kive now is      such that, so long as we keep the blankets over it, no      vinegar fly could live.    </p>    <p>      12. Now all we have to do is to keep our hands off it. And      here I might say that in our part of Pembrokeshire the      'Home Brew Belt'we farmers cannot keep our hands off it for      very long. I have known us to be at it like dogs before the      yeast has been in twelve hours. This practice is, of      course, barbarous, and the stuff is far better left alone.      It does not, however, as the uninitiated always suppose it      does, make you ill.    </p>    <p>      We skim the floating yeast off after three days. If you      leave it another day it will sink, which is bad. It is this      floating yeast which our neighbours will send for to make      their beer in due course. Kept cool (many people around      here keep it in a screw-topped bottle in a stream) it will      keep for a month or more.    </p>    <p>      After eight days we rack the beer (pour it) into a      ninegallon barrel, and if we can keep it bunged up for a      month or two it is absolutely superb. If we get eight      gallons from a bushel of malt it is very strong indeed.      Twelve gallons, which many people make, is strong enough.      The stronger it is the better it will keep: eight gallons      to a bushel beer would keep for a year easily. It should      not be golloped down by the pint like pub beer it is far      too good for that. To people not used to it it is      dangerous: in spite of all warnings they are inclined to      drink too much. For such people water it, they won't know      the difference. Water it for the harvest field too, or you      won't get much harvesting done.    </p>    <h3>      SMALL BEER    </h3>    <p>      Now to make ,small beer (which we have never done but will      do) you pour say another ten gallons of boiling. water (yes      you don't have to wait this time until you can see your      face in it) on to the mash after you have taken your first      lot of wort out of it, let it stand until you have finished      boiling your first lot of wort, then run it off and boil it      in the copper like the first wort with hops, put it back      into the cleaned-out kive and ferment it with yeast in the      usual way. It is said to be an excellent nourishing and      slightly alcoholic drink (about the strength of pub beer),      but, like pub beer, it won't keep long. It is good for the      harvest field.    </p>    <p>      The mash, after you have used it, is very good stock food,      and you can feed it to any animals you feel particularly      kindly disposed towards.    </p>        <h3>      VINEGAR    </h3>    <p>      This is beer, cider or wine which has been exposed to air.      It is attacked by Aceto bacter, an organism which converts      alcohol into acetic acid, thus: CZH5.OH+Oz=CH3.COOH+ H2O    </p>    <p>      The traditional way to make malt vinegar is to sprinkle      beer on to the top of a big open funnel which is filled      with birch twigs. The birch twigs have previously been      impregnated with vinegar. The beer runs through the birch      twigs and picks up the Aceto bacter in the presence of air      and turns to vinegar. Strong vinegar contains 6.2 percent      acetic acid and for pickling it must not be less than 5      percent. You will know if it doesn't because, exposed to      the air, it will grow mould on it. It shouldn't. If beer or      wine 'turns sour', turn it to good account by turning it      into vinegar.    </p>    <h3>      DISTILLING    </h3>    <p>      If you fill your copper with beer, float a basin on the      beer, cover the copper with a big shallow dish of either      copper or stainless steel or some clean metal (not      galvanized), allow cold water to pour into the dish and      trickle away over the lip of it, and light a fire under      your copper, you will make moonshine. The alcohol will      evaporate before the water of the beer does, it will      condense on the cold underside of the shallow dish, run      down to the lowest point of the dish, and drip off to be      caught by your floating basin. Distilling is illegal in the      realms of Her Britannic Majesty without a license, which is      very difficult to obtain.    </p>    <p>      A word about gas. If you want your beer to be gassy, like      pub beer, you must keep it in pressure proof containers.      Screwtopped cider bottles are the usual things for this      purpose, and don't blame me if one of them blows up and      kills somebody. Personally I don't like your windy liquids,      and believe that the cult of making gassy beer is      deleterious. Most of the horrible liquid termed 'home      brewed beer' that one has been subjected to by one's city      dwelling friends is of this nature, and generally brewed,      too, from 'malt extract' bought from the chemist. The      makers, nurtured on the windy chemical liquid made by the      giant brewing combines, cannot recognize beer as beer      unless it is bubbling like soda-water, and so they mess      about with their hydrometers, their dollops of sugar, their      screw-topped bottles until they end up with an inferior      imitation of bottled pub beer and it is horrible. Real      beer, such as nurtured the Englishman and the Welshman in      days of old, is a beautiful rich, slightly viscous, bitter,      completely unwindy (yes'flat') liquid, akin to the ambrosia      of the Gods.    </p>
