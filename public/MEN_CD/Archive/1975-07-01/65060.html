        <p class="issue">During the past two years or so an ungodly number of newsletters, tip sheets, weekly and monthly reports devoted to solar energy have sprung up. Most seem to be published out of Washington, are filled with endlessly breathless coverage of what Congress thinks or doesn't think about the sun and ain't worth the paper they're printed on.</p><p>One very pleasant and most noteworthy exception to the above, however, is <strong>SOLAR ENERGY DIGEST</strong> which comes from P.O. Box 17776, San Diego, California 92117.</p><p>SED is edited and published by CW04 William B. Edmondson, Utilities Engineering Officer, USMC Ret., who is director, U.S. Section, International Solar Energy Society, and a member of the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE). Whew! Guys like that, as I'm sure you're aware, sometimes know their stuff but usually have trouble talking to ordinary folks. Not so in this case! Edmondson both knows what's happening (and how to evaluate it) in the field of solar energy and has a knack for putting complicated ideas into layman's language. Besides that, he always zeros in on practical ideas and SED regularly scoops every other solar energy publication on down-to-earth, do-it-now developments in sun powered hardware.</p><p>Â <strong>SOLAR ENERGY DIGEST</strong><br />ain't cheap ($27.50 in the U.S., Canada, and Mexico $33.50 by air to other countries) but it's the best dang monthly newsletter available on the subject. And it's typed and laid out with care, craftsmanship, and love too which we have a hunch that Lillian A. Edmondson (Bill's wife) has something to do, with. If MOTHER had become a newsletter (as we originally planned) instead of a magazine this is about the way it would have looked.</p><p>For a lot of reasons, then, <strong>SOLAR ENERGY DIGEST</strong> has our highest recommendation. If you want the straight skinny on the latest experiments with the sun's power, you can't afford to be without SED.</p>
