        <p>UPS has ordered 200 gasoline-electric hybrid vehicles, the largest commercial order of these trucks by any company, and 300 compressed natural gas vehicles to join their alternative fuel fleet. The 500-vehicle addition will increase UPS’ “green fleet,” already the largest in the United States, by 30 percent from 1,718 to 2,218 low-carbon vehicles. Since 2000, the “green fleet” has traveled approximately 144 million miles in several countries, including the United States, Germany, France, Brazil, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.</p><p>Two hundred hybrids bearing the UPS logo will start traveling the nation in 2009 and are expected to save 176,000 gallons of fuel each year, reducing CO<sub>2</sub> emissions by 1,786 metric tons annually. The 300 natural gas vehicles will be deployed later this year, expecting to yield a 20 percent reduction in CO<sub>2</sub> emissions. UPS has used alternative fuel vehicles for more than 70 years and is continuing to work with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency on a hydraulic hybrid delivery vehicle.
