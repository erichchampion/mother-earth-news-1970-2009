        <p>Composting can be a challenge when you don’t have extra space, but it is still possible to improve your soil organically.</p><p>I start my preparations as soon as the last of my veggies are harvested. I dig a trench about a spade deep and fill it with chopped fruit and vegetable scraps and skins as I collect them. Almost everything that normally would end up in the trash during food preparation can be used. I even chop up citrus skins and banana peels. As soon as one trench is filled, I cover it with soil and dig another one in front of it. This continues right through winter or until the whole future vegetable patch is done.</p><p>By May, the ground is ready to be tilled, and I’m always surprised by the abundance of earthworms who so ably assisted with the breakdown of my compost, while I was hiding indoors from the cold.</p><h5>Cathy Kotzé<br />Nanaimo, Vancouver Island</h5>
