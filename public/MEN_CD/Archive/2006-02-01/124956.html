        Our border collie/German shepherd puppies are great, but theyseemed to dig holes in the same location no matter what we did. Wetried positive reinforcement, scolding, bitter spray deterrents,hot peppers and other methods, but none of them worked ? until wetried this method to stop our dogs from digging holes:<br /><br />Put chicken wire or some sort of steel screen (make sure the holesare not too small) over the favored location; cover the screen withdirt, and wait. Your dogs will try to dig as before, but the wirecovering will stop them from getting too far, and the dogs will bedeterred because the wire hurts their paws. Before long, they willgive up and stop digging holes, then you've solved your problem!
