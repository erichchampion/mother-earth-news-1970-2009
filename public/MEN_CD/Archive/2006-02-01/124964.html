        Knowing how to prevent and treat pest problems is fundamental tomaximizing the rewards you can reap from your gardening efforts.When faced with a pest problem, gardeners ? new ones in particular? often reach for toxic insecticides.<br /><br />It's true that many poisons sold in garden centers will kill any,and often all, insects in your garden. But spraying chemicals israrely the best strategy. Many pesticides are hazardous to humansand wildlife, and most will kill beneficial insects right alongwith the pests you're targeting. Before you march into your gardenarmed for an insect Armageddon, answer three importantquestions:<br /><br /><b>1. Will natural predators control this pest?</b> In many casesthe answer is yes, but you will never see your garden's defenses inaction unless you actively encourage beneficial insects and adopt await-and-see attitude when new pest problems arise. Always watchwhat happens for at least five days after you see a pest becomeactive, before you resort to insecticides.<br /><br /><b>2. Can you control this pest by using preventive methods?</b>You can prevent attacks from many nonflying insects ? as well asdiseases ? by rotating your crops (not planting them in the sameplace more than once every three years); by cleaning up andcomposting dead plants; by eliminating habitats such as weedy hostplants; or by growing resistant varieties.<br /><br /><b>3. Are there easy ways to capture the pest or to installbarriers that will protect the plants?</b> Some insects are easy topick off and drown in a pail of soapy water, or you can nab themwith pieces of duct tape or a rechargeable vacuum. If you see acertain pest returning to your garden year after year, you oftencan protect your plants by covering them with lightweight floatingrow covers.<br /><br />It's important to understand that most garden pests are onlycapable of damaging a narrow range of closely related plants. Forexample, little black flea beetles may make holes in potato leavesin spring, then hop to tomatoes or eggplant in summer, but theywon't veer far from plants that are members of the nightshadefamily. In similar fashion, the squash bugs that invade yourpumpkin patch cannot digest juices sucked from lettuce or broccoli.A few pests do have broad feeding ranges (Japanese beetles eat theleaves and flowers of more than 200 plants, and some grasshopperspecies have equally varied tastes), but for the most part, gardenpests require the presence of specific host plants ? that's whereyou can target your efforts.<br /><br />It's wise to learn as much as you can about the life cycles andphysiques of the pests that are damaging plants in your garden.Invest in a hand-held magnifying glass and a good insectidentification book, such as <i>Garden Insects of North America</i>by Whitney Cranshaw. Also bookmark useful online resources. Twoexcellent places to start are Cornell University's<a href="http://www.nysaes.cornell.edu/pp/resourceguide/" target="_blank">ResourceGuide for Organic Insect and Disease Management</a> and theUniversity of California's<a href="http://www.ipm.ucdavis.edu/" target="_blank">Integrated Pest ManagementProgram</a>. To find local information, begin with the U.S.Department of Agriculture's guide to<a href="http://www.ipmcenters.org/" target="_blank">Regional Integrated PestManagement Centers</a>.<br /><br />The more you know about your problem pests, the better job you cando choosing an intervention that will prevent or stop the damagewithout sabotaging the important work done by beneficiallife-forms.<br /><br />
