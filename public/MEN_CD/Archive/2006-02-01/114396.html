                    <h3>      Life is grand - we have a log cabin, a barnyard full      of animals and 10 forested acres.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Ronnie Stevenson    </h5>    <p>      <strong>S</strong>even years ago, my husband, Tom, and I      were living in Merrill, Wis., with our children, Alyssa and      Casey, when we decided to buy a piece of forested land. At      that time, we were just looking for a place nearby where we      could build a cabin and spend weekends, but we ended up      with a year-round home. We now live on 10 beautiful acres      in a log cabin that we built ourselves. We also keep      animals, including donkeys and chickens. We love living a      quiet life nestled in these huge timbers; the time for      reflection suits us perfectly.    </p>        <p>      We found this place during a long search for just the right      property. To decide if you want to buy a piece of land, you      really have to walk across it, because you never know if      the perfect building spot will be just over the next hill      or on the other side of a swamp. The type of land we were      looking for had to have enough trees to construct a log      cabin.    </p>    <p>      Soon after we finally found and purchased our dream      property, we started building the cabin. It took us two      years to complete it-working mainly on      weekends-and the finished result is about 600 square      feet.    </p>        <p>      Tom had enough building experience to know exactly what      needed to be done to build the cabin. Together, Tom, his      brothers and some of our new neighbors selected and cut      down about 60 aspen trees. Aspen wood starts out fairly      soft, but after it is cut, it dries until it becomes brick      hard. We peeled off the bark using old truck      springs-the stripped trees smelled wonderful! After      the wood had dried for a year, a friend brought over his      portable sawmill and sawed the slabs off the logs on three      sides. We later used some of the slabs to frame the windows      inside the cabin.    </p>    <p>      Tom stacked the cut logs on the perimeter of the      foundation-with a strip of foam insulation between      each one-and drilled a spike down into the other logs      to hold them together. We were able to save money by      collecting used windows and doors for the cabin. Our roof      is metal, which is wonderful when it rains-we can sit      and listen to the patter of the raindrops.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MOVING IN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our decision to live in the cabin year-round came about      three years ago, when Tom had lost his job and we needed to      quickly consider our future plans. Moving into the cabin      seemed like the natural next step, and we feel very      fortunate that everything worked out the way it did. Tom      now works about 45 minutes away, and our son, Casey, goes      to high school in nearby Phillips, Wis. Our daughter,      Alyssa, is in college now and lives in Milwaukee.    </p>    <p>      Our house in town sold quickly, and we rushed to get      electricity installed before we moved into the cabin. I was      excited about the move and so eager to start raising      poultry and livestock that I wanted us to build a barn even      before we installed plumbing.    </p>    <p>      Tom grew up on a farm, but I was born and raised in      Milwaukee and have had to learn all about our new      lifestyle. When we first got our chickens, our city dogs      had no idea what to think. Our little Boston terrier,      Glory, would jump in the chicks’ box and sleep with      them! I think she wanted to be their      mom. I was excited about the chickens, too. Even now, when      I open the chicken coop and see an egg I feel like a child      on Christmas morning. Our rooster is a Barred Rock, with      stunning black and white speckles. His name is Ezekiel, and      he is an excellent alarm clock.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OUR TWO DONKEYS</strong>    </p>    <p>      Shortly after we moved here we acquired a young jenny      (female donkey) named Daisy May, who was one of 60 donkeys      rescued from a neglectful owner. Before we got her,      Daisy’s hooves were curled up from a lack of      trimming. I went to the Phillips public library and picked      up several books about these animals. Donkeys make fierce      “watchdogs,” and many people keep them with a      herd of sheep to scare away coyotes and other predators. To      take advantage of this trait, my husband built the chicken      coop right next to Daisy’s barn, and she helps to      protect our secluded yard from rats, mice and other pests.      We have found numerous dead mice in her stall and even a      dead weasel that she had stomped.    </p>        <p>      A few months after we got Daisy, a neighbor told us we      needed a companion for her, so he gave us one of his      donkeys-a 12-year-old gelding (castrated male) named      Bernard. He moves very slowly, but Bernard is the calmest,      most loving animal I have ever seen. His back is so wide      that when my three nieces ride him they might as well be      sitting on a sofa, and he is so tame that I sometimes catch      one of our cats sitting on his back!    </p>            <p>      It didn’t take long to get Bernard into a harness; he      is so willing to please. Now Bernard takes my nieces for      buggy rides up and down the gravel road. When my mom      visits, she brings Bernard bread and cookies, with the      excuse that it will help maintain his strength.    </p>        <p>      <strong>AN UNEXPECTED EVENT</strong>    </p>    <p>      Donkeys have a long gestation period-12      months-so it wasn’t until about three months      after we got Daisy that we noticed her belly was expanding.      My husband didn’t think Daisy could be pregnant; he      assumed she was eating too much hay. Then one day I was      brushing her and actually saw movement on her side. I put      my hand on her belly and felt the baby give a hard kick!      When my sister came to visit, she felt a kick, too. We may      have grown up in Milwaukee, but we were convinced Daisy was      pregnant, even if my husband and all his brothers who grew      up on the farm said otherwise.    </p>    <p>      One cold November morning, I was feeding Daisy and Bernard      in the back field. I knew something was wrong when Daisy      walked away to the corner of the field, because it was so      unlike her to leave Bernard alone with half a bale of hay.      I ran into the house and called my sister, who had      mentioned she would take off work to witness the blessed      event if Daisy really was pregnant.    </p>    <h3>      Four-legged Friends    </h3>                        <p>      As I was on the phone, I looked outside and saw Daisy lay      down. After grabbing a pair of Casey’s binoculars, I      snuck outside to watch from behind the woodpile. Daisy lay      on the ground straining and pushing. Then she stood up and      started walking around in circles, looking scared. She had      two white hooves hanging out of her, and I realized that if      I didn’t help her, we might lose Daisy and the foal,      too. Once I got Daisy to lie down, I grabbed those two      hooves and pulled hard. I thought I was strong, but I could      not pull that baby out.    </p>    <p>      Finally, it occurred to me to only pull during a      contraction. When I did that, a little white nose appeared,      but the foal’s hooves were hanging limp, and I      thought he was a stillborn. I was devastated, until the      foal made a quiet gurgling sound, proving that he was      alive. I gently slid one of my arms under his neck and my      other arm under his belly to help guide him out. This baby      donkey had fur like lamb’s wool. I laid him on the      ground, and Daisy turned around and started to lick him. I      had just witnessed a baby taking his first breath. Because      of his strength and long hair, I named him Samson.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAKING OURSELVES AT HOME</strong>    </p>    <p>      We have many blessings in our lives. My garden last summer      was another miracle. This was my very first garden, and I      harvested peas, beans, tomatoes and corn. My mom warned me      that I would have problems with the soil, which is heavy      clay, but when the garden took off, she showed up with her      camera and took pictures. For my next garden, I will amend      the soil with manure. With the donkeys and horses around, I      will have to work hard to keep the animals out of the      garden. Last summer, I lost several stalks of corn that      were too close to the fence.    </p>    <p>      I also love horses and now own a Tennessee walking horse to      ride on the trails by our home. I named her      “God’s Sweet Southern Comfort.”    </p>    <p>      This lifestyle brings us true delight. What could be better      than relaxing by a woodstove with a dog snoring on chilly      evenings, or sitting outside and watching the donkeys play      with their football.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Share YOUR Story with Mother      </h3>      <p>        Nobody knows more about the joys and challenges of wiser        living than those of you who are pursuing the dream.
