        <p class="Lore1stparagraph" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">I started law school last summer and thus went from spending 20 to 40 hours per week outside to only 20 to 40 minutes a week. During my between-term break, I needed to catch up on some yardwork. I completely forgot to put sunscreen on the first day and, after about eight hours outside, my lily white skin had turned tomato red.</p><p class="Lore1stparagraph" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"><br />My wife thought I would be in misery, but I remembered a tip from my mom that has been part of our family lore for generations: Use vinegar to season a tan.</p><p class="LoreBody" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">After getting out of the shower, I applied some vinegar (any type works, but apple cider seems to be the best) liberally to all the affected areas. The next morning I had a couple of pink spots left on my face, but everywhere else was tanned as if I had spent a careful week with sunblock. I was in no pain whatsoever.</p><p class="LoreBody" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt">Though I would never recommend forgetting the sunblock, vinegar is an incredible first-aid remedy for dealing with a sunburn.</p><p class="LoreBody" style="MARGIN: 0in 0in 0pt"> </p>
