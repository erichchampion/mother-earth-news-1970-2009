                <p>      Report From Them That's Doin'    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By Bob Kelly    </h5>    <p>      Since the publication of our first "Report From Them That's      Doin' " in MOTHER NO. 22 (pages 56-57), my wife and I have      received an avalanche of mail from folks wanting to know      more about homesteading in northern Minnesota. I'd like now      to answer some of the most commonly asked questions about      this region, and perhaps-in this way-do right      by the many kind souls whose letters we simply haven't had      time to answer.    </p>    <p>      Number One on most people's list of concerns, it seems, is      our climate . . . understandably so, since almost any place      in the continental U.S. is warmer than northern Minnesota!      (When we moved here-in the winter of '73-we      asked an old-timer about the length of the summer season.      His reply was: "Summer? That's the day we play baseball!")    </p>    <p>      Minnesota winters <em>are</em> frigid, make no mistake.      From about mid-December to late February, the nighttime      temperature usually dips below zero (Fahrenheit), and the      mercury rarely goes above freezing during the day. (One      time, about three years ago, we experienced a 16-day period      when the temperature never got above zero degrees!) The      snow, however, is always fresh and dry here during the      winter . . . never the slushy mess that's so common further      south and east. And because dry snow is so much safer to      drive on, the roads in these parts are practically never      salted (which is why you see so many well-preserved old      cars and trucks around).    </p>    <p>      According to the Weather Bureau, this region gets an      average of 21 inches or so of precipitation per year. (You      can figure on an annual snowfall of 45 or 50 inches.) One      thing the weatherman's charts and tables don't tell you,      however, is that-usually-Ole Sol shines bright      on sub-zero days. Personally, I can take a lot of cold as      long as the sun is out.    </p>    <p>      Because we're so far north, our growing season (as one      might expect) is rather brief-90 to 105 frost-free      days per year-but it is long enough to allow a person      to raise sweet corn, early tomatoes, and a slew of      cold-loving crops. (We've even harvested our own vine      pumpkins and Hubbard squash, which are supposed to take 120      days to mature!)    </p>        <p>      About ways of earning a living: The economy here is pretty      much based on the extraction-by mining, logging, and      farming-of natural resources from the land. (The      region is also supported-to a lesser extent-by      tourism.) Jobs in these fields aren't terribly abundant,      but you <em>can</em> land one if you're persistent enough.    </p>    <p>      Probably the most common source of income up here is      small-scale logging. Almost everybody engages in this      activity sometime . . . including us. Carol (my wife) and 1      made about $2,000 as freelance loggers our first year on      the farm, working a total of maybe 50 days. The only      equipment we had was a chain saw and-beyond      that-a horse to skid the cut timber to a landing,      where a hired trucker picked it up. (We spent about five or      six hours a day in the woods, which left plenty of time to      do chores around our place.)    </p>    <p>      Nowadays, I work with three other back-to-the-land types in      a seasonal construction business that has us rolling out to      the Dakotas from late spring through early fall to work      three or four days per week. (We not only earn considerably      more money doing this than we would if we stayed around      Bemidji, the nearest "large" city, but-since we      subcontract our work-we're our own bosses, which      happens to be worth a lot to us.)    </p>    <p>      Carol and I have received a number of inquiries about the      real estate situation here in northern Minnesota. All we      can say-first of all-is that land prices have      soared in recent years (sound familiar?), although our      acreage is still fairly reasonable-$100 or more an      acre for open land, sometimes less for timbered-when      compared to other parts of the country.    </p>    <p>      The main hassle, however, is seldom the price of a piece of      property. Rather, the big problem-more often than      not-is <em>finding</em> a small farm or usable tract      of land that's for sale in the first place! Good-sized,      habitable farmsteads like ours are exactly what hundreds of      people are looking for right now. And usually, when someone      (like me) gets hold of such a place, he isn't interested in      selling for love or money (or both).    </p>    <p>      If you're serious about finding a piece of land here, about      all I can suggest is that you get in touch with one of the      big farm real estate sales firms, such as United Farm,      Safe-Buy, or Strout. Each of these companies is      well-represented in Bagley, Bemidji, Cass Lake, and      Fosston, and will be interested-I'm sure-in      helping you locate what you're looking for. <em>(For more      information, write to the addresses given at the end of      this article.-THE EDITORS.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Many people have written to ask about the feasibility of      "living off the land" here. Happily, such a way of life is      feasible in these parts . . . however, you most certainly      won't be able to make the transition to self-sufficiency      without a fair amount of tools, skills, good judgment, and      money.    </p>    <p>      As I see it, any would-be homesteader must concern himself      with two things if he's to become "self-sufficient": [1]      feeding (and sheltering) himself and his family at as      little cost as possible, and [2] finding a way to earn a      small amount of cash during the year . . . enough to take      care of such things as land taxes and manufactured      necessities. (Like it or not, you will need to buy an      occasional tool, plumbing fixture, light bulb, or other      mass-produced item from the plastic "outside world" now and      then. To think otherwise is nothing but Utopian daydreaming      . . . believe me!)    </p>    <p>      The key to eating inexpensively, of course, is to grow a      large garden. (This is true no matter <em>where</em> you      live.) OK, so you can't raise watermelons and peaches here      . . . you <em>can</em> grow short-season varieties of the      cold-loving crops, such as peas, potatoes, rutabagas,      turnips, cabbage, carrots, beets, and chard (all of which      do well in the 16- to 18-hour days of early summer). A      large freezer-one of those "manufactured necessities"      I spoke of a minute ago-comes in mighty handy for      taking full advantage of the summer harvest . . . however,      a well-planned canning and root cellar storage scheme would      work just as well.    </p>    <p>      Around here, you should have no trouble supplementing your      low-cost garden-grown foods with no-cost wild edibles. Fact      is, I've <em>never seen</em> such a cornucopia of      free-for-the-pickin' nuts and berries as we had in and      around Pinewood (our town) last year! Blueberries,      raspberries, chokeberries, Juneberries, high- and low-bush      cranberries, wild plums, rose hips, and hazel nuts came on      in fast succession throughout the summer, making domestic      planting of these delicacies a waste of time. Add to this      the bounty of Euell Gibbons-type foods (cattails, acorns,      burdock, sumac, etc.) that grow hereabouts, and you've got      a virtual Garden of Eden for foragers!    </p>    <p>      The high-protein end of your diet can be taken care of      inexpensively through fishing and hunting (assuming you      have no qualms about killing for food). Large game      fish-such as walleyed and northern pike-are      legal from mid-May to mid-February, while good-sized pan      fish may be caught in most lakes year round. (An especially      large catch may, of course, be smoked and/or frozen for      later consumption.) Come November, deer season opens . . .      and in case you didn't know, a single kill of venison will      keep you in meat for the entire winter.    </p>    <p>      The nice thing about living this far north is that you can      store meat (venison, for instance) simply by keeping it      outdoors-in a clean, dark locker-throughout the      cold season. (Just be sure to seal the makeshift freezer as      securely as possible, to protect it from cats, dogs,      badgers, and other vermin.)    </p>    <p>      Wild rice grows abundantly in this region and serves as a      kind of double-purpose food for homesteaders, since a      person can either eat the grain or sell it for profit.      Depending on when the crop ripens, the rice season may      begin any time in late August or September. Usually, the      harvesting is done by two people in a canoe: One poles the      craft through the shallow waters of the rice field, while      the other-using a stick of prescribed dimensions (the      entire activity is regulated by the state)-knocks the      ripe kernels of rice into the bottom of the boat.      Experienced ricers can collect as much as 100 pounds of the      grain in a single day this way, which is considerably more      than the average "take".    </p>    <p>      The price paid for wild rice varies. Nearby processors      offer $1.50 to $2.00 per pound for the raw grain. (In      contrast, the same product will fetch $3.50 to $4.00 per      pound in the tourist snares of Bemidji.) Then too, I've      heard that East Coast gourmets pay as much as      <em>$7.00</em> per pound for the delicacy. It's too bad the      producers and consumers can't get together on this one!    </p>    <p>      As I said earlier, a homesteader needs to be able to earn      <em>some</em> money during the year . . . and around here,      we like to take advantage of two handy moneymaking projects      that just naturally go together in the fall: [1] the      cutting of boughs for the Christmas wreath company in      Bemidji, and [2] the gathering of pine cones to sell to      state and private nurserymen.    </p>    <p>      An experienced bough-cutter can gather a pickup load of      trimmings (taken from the bottom branches of young trees)      in a day . . . the equivalent of half a ton, if the truck      has a rack. The boughs then bring $55 per ton in the case      of balsam, or $65 per ton if the cuttings are cedar. (Cedar      pays better because it grows in swamps that're hard to get      into.)    </p>    <p>      Pine cones, on the other hand, are bought and sold by the      bushel. The price paid for them depends on the species of      origin: Jack pine commands around $4.00 per bushel, red and      white pine bring $6.00, and various types of fir fetch up      to $9.00. (It takes quite a while, though, to gather a      bushel of fir cones, which are only one-fourth the size of      the cones from red pine.)    </p>    <p>      If you're thinking seriously of moving to this area, you're      probably interested in knowing something about the local      people. Well, I think I can safely generalize and say that      most northern Minnesotans are good, honest, hardworking      folks . . . people who've managed to preserve (to a      remarkable extent) the pioneer spirit-and the many      all-but-forgotten homestead skills-that their      ancestors brought to this region.    </p>    <p>      Norwegians comprise the largest "ethnic" group here. In      general, they have a reputation for thriftiness that's      amply reflected in their lifestyle. They're uneasy, for      instance, about spending hard-earned dollars for fuel oil,      convenience foods, and packaged entertainment (although      some of them have weaknesses for taverns, polka bands, and      snowmobiles).    </p>    <p>      A good many native residents are older folks who've seen      their own children leave the area to seek the tinsel      treasures of city life, and      who-consequently-are usually happy to see young      people reinhabit abandoned farms and houses ...even if the      youngsters <em>do</em> drive funky vans, have long hair,      and say "far out" a lot.    </p>    <p>      The multiplicity of social institutions that characterized      American life of a century ago still exists, I'm glad to      say, in northern Minnesota. Church and school events are      much discussed and looked for ward to by the local      populace. Homemakers', sportsmen's, and veterans'      organizations thrive. In addition, the local citizens take      an unusually active role in government, since they know      their elected officials as neighbors.    </p>        <p>      Perhaps the two most charming social institutions in these      parts are the <em>cutting bee</em> and the <em>benefit      dance.</em> A cutting bee is an all-out, slam-bang day of      logging in which neighbors work together to raise money for      a family that happens to be down on its luck. Likewise, the      benefit dance is just what the name implies: a dance      designed to generate funds for the relief of people in      need.    </p>    <p>      One of the most unforgettable experiences I've ever had was      when I attended a benefit dance held in behalf of four or      five local families who'd been burned out in a recent      forest fire. The event took place at the Buzzle Town Hall,      a weathered gray, false-fronted relic from the turn of the      century. Inside, sunlight glared on the      corn-flour-sprinkled wood floor, where poker-faced farmers      and loggers pumped away to the polka music with their      strongas-steel womenfolk. Along the sidelines, young      barefoot girls did the twist together as the nasal twang of      the band's lady drummer split the air in a strained      imitation of Loretta Lynn. The vibes were incredibly funky      . . . it was like taking a step back into Steinbeck's      America of the thirties! I remember thinking, "I'm glad      this is my home."    </p>    <p>      If I were to give just one word of advice to folks wanting      to start a new life in the woods of northern Minnesota,      it'd be this: Don't come here and expect the woods and      lakes and wildlife to solve your personal problems by mere      association. (The trouble with our      militaristic/nihilistic/uptight modern society right      now-in my opinion-is that it's brimful of      messed-up <em>individuals . . .</em> individuals      who-unless they take time to sort out their own      private hang-ups-are not going to find happiness in      ANY neck of the woods!) On the other hand, if you harbor no      illusions about country life . . . and you think you can      handle the harsh climate, the scarcity of full-time      employment, and all the rest . . . I say come on out. We'd      love to have you.    </p>    <p>      The following companies have offices all over the country      and publish catalogues several times a year listing farms      for sale.    </p>    <p>      Strout Realty<br />      P.O.
