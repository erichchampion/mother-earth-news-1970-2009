            <p id="issues">      Issue # 99 - May/June 1986    </p>        <h3>      Home Rule    </h3>    <p>      The National Alliance of Homebased Businesswomen (NAHB) has      developed a model zoning ordinance for home businesses. The      model is designed to allow home businesses the same      privileges as other businesses while protecting the      residential character of a neighborhood. Send $2.00 to      NAHB, P.O. Box 306, Midland Park, NJ 07432, for a copy of      the ordinance.    </p>    <h3>      Sans Tube    </h3>    <p>      The Committee on Nationwide Television Audience Measurement      has noted an increase in the percentage of American      households without a television. The number of telly-less      homes increased from 2.9% in 1982 to 4.3% today.    </p>    <h3>      Bad News    </h3>    <p>      According to a recent issue of <em>Science News</em> , an      EPA-funded study indicates that "there is a link between      exposure to poisonous doses of agricultural pesticides      known as organophosphates and a number of      neuropsychological problems, including depression,      irritability, and difficulty in thinking, memory, and      communication." Organophosphates have been widely used for      decades; a particularly toxic oneparathionis thought to be      responsible for half of all pesticide poisonings in the      world today.    </p>    <h3>      More Bad News    </h3>        <p>      Despite the poisonings-of both humans and the      environment-pesticide use is often promoted by aid      agencies and governments of developing countries that      provide chemical subsidies to farmers. A study by the World      Resources Institute has found that hundreds of millions of      dollars are spent annually to subsidize the sale of      pesticides to growers in developing nations. When the cost      of using the dangerous chemicals is heavily discounted,      farmers choose them over more laborintensive, but      environmentally safer, methods of pest control.    </p>    <h3>      Good News    </h3>    <p>      There <em>is</em> an increasing awareness of the harm      caused by environmentally detrimental "aid" to developing      countries. Legislation passed late in 1985 requires U.S.      representatives to the World Bank and three other      development banks to work for environmental reforms in the      banks' lending policies. Science News magazine reports that      the U.S. executive directors of these banks must now      actively promote such practices as "the hiring of more      professionally trained staf to identify potential      ecological impacts of projects up for funding, the      involvement of conservation groups and native-peoples'      organizations in the planning of environmentally sensitive      projects, and more funding of `environmentally beneficial'      projects such as agroforestry, integrated pest management,      and rural solar energy systems."    </p>    <h3>      Quick-cisions    </h3>    <p>      Circumcision Services, Inc. has opened a clinic in Hous ton      for the sole purpose of circumsizing male infants. Special      Delivery (a newsletter of Informed Homebirth, Inc. and      Informed Birth and Parenting, Inc.) reports that the clinic      is advertised in a brochure distributed by the American      College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists in a gift pack      given to new mothers. How interesting. In a 1978 statement      of policy, the ACOG supported the American Academy of      Pediatricians' position that "there is no absolute medical      indication for routine circumcision of the newborn."    </p>    <h3>      Chippewa Ban Lead Shot    </h3>        <p>      The Chippewa have voted to ban the use of lead shot by      tribal members hunting waterfowl during their ofreservation      treaty hunts in northern Wisconsin. Lead pellets lying on      shallow lake and river bottoms are picked up by feeding      ducks, geese, and other waterfowl and cause lead poisoning.      The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service estimates that two to      three million ducks in this country die from the effects of      lead each year. Eagles and other scavenger birds are also      poisoned when they feed on the lead-contaminated waterfowl.    </p>    <p>      Tired of the decades-long debate over the use of lead shot,      the Chippewa have decided to "lead the way in achieving a      nontoxic method for hunting waterfowl." (A detailed article      about this problem, and a comparison of lead and steel      shot, can be found in MOTHER NO. 79.)    </p>    <h3>      Legal Help    </h3>    <p>      The Environmental Task Force has initiated Community      Environmental Legal Services (CELS), a national      publicinterest law firm that will provide free legal      assistance to grass roots groups and concerned citizens. If      you need legal support for an environmental problem in your      community, write to CELS, 1012 14th St. N.W., 15th Floor,      Washington, DC 20005, or call 202/822-6800.    </p>    <h3>      Hive Protection    </h3>        <p>      Some wood preservatives, when used on beehives, decrease      bees' survival rates and contaminate the honey and beeswax.      But scientists with the USDA now consider three      preservatives-copper napthenate, acid copper      chromate, and copper-9-quinolinolate-safe for use on      beehives. Pentachlorophenol (PCP), chromated copper      arsenate (CCA), and tributyl tin oxide (TBTO) are not safe      for hive use. One USDA entomologist says wood preservatives      can extend the useful life of a hive to 20 years or longer,      but he cautions that "all wood preservatives are pesticides      and should be used judiciously."    </p>
