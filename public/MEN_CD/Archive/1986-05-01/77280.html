                    <h3>      Copper Condiment    </h3>        <p>      I read Georgiana Kotarski's trick of cleaning copper with      lemon and salt in issue 97 and just had to write to let you      know what we use: catsup! It's something we almost always      have on hand, and it's kept our Revere Ware looking great      for years.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-E. Noty, Chicago, Illinois</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Where's Mom?    </h3>        <p>      When my children were small, I found that their nap time      was the perfect chance to get chores done around our large      house or out in the garage, garden, etc. However, the kids      were too young to read a note, and I didn't want them to be      alarmed should they wake up and be unable to find me. So I      made a note board for their bedroom door and found pictures      corresponding to the different places around our home. Then      I'd just post a picture of wherever I planned to work while      the children slept. When they woke up, they knew exactly      where to look for me. It always relieved my mind, and I'm      sure it made them feel more secure, as well.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Harla Estle, Hesston,      Kansas</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Flood Facts    </h3>    <p>      I'd like to pass on a valuable bit of wisdom I learned      while inspecting homes damaged by the floods in West      Virginia last year. I saw many houses that floated right      off their foundations and others that were done in by the      pressure of rising and then receding water. But I was      puzzled by one house that had survived while those right      next to it were completely destroyed. Then an old-timer let      me in on the secret to saving a home in a flood: Leave your      doors and windows open. Either nail them open or take them      off to let the water get in and out of the structure      easily. Be especially sure to leave any basement doors or      windows open. I also learned that the best time to clean up      after the flood-if you can do so safely-is while the water      is still in the house. That way you can float most of the      mud and debris out along with the receding      floodwater.-Russ Cockburn, Coeur d'Alene, Idaho    </p>    <h3>      Slick Fix    </h3>        <p>      Ordinary roofing shingles nailed to docks and wooden steps      provide a safe, no-skid surface. They're designed to repel      water, they don't cost much, and nowadays they even come in      a variety of colors.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-P.J. Parziale, Canoga Park,      California</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Don't Tread on Me!    </h3>    <p>      Here's a money-saving idea I found in a 1948 book of      household hints that my grandmother handed down to      me:<br />      Is the carpet runner on your stairs old and worn? You can      make it look practically new by moving the carpet up or      down half a step. That way the unworn riser sections will      now rest on the steps, and the threadbare spots will be      moved to the risers, where they won't show as much.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Helen Puls, Canby, Oregon</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Mormon Tabernacle Dryer    </h3>        <p>      I knew from the awful sound my clothes dryer was making      that it needed some help, but I also knew that I didn't      want to pay for a house call from a repairperson. Since      machines are often diagnosed by sound, I decided to use my      tape recorder and take my ailing appliance's symptoms to      the experts, instead. The man at the store (and his      customers) got quite a kick out of it when I came in and      played the tape recorder for him, but he immediately (and,      I might add, quite accurately) identified just which part      was needed.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Christine Scheere, Greeley,      Colorado</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Eggsorcism    </h3>        <p>      Last year the birds ate every last one of my bean and      cucumber seeds. I wasn't about to offer them seconds, so      when I replanted, I sprinkled the rows with crushed      eggshells. Not only did they keep the birds away (I don't      think the little bandits liked the taste or the texture),      but they also marked the rows nicely.    </p>    <p>      <em><strong>-Diane Graves, Waddington, New      York</strong></em>    </p>    <h3>      Litter Lore    </h3>    <p>      While most MOTHER readers would never dream of throwing      litter out a car window, I'll bet most of us are guilty now      and then of tossing such biodegradables as orange peels and      apples cores. Don't! Free meals attract both wild and      domestic animals to roadsides, and we all know the sad      consequences when automobiles and animals mix.-Leon      Werdinger, Crested Butte, Colorado    </p>    <p>      Through the years we've all probably discovered a few      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems of everyday life.
