                    <p>      <em><strong>A year-round blanket of organic material makes      for an almost labor-free garden.<br /></strong></em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Paul Dennis, Jr.    </h5>        <p>      My affair with mulch began nearly 15 years ago, when I      picked up an intriguing (and now classic) gardening guide      called <em>The Ruth Stout No-Work Garden Book.</em> Talk      about love at first sight! Ever since I was a boy, I'd      enjoyed gardening-but I'd hated hoeing and weeding.      So when I opened the book to the first chapter and read the      title, "Throw Away Your Spade and Hoe," I knew I'd found      something worth trying.    </p>    <p>      For the next several years, I followed my new mentor's      advice, covering the garden with a deep blanket of organic      material to smother weeds, help the soil retain moisture      and virtually eliminate the need to till, plow or hoe.      Vegetables thrived amidst the nurturing mulch, protected      from temperature extremes and fertilized by the decomposing      straw or leaves.    </p>    <p>      But of course no good gardener stops searching for ways to      improve. I became interested in biodynamic/French intensive      (BFI) gardening, which involves growing plants in permanent      raised beds that have been double-dug to a depth of two      feet or more. Because of the deeply loosened,      compost-enriched soil, plants can be spaced closer      together, resulting in dramatically increased yields. I      liked being able to raise more food in less space, but      there was a lot of labor involved in double-digging.      Furthermore, I found making and hauling compost-which      BFI practitioners apply to their beds liberally and      often-to be hard work. Finally, BFI gardeners tend to      shun mulch, preferring instead the "living mulch" created      by the overlapping foliage of closely spaced plants.    </p>    <h3>      Experiment, Adopt, Adapt    </h3>    <p>      If I'd learned anything from experience and from Ruth      Stout's books, it was to <em>ex</em> <em>periment</em>      <em>. . .</em> to try different methods, to be open to the      ideas of others, but always to temper those ideas with      common sense. What works for another gardener may not suit      your particular gardening conditions; sometimes it's      necessary to adapt deep-mulch methods to your own      situation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"Once I've dug and formed a bed, I'll never dig or      till it again."</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Gardening is like cooking: Read the recipe and then use      your head," Stout wrote in her landmark book about      low-labor growing, <em>How to Have a Green Thumb Without an      Aching Back.</em> "A dash of skepticism can do no harm. Go      lightly on caution, heavily on adventure, and see what      comes out. If you make a mistake, what of it? That is one      way to learn, and tomorrow is another day."    </p>    <p>      Applying that principle, over the years I've blended      components of BFI, mulch and conventional gardening      techniques into a system that works for me, and that (here      in USDA Zone 5, at least) seems to allow its various      elements to complement one another. The result is a hybrid:      a no-till, permanent-raised-bed, deep-mulch garden system      that provides several key benefits over other methods I've      tried:    </p>    <p>      Raised beds provide superior drainage in wet weather,      allowing a garden to be deeply mulched without keeping the      soil too wet for too long. Raised beds also help you      produce noticeably larger yields in less space, and      (because you walk only between beds, never on them) they      prevent soil compaction from foot traffic. Deep mulch      virtually eliminates weeding and hoeing, fertilizes plants,      prevents soil compaction (and muddy gardening conditions)      due to rain, creates a fertilizing humus, improves tilth      and encourages a thriving population of worms, beneficial      bacteria and fungi. The combination of dense planting and      deep mulch provides a double layer of mulch-both      living foliage and dead organic material-that      protects the soil far better than either of the two methods      would alone. Because it requires so much less labor, a      mulched garden makes gardening possible and fun even for      small children (kids love to spread mulch) and for senior      citizens and handicapped people. For the same reason, you      can leave a mulched garden for two or three weeks-to      go on vacation, for example-and not come back to a      jungle of weeds. During the busy harvest season, you can      concentrate on picking, preparing and preserving your      vegetables rather than on hoeing and weeding.    </p>    <h3>      Bed Preparation    </h3>        <p>      You don't <em>have</em> to double-dig to make a raised bed;      you can single-dig, plow or rototill the ground. (Keep in      mind, though, that every time you till you destroy worms.)      The important thing is to produce a mound of loosened soil      three to five inches deep and three to four feet wide; the      length and shape of the bed are entirely up to you. You      also have a choice of many methods for holding the soil in      the beds. Some gardeners build borders from planks staked      or nailed into place, while others use landscape ties,      fieldstones, bricks or cement blocks. Most of my beds are      simply heaped earth with the sides sloped at a 45Â°      angle. Mulch prevents the beds from eroding away. (This      method works fine in clay or loam soils but probably      wouldn't be effective in sandy soils.)    </p>    <p>      When I start beds from scratch in sod, I rototill the area      several times over a two- or three-month period to kill the      grasses. (Quack grass, however, is so persistent that I dig      it out by hand; rototilling a single clump chops it into      hundreds of pieces that become hundreds of plants.) Then I      simply heap top-soil from around the bed-in other      words, from the aisles-to form the bed itself. I make      most paths between the beds 15 inches wide, and main aisles      wheelbarrow width.    </p>    <p>      Once I've dug and formed a bed, I'll never dig or till it      again, so at this point I work compost or other amendments      into the area. This is an especially good idea in heavy      clay or sandy soils.    </p>    <h3>      Planting    </h3>    <p>      You plant a raised-bed mulch garden just as you would      <em>any</em> raised-bed garden: Place the seeds close      enough so that, when the plants are mature, their leaves      will overlap to form a continuous canopy. If it's a new,      unmulched bed, sow the seeds as you normally would. Make a      furrow (or hole, or whatever is appropriate) in the ground,      plant the seeds and cover them with soil. Then sprinkle a      little well-rotted mulch or compost on top of the earth to      prevent soil crusting, and place mulch on either side of      the planted area to limit weed growth and compaction from      rain. As the plants grow, tuck mulch around them.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"This is as close to planting the way Nature      does as any method."</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      If the garden is already mulched, it's an easy task to move      the thin (one- to two-inch) layer remaining in spring and      plant. For example, to plant peas I rake the mulch back to      form a one-foot-wide strip of bare earth. Then I plant just      as I do in unmulched beds. With finer seeds such as lettuce      or carrots, I'll rake of an area about four feet square,      sprinkle the seeds directly on the ground and cover them      with a bit of compost or rotted mulch. This is as close to      planting the way Mother Nature does as any method I know.    </p>    <h3>      What Mulch?    </h3>    <p>      You can use newspapers or plastic sheeting as mulch, but      they add little (in the case of newspaper, which decomposes      slowly) or nothing (in the case of plastic) to the soil . .      . and they leave a lot to be desired aesthetically.      Newspapers do work well for mulching aisles, though. I take      care not to use colored newspapers, however (harmful      chemicals can leach into the soil), and I cover the papers      with hay to hide them and to keep them from blowing away.    </p>    <p>      I prefer organic mulches, which not only fertilize the soil      but feed my plow jockeys (worms). Hay and straw are      excellent and long-lasting Grass clippings are good but      decay more quickly. Be careful not to use clippings from      lawns that have been treated with weed killers; traces of      herbicides can be deadly to tomatoes (although, in my      experience, they don't seem to harm fruit trees and some      other garden plants). Bark chips make an attractive mulch.      Leaves are fine, too, but only if they've been shredded or      composted for a year. Freshly raked tree leaves cake      together and smother the soil, retarding plant growth      (raspberries, however, thrive in such material). Finely      chipped tree limbs make a good, enduring mulch (but let the      chips age and soften a year before you try to walk in your      garden barefoot).    </p>    <p>      I've heard people say that sawdust and some other organic      mulches pull the nitrogen out of the soil; as far as I can      tell, this is true only at the surface and doesn't extend      into the earth. I've never noticed such a problem in all my      years of mulching.    </p>    <p>      There are many kinds of other materials you can use for      mulch: corncobs, cocoa shells, rice hulls, etc.      Availability is probably the most important consideration;      the best choice is usually whatever is easiest to find and      least expensive. A good bale of hay can cost $2 or more,      although some farmers will give spoiled hay away. Wood      chips from a nursery can be pricey, but tree trimmers will      sometimes <em>deliver</em> chips to your garden for free.      Just keep an eye out for prospects; you'll be surprised at      how much material is out there.    </p>    <h3>      When to Mulch    </h3>    <p>      <em>Anytime</em> is the right time to start mulching. Here      in Illinois, I keep a comparatively thin (two-inch) layer      of mulch on my garden most of the year, because in this      climate a thicker mulch during cool seasons would chill      heat-loving plants. Sometimes I rake the mulch off a vacant      bed in order to plant, or to let the soil warm up for a few      weeks before planting (though my thin mulch seldom retards      soil warm-up significantly). I don't mulch my garden deeply      until the weather gets hot and dry. Then I really pile it      on: up to eight inches if I can. Obviously, with short      plants such as lettuce this is difficult, but with      potatoes, broccoli and other tall cultivars it's easy to      do, and the plants love it.    </p>    <p>      I also adjust my mulching to suit the particular plant. For      example, broccoli prefers cool soil, so I pile mulch on my      broccoli beds early in the season. Tomatoes like it hot, so      I don't mulch them heavily until summer starts to hit      hard-usually June but sometimes as late as July. Of      course, I also throw mulch on any spots where the layer is      thinning out, or where weeds start popping up.    </p>    <p>      As the season progresses into fall and the weather cools, I      no longer need to add mulch-which is convenient,      since I need the time for harvesting and preserving my      garden's bounty. If I notice a patch of bare soil, I'll put      a little mulch on it, and if a bed seems particularly wet,      I might pull a little of the material off.    </p>    <p>      By the following spring the mulch, having settled and      decomposed, is no more than a couple of inches thick, but      that's enough to prevent soil gusting and to discourage      early weeds. There's no need to till or plow      mulchconditioned soil, so I don't have to wait several      weeks-as most gardeners do-for the garden to      dry enough to tolerate tines or a plow blade. I plant peas,      lettuce and other cool-loving crops as soon as the ground      thaws in the weak sunlight of early spring.    </p>    <h3>      The Great Moderator    </h3>    <p>      There is no single right depth for mulch, no more than      there is a single best material to use or a perfect time to      use it. You can add mulch or take it away, apply a thin      layer or heap it on thick. More than just a way for lazy      gardeners to avoid tilling and weeding, mulch is a great      moderator-you can use it to adjust soil moisture and      temperature, to protect against frost and drought, to      create just the right conditions for a particular type of      vegetable or flower.    </p>    <p>      If you try some of my mulching techniques (or Ruth Stout's,      or anyone's) and they don't quite work, don't dismiss the      method altogether. Instead, see if you can find out how to      change the way you use mulch to suit your own situation.      For example, if mulch seems to keep your soil too moist for      too long, perhaps you're applying too much too early. If      you garden in sandy soil, a conventional flat row garden      may be a better idea than raised beds. If insects become a      problem in your mulched garden, the <em>kind</em> of mulch      you're using could be to blame-or (even more likely)      perhaps the cause is entirely unrelated to mulch.      <em>[Editor's Note: Some type of mulch are used to</em>      fight <em>pests. A deep mulch of leaves, straw or hay      discourages potato and cucumber beetles; sharp sand repels      slugs.]</em>    </p>    <p>      I think the advantages of using mulch-not the least      of which are less labor, a longer season, more control over      soil conditions and a garden that improves year after      year-are well worth a little trial and error.    </p>    <h3>      RECOMMENDED READING    </h3>    <p>      <strong>Books by Ruth Stout:</strong> <em><br />      The Ruth Stout No-Work Garden Book</em> (Rodale, $9.95).      <em><br />      Gardening Without Work</em> (Cornerstone, $1.95).<br />      <em>How to Have a Green Thumb Without an Aching Back</em>      (Exposition, $7.50).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Other Useful Books:<br /></strong> <em>No-Dig,      No-Weed Gardening</em> by Raymond Poincelot (Rodale,      $10.95). <em><br />      Jeff Ball's 60-Minute Garden</em> by Jeff' Ball (Rodale,      $9.95).    </p>
