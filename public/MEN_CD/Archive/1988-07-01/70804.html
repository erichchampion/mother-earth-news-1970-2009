            		<p>      <strong>Country Lore</strong>    </p>    		<p>        A compendium of successful strategies.    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">      by Lorna Loveless    </h5>        <p>      Have drugs, AIDS, the nuclear threat, crime and the      troubled economy stopped jockeying for position as the      primary threat to the American way of life? You might think      so, judging from the content of much of MOTHER'S recent      mail. And what's the major menace confronting our readers?      Ants.    </p>    <p>      We must admit this flood of mail on a single subject was      prompted by a "Dear Mother" letter published in issue 107,      in which Sandy Hawley of Marshall, Texas, asked for      help-suggestions on how to control an invasion of      ants; a method that <em>didn't</em> involve the use of      harmful chemicals. Readers rushed to Sandy's aid with an      array of artillery.    </p>    <p>      To chase ants from inside the house, lots of folks employ      vinegar. Used full strength, it can be wiped on counter      tops, shelves, base cabinet floors and thresholds-any      surface the ants traverse that can't be harmed by the      acidic liquid. Or put vinegar into a spray container and      spritz wherever ants are likely to hide. If the soil      outdoors is dry, you can spray the stuff around entrances      to the interior.    </p>    <p>      Cinnamon sticks placed four feet apart around the perimeter      of the house, both indoors and out, as well as sprinklings      of ground cinnamon in cracks, have kept ants from a      Canadian reader's house for 14 years. Cinnamon is a popular      repellent, but so is pepper. There must be quite a turnover      on grocery shelves of cayenne pepper, because our mail      indicates that it's used extensively on ant invaders. Just      dust it along their paths, and they'll soon opt for a      detour. One reader grows an extra supply of <em>Capsicum      frutescens</em> for this very purpose; she minces the dried      peppers and challenges the ants to their own version of      walking on hot coals. Then again, the proponents of ground      black pepper feel it's every bit as powerful as the red.    </p>    <p>      Cucumber peelings are another favorite. They're thought to      be toxic to ants, and one user said that by regularly      replacing the slivers of peel as they dried up, her house      was cleared of ants in a week.    </p>    <p>      Several formulas were also recommended. Foolproof and      nontoxic is the claim for this one: Mix 1/4 cup of sugar,      1/2 cup of sorghum molasses and 1 package dry yeast.      Portion this into jar lids, and place them where ants have      been spotted. Another is to combine 4 ounces of boric acid,      1/2 cup of flour, 1 tablespoon of sugar, 1/8 cup of      shortening and enough water to make a paste. Roll bits of      this dough into pinhead-sized balls, and place them where      ants travel. But don't use this if you have small children      or pets.    </p>    <p>      Instead of chasing ants away, one ingenious soul draws them      near. He drops a few spoonfuls of honey into a small      plastic bag and leaves it on the floor overnight. There are      dozens of prisoners to dispose of (he doesn't say how) in      the morning. After about six days of this, the ants know      when they've been outwitted, and they depart for good.    </p>    <p>      One last suggestion for indoor intruders is to shake      powdered cleanser on the trails. After the ants have gone      (and they will go), the cleanser is easily wiped or      vacuumed up. This took care of hundreds of the little pests      for one homeowner, who also used it on the patio to foil an      army of carpenter ants.    </p>    <p>      Outdoors, those expanding hills aquiver with determined      troops are, as they say, "a whole nother" problem. Quite a      few Southern readers swear by grits. They suggest pouring a      cup or two on the ground near the anthill. Evidently the      hungry soldiers succumb to indigestion and bloating. One of      our grits theorists thinks the queen ant becomes too      constipated to lay eggs. Regardless of why this attack      succeeds, a 10-acre Florida homestead was proclaimed      "basically ant-free" after just a few assaults.    </p>    <p>      One politic reader says to find two anthills, dig a      scoopful of ants from each one, and then exchange them,      placing each battalion in an enemy camp. This evidently      starts a war, and the ants eliminate each other.    </p>    <p>      Here is a much more benign conclusion reached by a      thoughtful landowner. "Some 10 years ago, I purchased 42      acres of forest, in which many of the trees were      antinfested. I felt that to preserve the woods, I had to      eliminate the ants. I was only 'doing my part.' Since then      I've learned that Mother Nature has her own set of checks      and balances. Who are we to question her placement of the      ant? She assembles all the necessary elements to create the      delicate ecosystems covering the earth. Now I leave it to      her to let the ants control themselves as long as they are      not extreme annoyances. Today the same trees are still      infested, but there are lots of brand-new trees growing      strong and healthy to take their places. You can see how      I've eliminated my ant problem. I've merely changed my      mind."    </p>    <p>      For myself, I prefer this last approach if at all possible.      I also prefer to believe a story told about Albert      Schweitzer. It seems his house in the African jungle was      absolutely overrun with ants, as it had inadvertently been      built straddling a main route of the insects' interstate.      The benevolent doctor squatted down and addressed the ants:      "Now look here," he said. "I'm drawing a chalk line across      the floor from one side of the house to the other. I      respect your perseverance, your industriousness, your team      spirit. But this is my home, not yours. However, realizing      you need to get from here to there, you may use the house      as a thruway if you march right along this line and don't      wander."    </p>    <p>      The ants seemed to accept his proposition, and they and he      coexisted without further confrontation.    </p>
