                    <p>      <em>Barbara Heller shows how to turn a tried and true      staple into six mouthwaterin' meals.</em>    </p>		<hr />        <p>      It's hard to find a more healthful-or less      expensive-food than soybeans. These "miracle" legumes      are not only low in starch, but high in protein, vitamins,      minerals, and lecithin.    </p>    <p>      And here are some cosmopolitan recipes that have all been      kitchen-tested (by three hungry men) and rated excellent!      However, before you attempt anything fancy, you should      first know how to prepare the beans for use.    </p>    <h3>      THE BASIC RECIPE    </h3>    <p>      Soak a pound of soybeans in enough water to cover 'em by      two inches. (These beans will nearly triple in size, so use      a big pot.) After the soybeans have soaked for a day, skim      the film that will have formed, add a teaspoon of salt (and      more water, if necessary), and bring the pot to a boil.      Then, reduce the heat and let the beans simmer until      they're tender (usually about 2-1/2 to 3 hours). Skim the      foam from time to time, and don't let the pot boil over: A      floor full of beans is a real chore to clean up!    </p>    <p>      (I usually cook one or two pounds of soybeans a week, leave      half of them whole, and grind up the rest. This single      cooking gives me the basis for a week's meals with a      minimum of work. I also save and store the leftover,      nutritious cooking water for later use in soups, breads,      and so forth.)    </p>    <p>      Cooked beans can-when put through a food      grinder-be substituted for (or added to) ground meat      in almost any recipe. (Just be sure you don't get them too      tender, or they'll form a paste when you try to grind 'em.)      All of the following dishes call for already "prepared"      soybeans, so start soaking your beans the day before you      plan to serve the meal.    </p>    <h3>      CHILI CON SOYBEANS    </h3>    <p>      Sauté 1 chopped onion, 2 cloves of finely minced      garlic, and 1 chopped green pepper-in 2 tablespoons      of safflower oil-until the onions are golden. Add 3      cups of cooked and ground soybeans, 2 cups of tomato      purée or canned tomatoes, 1 tablespoon of chili      powder, 2 teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of paprika, and 1      teaspoon of sweet basil or oregano . . . then let the pot      stand covered (but <em>not</em> over heat) while the      flavors blend. Later-about half an hour before      serving time-heat the mixture to a boil and let it      simmer. (You can add more chili at this time if you like      really hot food.) The spicy dish is great served over brown      rice or in tacos, and a little grated      cheese-sprinkled on top of your chili-will make      it especially delicious.    </p>    <h3>      SOY-RICE-BEAN LOAF    </h3>    <p>      Combine 1-1/2 cups of prepared ground soybeans, 1-1/2 cups      of ground, cooked black beans, 1 cup of cooked brown (or      wild) rice, 1 grated onion, 1/2 cup of tomato sauce, 1-1/2      teaspoons of salt, 1 teaspoon of dry mustard, 1/2 teaspoon      of garlic powder, and 1 teaspoon of paprika. Put about a      third of this mix into a greased loaf pan, top it with 3      sliced, hard-boiled eggs, and then pack in the remainder of      the mixture.    </p>    <p>      Finally, cover the loaf with a combination of 1/4 cup of      catsup, 2 tablespoons of mustard, 2 tablespoons of brown      sugar, and 1 tablespoon of molasses . . . and bake it for      an hour at 350°F.    </p>    <p>      (You can also shape the loaf mix into patties and broil or      fry 'em to a golden brown. These "burgers" should be      sprinkled with grated cheese-or wrapped around a      piece of cheese-before they're cooked.)    </p>    <h3>      SOYBEAN MOUSSAKA    </h3>    <p>      Sauté 1 chopped onion and 1 minced clove of      garlic-in 2 tablespoons of safflower oil-until      the pieces turn golden. Add 3 cups of "basic recipe" ground      soybeans, stir to separate any lumps, and then brown      slightly. When the beans are ready, mix in 1-1/2 cups of      tomato sauce, 1/4 cup of dry white wine or sherry, 1/2      teaspoon of paprika, and 1 teaspoon of salt ... and let the      pan simmer for 10 minutes. Meanwhile, cut 1 medium eggplant      into 1/4"-thick slices, dip each piece in flour, and      sauté 'em in hot oil until they're lightly browned      on both sides. Drain the slices on absorbent paper.    </p>    <p>      While the eggplant drains, grease a 2-1/2-quart casserole      dish and line the bottom with 1/8 cup of wheat germ. Then,      place alternate layers of eggplant and soybean mixture in      the dish, and top it with 2 sliced tomatoes.    </p>    <p>      For the finishing touch, mix 1 cup of yogurt, 2 egg yolks,      2 tablespoons of melted butter, and 1/4 cup of flour in a      separate bowl. Pour this mixture over the tomato slices,      sprinkle on another 1/8 cup of wheat germ, and bake the      moussaka in a 350° F oven for 45 minutes.    </p>    <h3>      SOYBEAN SUKIYAKI    </h3>    <p>      Cook 1 cup of sliced onions in hot oil until golden. Add 1      cup of sliced celery, 1/2 cup of sliced water chestnuts,      and 1 cup of sliced mushrooms . . . and sauté      <em>these</em> ingredients for 2 minutes more. After that's      done, stir in 1 cup of prepared (whole) soybeans and 1 cup      of sliced green scallions.    </p>    <p>      Then, in a separate bowl, combine 1 cup of soy sauce, 1/2      cup of broth (beef, chicken, or vegetable), 1/4 cup of dry      sherry or sake (optional), 3 tablespoons of brown sugar,      and 1/4 teaspoon of pepper. Pour this mixture into the pan,      cook it for 5 minutes (uncovered), and serve the sukiyaki      with rice or thin noodles. (You can use your imagination to      vary the vegetables in this recipe. For instance, why not      substitute bamboo shoots, green or red peppers, green      beans, or thinly sliced carrots for the water chestnuts,      mushrooms, or scallions? Each change will produce a      distinctive-and delicious-dish.)    </p>    <h3>      SOYBEAN LASAGNA    </h3>    <p>      Sauté 1 large chopped onion and 1 clove of minced      garlic. Transfer these ingredients to a big saucepan and      stir in 1 large can of tomatoes (use the liquid, too!) and      1 can of tomato paste. Fry some mushrooms (these are      optional, so the amount is up to you) and add 'em to the      pan, too. Then, lightly brown 2 cups of ground soybeans and      mix <em>them</em> in. Bring the ingredients to a boil,      reduce the heat, and let 'em simmer (covered) for 1 hour.      (While the sauce cooks, add salt and pepper to taste.)    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, cook and drain 1 pound of lasagna noodles. Pour      some of the sauce into the bottom of a 9" X 13" baking pan,      and add alternate layers of noodles, grated Parmesan cheese      (1-1/2 cups, total), sauce, sliced mozzarella cheese (1-1/2      cups, all told) and dabs of ricotta cheese (about 1-1/2      pounds in all). Repeat the layers until your ingredients      are used up, and top the lasagna with sauce and grated      cheese. This Italian delight should be baked in a 350°F      oven for 15 minutes...or until it's firm.    </p>    <h3>      SOYBEAN CURRY    </h3>    <p>      Cook 1 cup of green peas, 1 cup of sliced carrots, 1 cup of      peeled and diced potatoes, and 1 cup of string beans (cut      into inch-long pieces) together in enough salted water to      cover everything. When the vegetables are tender-but      still crisp-set the pan aside <em>without</em>      draining the liquid from it.    </p>    <p>      Then-in a separate pot-heat 4 tablespoons of      safflower oil and add 1-1/2 tablespoons of curry powder (or      make your own curry seasoning with 1 teaspoon of cumin      seed, 1 teaspoon of salt, 2 teaspoons of mustard seed, 2      teaspoons of turmeric powder, 1 teaspoon of coriander, and      3/4 teaspoon of cayenne pepper). Blend the oil and spices      well and add the vegetables, cooking liquid, and 1-1/2 cups      of prepared soybeans. Then bring the pot to a boil and mix      in 1/2 cup of yogurt. Simmer, stirring occasionally, for 15      minutes. Add more water if a thinner curry is desired, and      use more or less cayenne pepper to vary the dish's      Spiciness. (The turmeric gives curry its yellow hue, so be      sure to wipe up any spills right away . . . because this      spice will color a table or counter, too!)    </p>    <p>      Serve the finished curry with rice and chutney ... it's an      inexpensive meal that's fit for a maharajah!    </p>
