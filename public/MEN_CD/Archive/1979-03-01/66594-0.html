        ABOVE, LEFT: the cables on James and Sammie Damer-on's Satsop River bridge are anchored in the ground by cedar logs buried four feet deep (the lines on the other side of the river are set in concrete). Treated posts hold the cables?and the bridge?high... well above the unpredictable torrent that ruined the Dameron's first fiver spanner. ABOVE: U-shaped steel rod hangers?salvaged for free from old silos and bent to shape by a neighborhood black-smith?hang from the bridge's ""suspenders"" and under-prop the middle and ends of each 16-foot creosoted board. Jim plans to close in the sides with wire fencing... after he and his wife finish their do-it-yourself country home!
