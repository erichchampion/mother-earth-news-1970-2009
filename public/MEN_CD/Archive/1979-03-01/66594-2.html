        BOTTOM:The river's low now, but even during floodtime the Dameron water-spanner stays high... and dry. This angled view shows the short posts on the high side of the river. To make the bridge level, the posts on the low side had to be a good bit taller. In fact, those ""lower bank"" poles stand nearly 11 feet off the ground
