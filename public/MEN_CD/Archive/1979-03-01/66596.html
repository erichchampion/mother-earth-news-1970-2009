                    <p>      <strong>PART I</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Veterinarian Randy Kidd is back ... with more on how to      keep your pets and barnyard animals<br />      healthy.</em>    </p>        <p>      It's very possible that a number of total strangers are      thriving on the food that you give to your livestock or      pets. These "freeloaders" may take many forms, but they      usually resemble white worms and could be either several      feet in length or microscopically small.    </p>    <p>      I'm talking, of course, about internal parasites,      and-if your feed bills have been rising while the      general health and productivity of your animals have been      slipping-these pests are probably already well      established around your farm or home.    </p>    <p>      Internal parasites (commonly called worms) occur in every      part of the world . . . and each living creature (yes, even      humans) has its own particular worms. Worse yet, since      these parasites live (usually) in an animal's belly or      intestines, you may not even know that your beasts are      infested with 'em! Of course, animals with severe worm      problems will display some of the classic symptoms-such as      weight loss, poor growth, low milk yields, weakness, or      white gums-but a critter <em>can</em> have parasites      without showing such drastic signs. For example, a recent      experiment-conducted on healthy- <em>looking</em>      goats-showed that milk production was increased by      17% after one dose of an effective worm medicine!    </p>    <h3>      THE PROBLEM WITH PARASITES    </h3>    <p>      Before you can even begin a parasite elimination program,      though, you'll have to realize that you are faced with more      than one form of pest. You see, most worms have several      stages in their life cycles . . . and-in order to      completely eradicate the freeloaders-you have to      attack each of those Individual stages separately.    </p>    <p>      In order to explain this difficulty, let's look at the life      cycle of the common parasite, <em>Haemonchus</em> . The      adult worm thrives in the stomachs of sheep and goats, and      there, in its hiding place, the parasite lays tough-skinned      eggs . . . which are passed In the host animal's feces      (manure). Now, these eggs can lie on your fields for years      (unaffected, in many cases, by either freezing cold or      intense heat), just waiting for another animal to come      along and pick them up.    </p>    <p>      So, the first problem that confronts the "do it yourself"      parasite controller is that worm eggs can be almost      anywhere and are nearly impossible to destroy.    </p>    <p>      But, let's continue with our "sample" parasite. The eggs in      that sheep or goat manure may, perhaps, be picked up by a      small snail who happens to be munching grass in the area.      Once inside the snail (which is referred to as the      parasite's "intermediate host"), the egg will develop into      a larva . . . this is the second stage in the life cycle of      the <em>Haemonchus</em> .    </p>    <p>      The snail, however, crawls merrily around and hardly      notices the presence of the worm larva. Then along comes      your friendly lamb or kid-who isn't a particularly      fussy eater-and he or she munches on the tasty grass      and inadvertently swallows the tiny snail.<br />      <br />      Now that the larva is back in the kind of critter that      makes it happiest (in this example the sheep or goat is the      final or '' definitive'' host), it will do one of several      things. For instance, the larval worm may move into the      animal's stomach, develop into an adult parasite, and begin      passing more eggs onto your pasture. Or, for some unknown      reason, the larva might decide to take a detour on the way      to its host's stomach. This "side trip" is called larval      migration, and-since it could take the pest through      muscles, blood vessels, lungs, or liver-can be more      harmful to your animal than the adult worm would be. (This      is, of course, not a particularly appealing or appetizing      picture of the worm's life cycle, but internal parasites      aren't particularly appealing or appetizing creatures.)    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, the parasite larva may find the      environment inside your critter not to its liking. When      this happens, the larva will form a cocoonlike substance      around itself (this is called "encysting") and can-in      this form-lie dormant until a change in the internal      environment causes it to emerge. Unfortunately, the      environmental changes that make life easier for the      encysted larva can further compound your parasite problems.      When your ewe or doe gets pregnant-for      example-its internal environment may change enough to      cause the parasite to emerge from its cyst and begin      another migration. If this happens, the traveling larva      might find its way directly into the unborn offspring or      into the mother's milk . . . which explains why many      animals are infested with parasites at birth.    </p>    <p>      This example should convince you that worms are pretty      difficult to eliminate. You could, for instance, try to get      rid of all the eggs . . . but-unless you're capable      of (and interested in) picking up every little, black sheep      or goat nugget in your pasture-this will be a nearly      impossible task.    </p>    <p>      Or, of course, you can try to kill the adult parasites by      giving your beast the proper medication . . . but the      medicine that will destroy the adults will, usually, not      kill the larvae. Because of this, you must administer worm      medicine at least twice (once to destroy the adults and      once to kill the larvae <em>after</em> they've become      adults), and it's better still to administer wormers      periodically throughout the host critter's lifetime.    </p>    <h3>      SOME GENERAL RECOMMENDATIONS    </h3>    <p>      There is, however, no need to throw your hands up in      despair. Because there are many things that you      <em>can</em> do to ease your animals' parasite problems . .      . and fortunately, a number of these preventive measures      are easy enough for anyone to undertake.    </p>    <p>      In the case of the sheep and goat parasite, for instance,      there are several simple courses of action that could help      break the egg-larva-adult life cycle.    </p>    <p>      You could, perhaps, allow your animals to use a large      pasture rather than cramping them together in a small pen.      This would insure that the critters had less exposure to      their own manure and would also lessen the chance that any      wandering snails (or other intermediate hosts) would pick      up parasite eggs. Also, if the pasture is thick and lush,      your beasts are less likely to gulp down one of those      snails . . . because the little shelled critters like to      stay hidden in moist places <em>beneath</em> the grass      cover.    </p>    <p>      And, of course, you'll want to keep your animals' "living      quarters"-whether these are in the barn or      shed-scrupulously clean. Daily manure removal is a      must with most farm beasts . . . and don't forget that the      manure is "organic gold" for your compost pile. Remember,      too, that many worm eggs won't attain their effective stage      until after they've matured on the ground for a few days,      so-by consistently removing the animal      droppings-you can actually break the parasite's life      cycle! (The rule around the Kidd house is: "If a stall      isn't clean enough to sit down in, it's time to get the      pitchfork out." This attitude has helped us keep our      worm-and rusty pitchfork-problems to a      minimum!)    </p>    <p>      If you have two or more pasture areas, it's wise to rotate      your grazing livestock so the animals will only be pastured      on a particular piece of land every two (or, better yet,      three) years. This pasture rotation gives Mother Nature a      chance to help you eliminate your parasites ... by either      covering the eggs with dirt or killing them-over a      period of time-with sun and frost. Also, the majority      of the snails, etc. that might have ingested a larva will      have disappeared after a span of a year or two.    </p>    <p>      As you can see, simple good husbandry can go a long way      toward breaking the life cycles of most parasites. And you      have another ally in your fight against worms, too . . .      the natural resistance to parasites that your animals can      develop. A beast's ability to resist parasitic infestation      <em>can</em> be compared to your ability to "throw off" a      cold. While you'll likely never completely avoid colds,      your body may-as you grow older-become less and      less susceptible to these minor illnesses. So it is, too,      with animals and their parasites ... as the beast matures,      it becomes at least partially resistant to some worms.    </p>    <p>      But-just as our resistance to the common cold can be      lowered if we become "run down" or exposed to unhealthy      environmental conditions-a weary, unsheltered, or      poorly fed animal will be much less likely to develop an      immunity to parasites.    </p>    <h3>      DO YOUR ANIMALS HAVE PARASITES?    </h3>    <p>      At this point you're probably scratching your head and      wondering if your beasts might, indeed, have parasites.      Unfortunately, there's no way for you to tell by looking at      the animals. A dog who eats grass may have worms . . . but      then again, he or she might just like eating grass. A goat      who chews on the manger may carry parasites, too, or      perhaps be simply bored. Unless animals are heavily      infested, they won't likely show the classic "symptoms".      The beasts may just not be as "vital" as they would be if      they were completely healthy.    </p>    <p>      Most worms that could infect your pets or barnyard beasts      are far too tiny to be detected with the naked eye. The      tapeworm, however, is the exception to this rule. If you      notice small, white, worm-like things crawling around in      fresh manure (or small, white, dried-up objects that      resemble rice grains) chances are that your critter has      tapeworms. The "ricey" looking objects are actually      segments, or proglottids, of what may be a very long      parasite . . . and each of these sections is a "packet"      that contains many tapeworm eggs.    </p>    <p>      The only way to discover whether or not your critters have      the smaller worms, though (or to tell which <em>kinds</em>      of worms they're harboring), is to have your vet check the      animals out. To do this, the veterinarian will mix a sample      of the beasts' manure in a solution . . . and the manure      will sink while the parasite eggs float to the top. By      examining these eggs under a microscope, the vet will be      able to tell what kinds of worms are present and can then      determine the best methods to control the pests. (Having a      fecal sample analyzed for parasite eggs shouldn't run you      more than a few dollars . . . and unchecked worms could      cost you more than that in no time!)    </p>    <p>      All you have to do to prepare for one of these tests is      collect a sample of fresh manure-a lump about half      the size of a horse chestnut will do-and whisk it off      to your vet. You will, of course, need a separate example      for each kind of animal that you have, but-if you      keep a number of one kind of critter in one      area-you'll only need a single sampling ... as all of      the sheep, cows, etc. In that pasture or barn will probably      be hosting the same parasites.    </p>    <p>      Remember that the samples (you can carry 'cm in an old baby      food jar or the like if your vet doesn't provide a      container) should be fresh. If the manure sits for too      long, the eggs may hatch into larvae . . . and these won't      necessarily be found by a vet who's looking for eggs.      Tapeworm segments won't show up in a flotation test, either      . . . but, of course, you'll be able to spot those worm      "indicators" yourself.    </p>    <p>      If, for some reason, you have to wait a day or two between      the time that you collect the samples and your trip to the      vet, put the manure (safely sealed in its jar, of course)      in the refrigerator. When kept cool in this way, the      samples will be "good" indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      Once you and your vet have determined what kind of      parasites (if any) your animals have, you can decide what      sort of worm medicine will most effectively eliminate the      pests.    </p>    <h3>      WORM MEDICINES (ANTHELMINTICS)    </h3>    <p>      There are several things to consider before you choose the      kind of wormer (these medicines are called anthelmintics .      . . anti = against, helmins = worm) you want to use.    </p>    <p>      The anthelmintic that you select (with your veterinarian's      help) should, of course, kill the particular worms that      your critter has . . . and shouldn't be harmful to the host      animal. Piperazine, for example, is an anthelmintic that is      used in a number of worm preparations, and it's an      extremely safe medication for almost all critters. However,      while piperazine is effective against round-worms, it will      kill few-if any-hook-worms, tapeworms, or      whipworms.    </p>    <p>      So, ideally, the medication that you administer should be      highly effective against <em>many</em> kinds of worms.      Several recent anthelmintics have been developed that can      destroy a variety of parasites, and some of 'em will kill      nearly all of the worms that are commonly found in      critters. These medicines are the broad-spectrum      anthelmintics.    </p>    <p>      And, since these broad-spectrum anthelmintics allow you to      use one medication for almost all of your parasite problems      (some of 'em even destroy migrating parasitic larvae!),      they can really simplify a do-it-yourself worm elimination      program.    </p>    <p>      Finally, the anthelmintic you choose should be both      economical and easy to administer. Most of the newer worm      medications come either in powder or granular forms (which      can be sprinkled on feed) or in a paste or liquid (that can      be squirted directly into the animal's mouth).    </p>    <p>      Remember, though, that any anthelmintic should be      administered in the prescribed manner . . . and in many      cases wormers should be used at a particular time of year.      Anthelmintics for bots (a horse parasite), for example,      should-in most parts of the U.S.-be given at      least once after the first frost. There also seems to be a      seasonal increase in the release of parasite eggs ... so      your control program had best include a treatment that      correlates with this stepped-up egg "production".    </p>    <p>      And, of course, there are certain specific precautions that      should be taken when using anthelmintics.

Box 70, Hendersonville,      North Carolina 28739.)<br />    </p>    <p>      Caution No. 1: <em>Know what you're doing!</em> Before      using an anthelmintic (or any type of medication), read the      directions on the label . . . and then reread them until      you understand everything that they recommend!    </p>    <p>      Caution No. 2: <em>Use the correct dosage</em> .      Anthelmintics are meant to eliminate parasites without      harming the host animal. Overdoses of wormers can make an      animal sick, or even kill the beast. Do <em>not</em> assume      that a double dose of worm medicine will be twice as      effective as the recommended quantity . . . overdosing is      an often fatal mistake.    </p>    <p>      And, since many of these medicines are administered      according to the "patient's" weight, be sure that you      <em>know</em> how much your critter weighs or that you at      least have a knowledgeable person do the estimating for      you. (Sale barns or county fairs are good places to learn      weight estimation . . . since the animals are all weighed      before the sale or show.)    </p>    <p>      Caution No. 3: <em>Be extremely careful when using      anthelmintics on sick animals, young animals, pregnant      animals, or lactating animals (critters giving milk)</em> .      It is always potentially dangerous to give <em>any</em>      medicine to a sick animal, and anthelmintics are no      exception to the rule. The same warning applies to young      beasts, too, and some worm remedies should <em>never</em>      be used until a critter reaches a prescribed age.    </p>    <p>      Pregnant animals should only be medicated under a vet's      supervision. Some of the older wormers acted by increasing      the muscle activity of the intestines . . . in order to      shake the worms loose and flush them out. This kind of      medication could also cause muscular activity in the uterus      (or womb) . . . and result in an aborted offspring.    </p>    <p>      Finally, almost all medicines given to a milking animal      will be passed into the milk,      and-again-anthelmintics will follow this      pattern. Of course, the quantity of medication that is      passed into the milk-and the length of time during      which it will show up-varies from one drug to      another.    </p>    <p>      Dairy farmers refer to the time period during which a      medicine can be detected in milk as the "withdrawal time"      for that medication. No milk should be used for human      consumption during this withdrawal time . . . although some      of it may be safe for animal use. There is also evidence      that several wormers will cause a milking cow or goat to      dry up (quit producing milk).<br />      When you're in doubt about using a particular anthelmintic      on any sick, young, pregnant, or lactating animal, always      consult your vet <em>before</em> administering the      medication.    </p>    <h3>      IN CONCLUSION...    </h3>    <p>      If you've been listening closely up to this point, you're      probably anxious to begin your own worm elimination      program. So, let's take a look at Dr. Kidd's Famous Five      Point Parasite Control Course (well . . . maybe      <em>someday</em> it'll be famous).    </p>    <p>      POINT 1: <em>There is a wealth of wisdom in keeping your      critters healthy</em> . Give your animals all of the aid      you can in their battles against internal parasites. This      help should include a wholesome diet, a fresh water supply,      clean and adequate shelter and bedding, and-once in a      while-a little bit of affection to keep the critters      content. A healthy, happy animal is much more likely to be      able to develop its own resistance to internal parasites.    </p>    <p>      POINT 2: <em>Graze your grass graciously</em> . If      possible, rotate your animals annually to a completely      fresh pasture (that is, a piece of land that hasn't had      beasts on it for at least a year). A three-year pasture      rotation, of course, would be even better. (Remember, too,      that adequate pasture space helps avoid dense accumulations      of potentially egg-bearing manure.)    </p>    <p>      POINT 3: <em>Manage your manure</em> . Animals that are      confined in pens, sheds, stalls, or kennels should have      their manure removed daily. In addition, the barnyard or      feedlot should be cleaned periodically.    </p>    <p>      <em>(No parasite control program is complete UNTIL you      practice-religiously-these first three      points!)</em>    </p>    <p>      POINT 4: <em>Pickle those parasites with the proper      parasiticide</em> . Identify the parasites that are      infecting your animals, and then attack the squirmy      villains with the best ammunition that you have . . .      consistent and routine use of an effective anthelmintic.    </p>    <p>      POINT 5: <em>Analyse your efforts</em> . Always have your      vet run fecal checks <em>at least</em> once a year. These      tests should be performed at a time two to three months      after you last administered worm medication. Since the      maximum effectiveness of most anthelmintics only lasts for      60 to 80 days, this delay will allow your animals to show      signs of any <em>new</em> parasites the critters might have      picked up in your pasture.    </p>    <p>      You may never be able to completely eliminate parasites      from your animals, but don't let this fact discourage you .      . . the main aim of parasite control is to keep the levels      of infestation as low as possible.    </p>    <p>      Of course, the alternative to parasite control is-in      most cases-letting the worms take over. If you allow      this to happen, you could end up feeding more food to your      parasites than you do to your pets or barnyard animals!    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Dr. Kidd will return in our next      issue-MOTHER NO. 57-to discuss specific      parasites and the anthelmintics that can best be used to      control them.</em>    </p>
