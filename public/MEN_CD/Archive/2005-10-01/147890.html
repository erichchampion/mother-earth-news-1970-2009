        <p>Slowly, a new kind of fast-food restaurant business is gaining popularity in the United States. In April, a small chain in the Northeast called O’Naturals opened its fourth store - in Somerville, Mass., a Boston suburb.</p><p>The franchise, which opened its first restaurant in 2001, is the brainchild of Gary Hirschberg, the president and CEO of Stonyfield Farm organic yogurt company. Naturally, granola and yogurt is a staple of the restaurant’s menu. O’Naturals also offers free-range chicken flatbread sandwiches, bison meatloaf, organic smoked tofu, all-natural chicken nuggets and organic cheesecakes.</p><p>“Simultaneously people are living these crazy lifestyles and looking for alternatives,” O’Naturals president Mac McCabe says. “O’Naturals is a marriage between the search for something organic with the lifestyle people lead.”</p><p>The restaurant, McCabe says, is marketed toward families who are already paying a premium for better quality food. The price range of the restaurant reflects that - most items cost between $4.75 and $7.</p><p>But the key to making O’Naturals competitive with other fast-food franchises, McCabe says, is having a delicious product.</p><p>“Whether it’s natural or organic - it doesn’t matter, as long as it tastes good,” he says. “So we’re giving great food, and by the way, you get this bonus that there’s no garbage in it.”</p><p>O’Naturals is not alone in the effort to “slow down” the U.S. fast-food industry. In Colorado, Good Times burger chain offers all-natural beef; Florida’s EVOS chain offers tacos with free-range and hormone-free meats. Chipotle - a subsidiary of McDonald’s - serves meals with local ingredients and natural pork products.</p><p>Visit the <a href="http://www.onaturals.com/" target="_blank">O’Naturals Web site</a> for a list of the restaurant’s locations.</p>
