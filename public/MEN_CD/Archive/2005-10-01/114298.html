                    <h5 id="byline">      By Walter C. Willett, M.D.    </h5>    <h3>      Choosing a plant-rich diet is one of the most      important-and enjoyable- ways to stay healthy.    </h3>    <p>      <strong>T</strong>he phrase “Eat your vegetables,      they’re good for you” springs out of the      parent’s mouth unbidden, like wisdom that must be      passed from generation to generation. That’s actually      pretty accurate. “Eat plenty of fruits and      vegetables” is timeless advice that science is only      now catching up to.    </p>        <p>      A diet rich in fruits and vegetables can decrease the      chances of having a heart attack or stroke; lower blood      pressure; help you avoid constipation; guard against two      common aging-related eye diseases?-? cataracts and      macular degeneration; help you feel full with fewer      calories; add variety to your diet and enliven your palate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Potatoes Don’t Count</strong>    </p>    <p>      To a botanist, a fruit is any plant part that contains      seeds. In this article, I will stick with the culinary      concept of fruits as sweet dessertlike foods, and      vegetables as savory salad- or dinner-type foods. I am not      including potatoes in the vegetable category, even though      they are the most popular vegetable in America. Like rice      and pasta, potatoes are made up mostly of easily digested      starch. Studies show that eating potatoes isn’t      linked with the same health benefits as is eating other      vegetables and fruits.    </p>    <p>      Back in 1991, the National Cancer Institute launched its      5-a-Day public health campaign, urging us to eat five      servings of fruits and vegetables a day. This campaign has      been incorporated into the government’s Dietary      Guidelines for Americans. Five a day is a good start, but      it gives no real guidance on what qualifies. Two glasses of      orange juice, an apple, an order of french fries at lunch      and potatoes with dinner meets the 5-a-Day target. While      that’s better than no fruits and vegetables at all,      it doesn’t offer the full dose of health benefits      described here. Use five a day as a minimum, not a goal.      Don’t include potatoes in your daily tally, and try      to vary the fruits and vegetables in your diet.    </p>    <p>      While any one fruit or vegetable contains dozens, maybe      hundreds, of different compounds that your body uses for      something besides energy, no single fruit or vegetable      contains all the substances you need. It’s a good      idea to eat for color variety as well. Painting your diet      with the bold colors of ripe red tomatoes, crisp orange      carrots, creamy yellow squash, emerald-green spinach, juicy      blueberries, indigo plums, violet eggplants and all shades      in between not only makes meals more appealing, but also      ensures that you get a variety of beneficial nutrients.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Many Health Benefits</strong>    </p>    <p>      Prevent heart disease. A diet that includes plenty of      fruits and vegetables can help control or even prevent two      of the main precursors of heart disease and stroke: high      blood pressure and high cholesterol. Even better, investing      in a plant-rich diet pays off in terms of lowering your      chances of developing several forms of heart disease and      stroke.    </p>    <p>      By combining the results of 17 large, long-term studies,      researchers estimated that people in the top tier of fruit      and vegetable consumption (about 35 servings a week or your      basic five a day) are 15 percent less likely to have a      heart attack or other problem caused by restricted blood      flow to the heart muscle than those in the bottom tier.      Among more than 100,000 men and women participating in the      Harvard School of Public Health’s Nurses’      Health Study and the Health Professionals Follow-up Study,      we found that eating about 30 servings of fruits and      vegetables a week (or just under five a day) was associated      with a 30-percent lower risk of the most common type of      stroke (ischemic stroke), the kind caused by a blood clot      blocking an artery in, or to, the brain. We calculated that      eating one extra serving of fruits or vegetables a day      decreases the chances of having an ischemic stroke by about      6 percent. In this study, most of the benefit seemed to      come from eating broccoli, spinach, kale, romaine lettuce,      and citrus fruit or juice.    </p>    <p>      Keep your eyes healthy. This goes way beyond the admonition      to eat carrots for better vision (actually better night      vision). A number of studies now show that people who      regularly eat dark-green leafy vegetables such as spinach      and collard greens are less likely to develop two common      aging-related eye diseases?-?cataracts and macular      degeneration. In both diseases, free radicals are believed      to be responsible for causing much of the damage. Free      radicals are highly reactive substances generated inside      the eye by bright sunlight, cigarette smoke, air pollution      and infection. Dark-green leafy vegetables contain two      pigments, lutein and zeaxanthin, that accumulate in the      eye. These two can snuff out free radicals before they can      harm the eye’s sensitive tissues    </p>    <p>      Avoid bowel trouble. Fiber sops up water like a sponge and      expands as it moves through the digestive system. By      triggering regular bowel movements, fiber can relieve or      prevent constipation. The bulking and softening actions of      fiber also decrease pressure inside the intestinal tract      and so may help prevent diverticulosis (the development of      tiny, easily irritated pouches inside the colon) and      diverticulitis (the often painful inflammation of these      pouches).    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cancer-fighting Foods?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Twenty-five years ago, two eminent epidemiologists      estimated that “dietary factors” accounted for      35 percent of cancer deaths in the United States, or      roughly the same amount as were chalked up to smoking at      the time. While 35 percent may be overly optimistic, the      basic message that better diets?-?heavy on the plant      foods, please?-?help guard against a variety of      cancers is perfectly sound.    </p>    <p>      So far, more than 200 studies have looked at the connection      between diets high (or low) in fruits and vegetables and      the development of cancer. Initially, they estimated a      50-percent reduction in most major cancers if everyone got      at least five servings of fruits and vegetables a day. That      was the basis of the National Cancer Institute’s      ongoing 5-a-Day program.    </p>    <p>      Most of the early studies were case- control studies. In a      nutshell, these involve comparing differences in diet,      habits and other possible causes of cancer between a group      of people with a particular cancer and a group without it.      Such comparisons aren’t always fair or without bias.      People with cancer, for example, tend to seek reasons for      why they were stricken and may be more apt to find fault      with their diets than those without the disease. The      consistency of results from case-controlled studies created      a deceptively strong idea that eating plenty of fruits and      vegetables helped ward off cancer.    </p>    <p>      Cohort studies, in which information on diet and other      lifestyle factors are collected before cancer, heart      disease and other conditions occur, tend to give more      reliable and durable results. Not long ago, our team at the      Harvard School of Public Health combined information on      fruit and vegetable consumption and cancer from our two      large cohort studies after the 110,000 participants had      been followed for almost 20 years. During this time, 9,100      had developed some type of cancer. Those who averaged eight      or more servings of fruits and vegetables a day developed      cancer at about the same rate as those who ate fewer than      one-and-a-half servings a day.    </p>    <p>      Does this mean that eating fruits and vegetables has no      impact whatsoever on cancer risk? No. Although they      don’t have a blanket anti-cancer effect, fruits and      vegetables may work against specific cancers. The      International Agency for Research on Cancer commissioned an      exhaustive review of the hundreds of case-control and      cohort studies that have looked at fruit and vegetable      consumption and cancer over the years. Drill down a bit      into the data and there’s some evidence that certain      types of fruits or vegetables work against specific      cancers. Examples include the following:    </p>    <p>      • Eating cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli has      been linked to lower rates of bladder cancer.    </p>    <p>      • There is strong evidence that the vitamin folic acid      helps protect against colon and rectal cancer. Vegetables      such as spinach and beets are good sources of folic acid.    </p>    <p>      • Lycopene from tomatoes and cooked or processed      tomato products such as tomato sauces or ketchup seems to      be helpful in the prevention of prostate cancer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Putting it into Practice</strong>    </p>    <p>      There isn’t any magic daily number or combination of      fruits and vegetables for optimal health. Instead, I offer      two words of advice: more and different.    </p>    <p>      Aim high. Use five servings a day as a minimum goal and      shoot for more.    </p>    <p>      Eat for variety and for color. On most days, try to get at      least one serving from each of the following fruit and      vegetable categories:    </p>    <p>      • dark-green, leafy vegetables.    </p>    <p>      • yellow or orange fruits and vegetables.    </p>    <p>      • red fruits and vegetables.    </p>    <p>      • legumes (beans) and peas.    </p>    <p>      • citrus fruits.    </p>    <p>      Cook your tomatoes. Treat yourself to tomatoes, processed      tomatoes or tomato products cooked in oil on most days.      Tomatoes are rich in lycopene, a powerful antioxidant that      has been linked with lower rates of a variety of cancers.      Because lycopene is tightly bound inside cell walls, your      body has a hard time extracting it from raw tomatoes.      Cooking breaks down cell walls, and oil dissolves lycopene      and helps shuttle it into the bloodstream.    </p>    <p>      Fresh is better. Eat several servings of fresh, uncooked      fruits and vegetables each week because cooking damages or      destroys some important nutrients. Vitamin C and folic      acid, for example, are sensitive to heat. Truly fresh      fruits and vegetables add enormously to the pleasure of      eating a healthy diet. The freshest produce is what you      grow yourself and pick just before you eat it.?    </p>        <hr />    <p>      Walter C.
