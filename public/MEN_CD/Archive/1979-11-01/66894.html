                <p>      Williard Olney offers MOTHER'S readers...    </p>        <hr />    <p>      My "good idea" batting average over the past 60-odd years      is well under 500, but I want to take this opportunity to      share one of my brainstorms. I've found a way to cure colds      or flu ... and it works so well that I <em>haven't had      either of those illnesses since 1963.</em>    </p>    <p>      However, let me qualify that somewhat shocking statement      with an explanation: I've caught my share of cold and      influenza infections in the past 16 years, but I've always      been able to stop the attacks at the first-day stage and be      back on my feet the following day.    </p>    <p>      I suppose I should also-at this pointadd a disclaimer      to get me off-any lurking legal hooks. Therefore:      <em>What</em> follows <em>is an account of what I have done      and continue to do, in the belief that it stops my colds      and</em> flu <em>... but my story is not to be taken as      medical advice. OK?</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE BATTLE BEGINS    </h3>    <p>      What happens when you're invaded by those viral organisms      that cause colds and flu? First, you become aware that all      is not right with your body. Perhaps your joints begin to      ache a bit, and you may sneeze and feel chilly. (My own      "cold test" is to roll my eyes far to one side ... if it      hurts a little, I know the aches and other symptoms will      soon follow,)    </p>    <p>      In earlier times you might have been given lemon juice and      honey ... or any number of other remedies, most of which      did no good whatever.    </p>    <p>      Nowadays-if you're like most folksyou ingest enough      aspirin to keep your temperature down (and the drug      companies' profits up).    </p>    <p>      Finally, If you become sick enough or run out of aspirin,      you'll develop a fever, And, after that, you'll probably      gradually improve to a semblance of your normal state of      health ... ready to battle the next attack when it comes.    </p>    <h3>      THE LIGHT DAWNS    </h3>    <p>      Sometime during 1963 1 read a magazine article describing      the life cycle of the viruses which cause colds and flu. I      learned that a virus attaches itself to a red blood cell,      squirts itself inside, and uses the cell's "machinery" to      make about 200 duplicates of itself ... each of which      sallies forth-in search of another cell-to      repeat the cycle. This reproductive process only takes      about 30 minutes.    </p>    <p>      It's the speed of this viral duplication that gives us      symptoms so quickly, because-despite the rapid rate      at which our marrow and liver constantly pour new red cells      into the blood-the virus destroys cells faster than      our bodies can produce them. With the lowering of the      number of red cells, oxygen transport is impaired, and we      begin to notice the muscular aches and pains that typically      accompany the flu.    </p>    <p>      The magazine article went on to      mention-offhandedly- that when blood      temperature is elevated a few degrees, the viruses cease      their activity.    </p>    <p>      "That sounds like a fever to me!" I ex. claimed ... and I      remembered that many of the bouts with colds and flu that      I'd had <em>did</em> seem to "cure themselves" soon after a      fever. It seemed to follow that, if I gave myself a fever      <em>before</em> becoming sick enough to get one naturally,      I could stop the destruction of my red cells and,      therefore, cure the illness!    </p>    <h3>      A HOT PRACTICE    </h3>    <p>      I don't remember how long I had to wait before a cold      caught up with me so I could test my idea, but-when I      tried the "heat treatment" out- it worked ... and      it's worked for me <em>every time</em> since then,    </p>    <p>      In the evening of any day when the first hint of "the bug"      shows up, I inch my way into as hot a tub of water as I can      stand and stay there until my temperature gets up to      102°F. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: For safety's sake, the bath      water should be no hotter than 105°F, and one should      not remain in it for longer than 20 minutes.]</em>    </p>    <p>      It's very difficult to force myself to stay in the hot      water, but I've learned that a drink (that's when lemonade      and honey come in handy ... try taking the beverage hot,      too, if you can stand it) is a great help. Sip and steam,      steam and sip.    </p>    <p>      Oh, yes! <em>While</em> I'm bathing, my wife piles an extra      blanket or two on the bed. Once I'm "up to temperature", I      dry off, slide into the sack, and <em>sweat.</em>    </p>    <p>      My wife stays well to her side of the bed, while I doze,      sweat, and keep my temperature high for about four hours.      Gradually, through the night, I reduce the number of      blankets so that, by morning, I'm dry and-behold!      -I feel great. Of course, I don't go out to climb      mountains right away, and I make sure to keep warm for a      day or so ... but I have no sickness.    </p>    <p>      So there you have it. The "cure" makes sense to me,      and-with hand over heart-I assure you that I      haven't had more than first-day symptoms since I      started taking my hot bath treatments.    </p>    <p>      One last word about safety: Because -when a person is      immersed in hot water-less blood is available to bring      oxygen to the brain and dizziness can occur, I always ask      my wife to give me a hand as I step out of the tub. And, of      course, such "tender loving care" does its share to ease      the symptoms of the cold, too!    </p>
