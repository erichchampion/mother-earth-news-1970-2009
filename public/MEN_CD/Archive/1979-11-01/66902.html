            		 <p>      <em>This loaf is as delicious and nutritious as it is      elevated!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by ALDEN STAHR    </h5>      <p>      I baked my first loaf of whole-grain bread over 30 years      ago-and I've tried a passel of recipes in the decades      that have followed-but I've never been able to make a      batch that'd rise more than half an inch above the pans...      even when I used one packet of yeast for each and every      two-pound loaf!    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, my friend Eva Knausenberger uses only      three yeast packs to bake the equivalent of 10 two-pound      loaves... and her bread always rises to delicious heights!    </p>    <p>      Naturally, I demanded her secret recipe. Eva, however, is a      "dump cook"- using a "little" of this, and a "certain      amount" of that-as her ingredients vary with supply      and with her baking-day whims. She agreed to let me watch      her bake, though, and-as the accompanying photos      show-I was able to record just how Eva turns out her      beautiful batches of bread. Here's the procedure:    </p>    <p>      [1] Soak 12 cups of mixed grains (rice, millet, wheat,      barley, groated oats, rye, buckwheat, and triticale in      equal amounts) overnight... then macerate them in a      blender.    </p>    <p>      [2] Use a flour mill to grind up 8 pounds of whole wheat, 1      pound of triticale, and 1/2 pound of rye into flour... and      hand-mix these ingredients with the blended grains.    </p>    <p>      [3] Add 1/2 cup of olive, safflower, or corn oil... 1 cup      of unsulfured molasses... 4 to 6 eggs... 3/4 cup of corn      flour... 1 cup of buttermilk powder (sometimes sour      cream)... and 3 packets of dry yeast (soaked-until it      "proofs"-in a little of the grain water) to the grain      and flour mixture.    </p>    <p>      [4] Knead the dough vigorously-by hand-for 15      minutes, or until the dough is very stiff... cover it with      a moist towel... let it stand at room temperature for two      hours... then knead the bread-to-be thoroughly again.    </p>    <p>      [5] Finally, separate the dough into loaves and bake in a      350°F oven for approximately two hours (the second rise      takes place in the oven).    </p>    <p>      [6] You probably won't be able to wait the recommended 24      hours of "curing time" before you sample your huge      loaves... because they're as tummy-titillating as the aroma      promises: Eight-grain bread is definitely a treat to      taste... and a healthful one, as well!    </p>
