                <p>      <em>Even if the winter snow is chin-deep to a short      giraffe, you can grow delectable snackinâ€™ or salad      greens on your windowsill!</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by BONNIE MANDOE</h5>        <p>      As far as <em>my</em> tastebuds are concerned, sprouted      sunflowers are about the most delicious germinated seeds      available ... and I've tried nearly all of the common      sprout varieties including alfalfa, lentil, radish,      fenugreek, garbanzo, wheat, soy, mung, azuka, red clover,      cress, and chia.    </p>    <p>      Also-while many of us do know that sunflower seeds      are nutritionally potent little packages-few people      realize that the tasty kernels are almost 25% protein ...      contain vitamins A, D, E, and the B complex ... provide      incredible amounts of potassium ... and are high in      calcium, magnesium, and iron. And, of course-since      germination activates a plant's stored energy-the      sprouts have <em>fewer</em> calories, yet <em>more</em> of      all these vitamins and minerals than do the dry seeds!    </p>    <p>      However, unlike most sprouts (which can be grown in a      simple screen-topped jar), baby sunflowers are germinated      upon soil. An old drawer-with small holes drilled in      the bottom for drainage-makes an ideal sprout box ...      or, if you prefer, you can simply construct a flat out of      scrap lumber. (In either case, the depth of the growing      container need not exceed three inches.) Then, cover the      drainage holes with pebbles ... fill the box-to a      depth of about two inches-with garden soil... and      place it in a sunny location (a heated greenhouse would, of      course, serve this purpose perfectly, but a good      "southerly" window can provide all the light you'll need).      Next-in order to have 2-1/2 square feet of these      crisp and tender morsels ready for the table in seven to      ten days-follow this procedure:    </p>    <p>      [1] Soak 4 cups of <em>unhulled</em> sunflower seeds for 8      to 12 hours ... scatter them one layer thick ... and press      'em down (firmly) on the soil with your hands.    </p>    <p>      [2] Sprinkle the box with water and cover it with      newspaper.    </p>    <p>      [3] Water the seeds- <em>through</em> the      newspaper-once a day until the growing sprouts start      pushing the paper up ... which should take two to four      days, depending on the temperature. Then remove the      newsprint and continue to give the seedlings a drink daily,      picking the seed hulls off the leaves only after the small      plants begin to stand up.    </p>    <p>      [4] Reap your harvest with scissors when the first two      leaves open ... rinse ... shake dry... and-if you      don't eat 'em all in one sitting-store the excess in      the refrigerator.    </p>    <p>      [5] <em>Voila!</em> You're ready for some delicious,      nutritious, "garden"-fresh treats.    </p>
