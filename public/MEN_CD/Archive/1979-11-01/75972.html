                            <p>      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their writing and research-gave special meaning to      the words "population", "resources", and "environment" in      the late 1960's. (They also coined the term coevolution,      and did a lot to make ecology the household word it is      today.) But while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs'      popular writing in the areas of ecology and overpopulation      (most of us-for instance-have read Paul's</em>      book The Population Bomb)... <em>far too few people have      any idea of how deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in      ecological research (research of the type that tends to be      published only in technical journals and college      textbooks). That's why it pleases us to be able to      present-on a regular basis-the following      semi-technical column by authors/ecologists/educators Anne      and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE "MIGRATION MENACE‚Äù    </h3>    <p>      Over the past decade, the vast majority of Americans have      become aware that population growth is no longer a      blessing. In fact, most people seem to have accepted the      conclusion-reached by the U.S. Commission on      Population Growth and the American Future-that the      nation has nothing to gain from an increase in the number      of its inhabitants. One sign of the acceptance of this fact      can be seen in the dramatic change in this nation's      childbearing habits... as completed family size      dropped-between 1960 and the early 1970's-from      about three children per couple to approximately two      children.    </p>    <p>      A great many citizens rightly view the modification of our      national reproductive habits as an investment in the      future, and see themselves as exchanging the pleasures of a      larger family for the knowledge that the few children they      do have will stand a <em>better</em> chance for a      high-quality life. If the typical family's size remains      close to what it is now, births and deaths will be balanced      by around 2020... and natural population increase will end.    </p>    <h3>      A NEW THREAT?    </h3>    <p>      But population growth can also be caused by migration.      Therefore, It's not surprising that-since the      mid-1970's- there has been an increase in public      concern about the pattern of immigration to the United      States... and especially about the numbers of immigrants      coming into this country from Mexico. People have begun to      receive the impression (advanced by the media) that we're      about to be swamped by a brown-skinned horde from      south-of-the-border... that these illegal immigrants are      taking jobs from Americans and worsening our employment      problem... that illegals are draining our welfare system...      that their children are filling up schools supported by      taxpayers' money... and that Mexican workers are sending      huge amounts of money back to their homeland, affecting      America's balance of payments.<br />      <br />      All of these notions can be traced in large part to the      statements of General Leonard F. Chapman, Jr.-who      served as Commissioner of the Immigration and      Naturalization Service (INS) during the mid-70's-to      the effect that there were some eight million Illegal      immigrants already in the United States, and that thousands      more were entering every day. According to a 1975 INS press      release, "Studies done for the INS indicate illegal aliens      cost taxpayers $13 billion or more annually...."      Superficially-with over 800,000 illegals apprehended      in 1975 alone (the vast majority of them from      Mexico)-the concern seems justified, and people like      Professor Garrett Hardin of the University of California,      Santa Barbara-who realize that this country is      already over-populated-see in this illegal flow the      potential undoing of the good that's been accomplished by      the dramatic plunge in the American birthrate.    </p>    <p>      Since we, too, are concerned with the problem of      overpopulation, we began to study the migration from Mexico      about two years ago. Working with Professor Loy Bilderback      (of the Department of History, California State University      at Fresno), we interviewed illegal immigrants, members of      the Border Patrol, government officials, and academicians      in both the United States and Mexico. We dug through      official documents and looked at historical, cultural, and      economic factors-operating on both sides of the      border-that influence the flow of migrants. In      addition, we studied human migration in general, in both      its historic and its contemporary forms. As could probably      have been predicted, we found the problems associated with      illegal Mexican immigration to be astonishingly complex,      and the "facts" and impressions given in the popular media      to be seriously misleading.    </p>    <h3>      THE FACTS BEHIND THE FIGURES    </h3>    <p>      For example, the press regularly quotes estimates of this      country's illegal alien population of between 8 and 12      million. It's further asserted-by the United States      media-that this figure is growing by at least 800,000      individuals per year... a statistic based on the official      number of illegal aliens apprehended by the Border Patrol      in each of the last few years. Also, the impression given      in the press is that these immigrants have come to stay and      that the "pool" is rapidly growing.    </p>    <p>      However, the information we were able to gather indicates      that, while a very large portion of the illegal immigrants      are indeed from Mexico, most of them are <em>temporary</em>      residents... so the large number of people apprehended at      the border is not a reasonable measure of the increase in      the "stock" of illegal aliens in this country.    </p>    <p>      In fact, such figures can't be counted on to provide      <em>any</em> real reference to the scope of our illegal      immigration "problem"... for several reasons.    </p>    <p>      First of all, at least 80% of bur Border Patrol is      concentrated along the Mexican border... therefore, it's      hardly surprising that most of the illegal aliens      apprehended are Mexicans.    </p>    <p>      In addition, the INS runs what is essentially a "revolving      door" along the southern border. Illegals are quickly      expelled, and just as quickly return. It's quite possible      for the same person to be apprehended and expelled three or      four times in one week... and one individual in Texas      reportedly was caught five times in one day! Thus, a figure      of 800,000 apprehensions in a year certainly can't be      assumed to represent the number of individuals involved.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the total number of apprehensions tells us      very little about the aliens who aren't caught. Some people      assume that, if 800,000 are being detected, an even larger      number must be getting through... while others argue      that-since so many aliens are being      apprehended-the Border Patrol must be stopping most      of those who try to enter the country.<br />      Finally, of course, the number of apprehensions tells us      nothing about the <em>reverse</em> flow. After all, if      800,000 Mexicans were entering the country illegally each      year at the same time that 900,000 were returning home,      then the total number of non-citizens would be declining.    </p>    <p>      The most careful study-at least at this time-of      the number of illegal residents in the United States      compares various groups of government census and labor      statistics, some of which would be expected to include most      illegals and some to exclude them. The resulting estimate      is of an unregistered alien population of about four      million... <em>which is one-half to one-third of the      numbers most frequently heard previously</em> . At the      moment, this seems to be about the best available figure,      but it doesn't amount to much more than an informed guess.    </p>    <h3>      TEMPORARY EMPLOYMENT    </h3>    <p>      Another factor that's not often considered is the      possibility that illegals are here only temporarily,      expecting to make some money and then return to their      homeland. However, studies that have been done in      Mexico-and interviews with Mexicans who are in the      U.S. illegally-indicate that the vast majority will      return home after a period in the U.S.... perhaps to cross      back again later, when the accumulated money has been used      up. Furthermore, these studies and interviews generally      reveal that most Mexican illegals living here would      <em>prefer</em> to stay in Mexico if they could make      anything resembling a decent wage there.    </p>    <p>      Propaganda to the contrary, it's also apparent that the      Mexican illegals are an economic plus for the United      States. The schizophrenic claims of bigots (on one hand,      illegals are said to work so hard that they displace native      labor, and-on the other-are referred to as      welfare bums) are utterly unsupported. There're many      reasons to believe that very few American citizens are      unemployed because Mexican laborers have taken jobs that      otherwise would be open. It's also clear that illegals pay      (through taxes, social security deductions, and workman's      compensation payments) for a wide variety of services of      which they only rarely take advantage.    </p>    <p>      A substantial portion of the current concern over illegal      Mexican immigration seems to be just one more resurgence of      the <em>Leyenda Negra</em> , an ancient northern European      prejudice against Hispanics that can be traced back to      English horror stories about the <em>conquistadores</em>      and the Spanish Inquisition. Such prejudices have a rich      history in the U.S., too... rooted in a misunderstanding of      Mexican culture and in good old American xenophobia.    </p>    <p>      Few Americans seem to realize that our Southwest was once      part of Mexico and was taken by us in a war of conquest, or      that the Hispanic community was already in place      when-in 1848-the U.S. annexed more than half of      Mexico's territory through the Treaty of Guadalupe      Hidalgo... which ended the U.S.-Mexican War. American      history courses rarely point out that the rights of the      Mexicans living in the newly annexed territory were      systematically denied them, even though those rights had      been guaranteed by the Treaty.    </p>    <h3>      LAST-RESORT LABOR    </h3>    <p>      As one famous student of the subject put it, the Treaty of      Guadalupe Hidalgo "left the toilers on one side of the      border and the best land and the capital on the other."      Ever since modern agriculture and mining began to be      developed in the Southwest, our country has exploited these      "toilers" as a labor pool of last resort. They've been      welcomed when their help was needed and expelled as      shiftless "greasers" and welfare bums when they were no      longer wanted.    </p>    <p>      It's obvious that anti-Hispanic prejudice is involved when      the Mexican immigration situation is contrasted with our      attitudes toward immigrants from Canada. Historically, the      influx of people from the north has placed a far greater      population pressure on the United States than has the      movement from Mexico... but we don't hear about a "Canuck"      menace, and there's no call for fences along the Canadian      border or for a beefed-up northern Border Patrol. (After      all, less than a fifth of our border agents are stationed      there!)    </p>    <p>      In our next column, we'll attempt to evaluate the current      status and impact of Mexican illegals in the United      States... take a look in our cracked and clouded crystal      ball to see what the future may hold... and recommend some      steps that might be taken toward a humane and rational      solution to this "problem", as well as to a number of      related problems of international migration.    </p>    <p>      <em>A detailed discussion of the movements of people      between nations-with special emphasis on      Mexican-American relations-can be found in</em> The      Golden Door: International Migration, Mexico and the United      States, <em>by Paul R.
