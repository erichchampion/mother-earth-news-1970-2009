                <p>      <em>Mike Kerley tells why 1,500 Iowa farmers left their      cornfields to attend a...</em>    </p>        <hr />    <p>      Last July-in a huge, dirt-floored exhibition hall      where some of the finest show cattle in the nation are      generally put on display-1,500 Iowa farmers got      together for a <em>different</em> kind of show, The      occasion was the first Farm Alcohol Field Day, jointly      sponsored by the Iowa Corn Promotion Board (ICPB) and the      Iowa Development Commission... with the cooperation of the      U.S. Department of Energy. It was one of the first      opportunities for experts in the "art and science" of      producing fuel-grade grain alcohol in small, farm-scale      plants to gather in one place... so that the farmers      (who'll be the ones to build and <em>operate</em> such      installations) could get at them.    </p>    <p>      Now it takes more than fancy theories and "pie-in-the-sky"      fantasies to get a passel of hard-workin' sodbusters to      spend a summer Saturday listenin' to speeches... especially      when the jaw-bonin' takes place in a sizzling hot glorified      cow barn! So when the professional men of the soil" jammed      into the State Fairgrounds Livestock Exhibition Hall in Des      Moines, Iowa to listen to the experts discuss on-farm      alcohol fuel production, you can bet the farmers were      bankin' on hearing some worthwhile information.<br />      <br />      "Iowa farmers have decided that they're not going to wait      for the day when their tractors sit idle for lack of fuel,"      explained Thurman Gaskill, ICPB chairman. "They're looking      for energy alternatives," he continued, "and many have      expressed a desire to learn about producing alcohol on      their farms as a means of stretching their fuel supplies."      Gaskill (and who could make up a better name for someone      involved in the fight against petroleum dependence?) went      on to say, "Farmers want to know how to construct an      alcohol still, what's involved in maintaining such      equipment, what the cost factors of distillation are, and      what permits must be obtained." He might have added that      Iowa's corn growers (and the ICPB) are interested in      alcohol fuel for another reason, as well:    </p>    <p>      It would provide the perfect additional market in which to      sell the estimated <em>1.8 billon</em> bushels of      "carryover", or surplus, corn which is produced in the      United States each year.    </p>    <p>      Speakers at the Field Day included Iowa Congressman Berkley      Bedell (one of Washington's strongest alcohol backers) and      Department of Energy representative Bill Holmberg. As the      director of DOE'S Citizen Participation Division, Holmberg      is particularly interested in ensuring that federal      financing and incentives for alcohol production be made      available to small farmers and cooperatives, as well as to      large corporations.    </p>    <p>      On hand to demonstrate the feasibility of on-farm      distillation for the individual farmer were Alan and Diane      Zeithamer of Alexandria, Minnesota. As bona fide working      farmers-talkin' sense to an audience of their fellow      agriculturists-the Zeithamers were the hit of the      fair. (See MOTHER NO. 59, page 80, for more information on      the energy self-sufficiency of these progressive farm      folk.)    </p>    <p>      In a way, the Field Day's only problem was its success.      That's right! Strange as it may seem, so <em>many</em>      interested potential distillers showed up at the      Fairgrounds extravaganza that the kind of one-on-one,      farmer-to-expert discussion which had been planned just      wasn't possible.    </p>    <p>      But, problems or not, the show was a roarin' success. After      all, what could be more important than getting some 1,500      farmers together and letting 'em know that the farm-based      production of fuel is <em>not</em> a pipe dream?
