                        <p>      <em>In 1976, Tom Ferguson-then a fourth-year medical      student at Yale-launched a magazine</em> called      Medical Self-Care . . . <em>which-he      hoped-would serve as "a</em> Whole Earth Catalog      <em>of the best medical books, tools, and resources".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Tom spoke of his plans for the publication-and of      his conviction that self-care could raise the general level      of health in this country and lower our inflated levels of      medical spending-in the Plowboy Interview in MOTHER      NO. 51 . . . and left no doubt that he would work toward      making those "dreams "come true.<br /></em><br />      <em>Well, Tom Ferguson is Doctor Ferguson now, and the      medical self-care "movement"-as well as Tom's      magazine-has flourished. People are beginning to      assume more responsibility for their own well-being and are      eager for information that will help them take better care      of their bodies.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So-in an effort to provide just such very      necessary data-THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) offers as a      regular feature a piece by Tom Ferguson, M.D., called (what      else?) "Medical Self-Care".</em>    </p>    <h3>      THE BASICS OF GOOD EATING    </h3>    <p>      While our national "nutrition consciousness" has expanded      to the extent that many Americans <em>do</em> supplement      their diets with vitamins these days, there's probably no      point on which people's beliefs differ as much as they do      about the values (or hazards) of various types of food.      And-since it's not considered good scientific ethics      to feed a possibly dangerous substance to men and women in      order to test its toxicity-really <em>conclusive</em>      nutrition studies (those done on human beings) are as rare      as hens' teeth.    </p>    <p>      Another element that clouds the whole nutrition issue is      the "placebo phenomenon". You see, the mind is more      powerful in shaping the effects of a food or drug than most      folks think. In one recent study, for example, volunteers      were given a drug that usually produces a violent nausea      and vomiting, but the men and women were told the substance      would relax and soothe their stomachs. Sure enough, the      human "guinea pigs" experienced no queasiness, and internal      measurements showed that their stomachs <em>actually became      more relaxed</em> after the medication was administered!      So, if you believe that a food is good for you, you can      most likely eat that food and feel better . . . regardless      of what the substance may actually be doing to your body      chemistry.    </p>    <p>      A third factor that adds to today's nutritional confusion      is that different individuals can have very different      dietary needs. In tact, if the size of our facial features      varied as much as the concentration of certain enzymes in      our bodies, some of us would have noses the size of BB's,      while others would have 20-foot snouts'    </p>    <h3>      SWEET, SALTY, AND FAT VILLAINS    </h3>    <p>      That's the bad news . . . now, here's the good. In spite of      all the raging controversies in the field, there are four      basic nutritional guidelines which seem to hold true for      nearly everyone <em>and</em> upon which the experts do      agree: [1] Eat less fat, [2] eat less refined sugar, [3]      eat less salt, and [4] avoid suspect food additives,      especially nitrates and saccharin.<br />      Many people, if asked to name the most harmful component in      their diet, would probably say sugar, but-for almost      <em>all</em> North Americans-the worst dietary      villain is fat. The body's need for this substance is very      small, and easily supplied by a diet that includes a      variety of whole grains. Most Americans, however, eat over      40% of their calories in the form of fat-more than 10      times as much of the substance as humans really      need-even though the association between high-fat      diets and heart diseases (which cause more deaths in this      country than all other illnesses combined) is well-known.    </p>    <p>      This largely unnecessary food accumulates in hard, white,      fatty deposits on the inner walls of our arteries . . . and      the atherosclerotic plaques, as they're called, can begin      to form in childhood or early adulthood and may grow until      they block the passageways through which the blood must      flow. Eventually, the narrowing of the coronary arteries      increases the risk of a <em>complete cutoff</em> of blood      to part of the heart's muscle . . . and the result of such      a stoppage is a heart attack. (There's also good evidence      to indicate that a high-fat diet increases one's risk of      both breast <em>and</em> bowel cancer.)    </p>    <p>      There are two sources of fat in our diets: the obvious and      the hidden. The obvious sources include fatty meats, oil,      vegetable shortening, cream, butter, lard, and greasy fried      foods. But many items that one doesn't ordinarily think of      as "fatty"-such as peanut butter, eggs, pizza,      avocados, soybeans, nuts, seeds, many baked goods, and all      dairy products except those made from skim milk-are      also significant sources of the potentially dangerous      substance. The obvious fats should be avoided when      possible, and the others should be eaten only in      moderation.    </p>    <p>      Since salt, on the other hand, is associated with increased      blood pressure, persons with hypertension (high blood      pressure, or HBP) should entirely <em>remove</em> the      saltshakers from their tables. And folks who have relatives      with HBP-since the disease runs in some      families-should also try to decrease their salt      consumption. Likewise, people with diabetes-and those      whose families have a history of diabetes-should be      especially careful not to overdo their sugar intake.    </p>    <h3>      BETTER HEALTH COSTS LESS    </h3>    <p>      Naturally, when you change your diet to exclude foods that      are high in fat, sugar, salt, and additives-and to      incorporate more whole grains, beans, and      vegetables-be sure to make the switch gradually. If      there are some "junk foods" you really love, just      substitute nutritious foods of similar taste or texture:      banana chips for potato chips, fruit juice for milk shakes,      baked potatoes for french fries, and fresh fruit whipped up      in the blender for jams and jellies.    </p>    <p>      In addition to providing a better nutritional balance,      eating foods closer to their natural state will sometimes      result in lower food bills. In general, processed foods are      both higher in the big bad three (fat, sugar, and salt)      <em>and</em> more expensive than their fresh counterparts.      For example, you can sometimes buy potatoes for as little      as a dime a pound, while a pound of fast food trench fries      would cost about $2.00.    </p>    <h3>      READ ALL ABOUT IT    </h3>    <p>      In order to provide more information on good eating than it      would be possible to include on this page, I've compiled a      list of resources you can use to help cut the cost of a      healthful diet and-at the same time-make you      feel your best.    </p>    <p>      The "New American Eating Guide" is a handy, four-color      poster that divides everyday foods into three categories:      foods to eat anytime . . . those to eat in moderation . . .      and some to sample now and then. (I'd like to see this      valuable tool for nutritious eating taped to <em>every</em>      refrigerator door.) To get your copy, send $2.00 to the      Center for Science in the Public Interest, Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 7226, Washington, D.C. 20044.    </p>    <p>      <em>Laurel's Kitchen: A Handbook for Vegetarian Cookery and      Nutrition</em> by Laurel Robertson, Carol Flinders, and      Bronwen Godfrey combines a fine cookbook with a 150-page      introduction to the essentials of nutrition, plus one of      the most easily used nutrition tables I've seen. It's      available for $15 from some bookstores, or for the same      price-plus 95 cents shipping and handling-from      Mother's Bookshelf, P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28739.    </p>    <p>      <em>Diet and Nutrition</em> by R.M. Ballentine, M.D., a      wholistic "I-Ching of nutrition books", offers a      comprehensive review of scientific nutritional research and      reports both sides of many controversial issues: Dr.      Ballentine presents the evidence and lets you come to your      own conclusions. The work may be purchased for $8.95      postpaid from the Himalayan Institute Press, Dept. TMEN, RD      1, Box 88, Honesdale, Pennsylvania 18431.    </p>    <p>      "Which Fast Foods Are Best?" (an article published in      <em>Consumer Reports,</em> September 1979) concludes that      fast foods are nutritionally acceptable if consumed      infrequently and as only <em>part</em> of a well-balanced      diet . . . suggests that regular fast-food customers skip      the shakes and fries . . . and points out a heartening      development: Some fast-food chains are adding salad bars. A      copy of this issue is available for $1.25 postpaid from      <em>Consumer Reports</em> , Dept. TMEN, Orangeburg, New      York 10962.    </p>
