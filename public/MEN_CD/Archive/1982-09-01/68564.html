                <p>      <em>More folks are spending vacations caring for their most      important friends . . . themselves!</em>    </p>        <p>      Regular readers know that MOTHER tries to present many      different life choices within these pages. That's why it's      possible to see an article on butchering pork in the same      issue as a selection of meatless sandwich recipes! And, in      keeping with this philosophy, we've rounded up some      information on what's been called "The Vacation of the      80's" . . . and plan to explore with you the excitement,      the hard work, <em>and</em> the fun associated with      spending some time at a fitness resort.    </p>    <p>      Keeping fit has become an American pastime, and has given      birth to a multimilliondollar industry, with facilities      that range from corner YMCA's to posh five-star luxury      resorts. Now we realize that a lot of folks don't have the      time, the money, or even the <em>inclination</em> to visit      such places (and after all, a few hours spent chopping wood      can benefit the body while it fills the woodbin!). However,      if you're in the market for a vacation spot that offers      pleasant accommodations, good food, and sports and      recreational facilities . . . a health resort is hard to      beat. To top it all off, you may just lose a few pounds,      shrink a few inches, gain a better understanding of how      best to care for your body, and - perhaps most      important of all - develop a new, improved set of      fitness habits.    </p>    <p>      But, you may well want to know, what can one expect when      visiting a spa for a weeklong program? In most cases,      you'll get an initial physical examination by a staff      doctor and a consultation with a nutritionist. You can also      anticipate following a dietary regimen consisting of 500 to      1,000 calories per day, or a fasting program of fruit juice      or mineral water. All such resorts feature group exercise      classes, and allow time for individual workouts on      machines, weights, and stationary bicycles. Swimming pools      are practically mandatory, as are saunas and whirlpools.      Most spas start each day with a brisk walk, hike, or jog .      . . and further exercise is encouraged (often tennis, golf,      or horseback riding). Various beauty services are usually      offered, too . . . such as facials, massages, herbal wraps,      and makeup and hair consultations.    </p>    <p>      Originally the word "spa" meant a mineral spring, or a      resort having a mineral spring on its premises. Today the      term encompasses any commercial establishment with exercise      rooms, saunas, and whirlpools. The list that follows is      separated into three categories: true "spas" built around      hot mineral springs . . . health "farms" that emphasize      fasting, vegetarianism, and a wholistic lifestyle . . . and      the luxurious reports that specialize in pampering souls      while reshaping bodies. Most of these places have seasonal      rates, and - if the spa experience fits your      lifestyle and budget - this may be the best time of      year to go. (All rates quoted are based on 1982 brochures.)    </p>             <p>      <strong>"OF THE WATERS AND THEIR POWERS. . ."</strong>    </p>    <p>      Desert Hot Springs Spa. About 1000 B.C. (give or take a few      decades), a huge tremor shook the earth . . . created the      San Andreas Fault in California . . . and released the hot      mineral water that gushes from below the Desert Hot Springs      Spa near Palm Springs, California. Located 1,200 feet above      the surrounding arid expanse of sand, with views of Mt. San      Jacinto, this spa boasts of being the only resort in the      world to offer the combination of hot mineral waters      <em>and</em> a dry, desert climate. The therapeutic liquid      bubbles from the earth at temperatures of up to 140°F      and is odorless, crystal clear, and delicious.    </p>    <p>      A chiropractor and nutritionist are on staff for      consultation . . . and special package deals are available,      one of which offers six days and five nights for $173 per      person, double occupancy. (For more information, write to      Desert Hot Springs Spa, Dept. TMEN, 10805 Palm Drive,      Desert Hot Springs, California 92240 . . . or call 714/      329-6495.)    </p>    <p>      Fairmont Hot Springs Resort. There are actually      <em>two</em> Fairmont spas, one located between Anaconda      and Butte, Montana . . . the other nestled in the Canadian      Rockies between Golden and Cranbrook, British Columbia.      Both feature golf, swimming, angling, hot mineral pools . .      . and wintertime diversions such as skiing, ice-fishing,      and snowmobiling.    </p>    <p>      The Anaconda- Pintlar Wilderness area - with its      campgrounds, hiking trails, and wildlife - is near      the U.S. Fairmont. Although the resort emphasizes family      fun and entertainment more than fitness and weight loss,      the naturally heated hot springs (ranging from 98° to      112°F) do attract folks seeking the water's reputed      benefits. The double-occupancy daily rate for a motel-like      room is $48. (Details are available from Fairmont Hot      Springs Resort, Dept. TMEN, Anaconda, Montana 59711, 406/      797-3241 . . . or telephone the Canadian resort at      604/345-6311.)    </p>    <p>      Hot Springs Lodge, Pool, and Athletic Club. Situated near      the more famous resorts of Aspen and Vail, Hot Springs      credits itself with the largest naturally warmed, open-air      mineral water pool in the world. The twoblock-long facility      is heated by the flowing Yampah Hot Springs and then cooled      to a comfortable swimming temperature by mountain spring      water. (However, a nearby thermal pool is maintained at a      muscle-pleasing 104°F.) The atmosphere is informal, and      the emphasis is on exercise rather than diet (this is not a      club for folks whose express purpose is to lose weight).      Double-occupancy room rates average $40 per day, while an      additional $9.50 is charged for use of the athletic club.      (Contact Hot Springs Lodge and Pool, Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      308, Glenwood Springs, Colorado 81602, 303/9456571.)    </p>    <p>      Safety Harbor Spa. Initially founded to provide access to      the famed Espiritu Santo Springs and their reputed      restorative powers, this luxury resort hotel and tennis      club complex has since expanded to offer much more. Located      on Old Tampa Bay between Tampa and Clearwater, Florida,      Safety Harbor features an indoor therapy pool (with      swirling waters maintained at 98°F), mineral baths, a      whirlpool, "his and her" solariums, yoga instruction, and      the services of a variety of medical experts . . . as well      as the usual tennis, golf, and water sports. The resort is      open only from December to May, and double-occupancy rates      average $108 per person per day. (You can find out more      from Safety Harbor Spa, Dept. TMEN, Safety Harbor, Florida      33572, 800/237-0155 ... in Canada and Florida call      813/726-1161 collect.)    </p>    <p>      San Carlos Inn. When Ponce de Léon traveled from      Spain to the New World in search of the Fountain of Youth,      he may well have been responding to tales about the warm      mineral springs located behind the San Carlos Inn in Fort      Myers, Florida. It's said that the waters come from deep      within the earth - a full quarter-mile down -      and about a <em>million</em> gallons of the warm      (90.26°F), bubbly, mineral-rich liquid spew forth each      day. The springs have been judged to be some of the finest      in the world, rivaling those of the more famous mineral      spas in Baden-Baden in Germany and Aixles-Bains in France.    </p>    <p>      Additional features include freshwater swimming, fishing,      canoeing, golf, bicycling, and exercise facilities. The inn      itself is fairly modest, and the off season      double-occupancy room rate (from May 1 to December 15) is a      reasonable $32 per night. (Write or call San Carlos Inn,      Dept. TMEN, Rt. 22, Box 800, Fort Myers, Florida 33908,      813/481-3818.)    </p>		<p><strong>"THEY THAT BE WHOLE NEED NOT A PHYSICIAN . . ."</strong></p>    <p>      The Ashram. This austere, no-frills resort, located 45      minutes north of Los Angeles, reputedly packs a powerful      punch . . . from all reports, it takes real      <em>stamina</em> to last out one's stay! Eight guests are      selected each week (through extensive telephone      interviews), and those who are permitted to come are      subjected to grueling physical workouts, especially hiking      in the mountains surrounding the retreat. The diet is      primarily raw, <em>always</em> vegetarian fare . . .      consisting of fruits, vegetables, seeds, sprouts, nuts, and      berries. Guests lose weight . . . but - more notably      - they lose inches, and they work muscles that they      often never knew existed! The weekly rate is $1,100 per      person. (The Ashram's address is Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 8,      Calabasas, California 91302 . . . telephone 213/ 888-0232.)    </p>    <p>      Hippocrates World Health Organization. Folks come to the      Hippocrates Institute in Boston, Massachusetts in order to      learn a new lifestyle . . . a process which involves      attending daily classes and participating in a two-week      "learn by doing" program. Ann Wigmore is the founder and      president of the institute, whose exercise program      emphasizes flexibility, proper posture, and deep breathing      . . . and whose diet regimen relies heavily on      chlorophyll-rich greens and wheatgrass.    </p>    <p>      The Hippocrates philosophy maintains that the body is      always capable of healing itself . . . given proper (raw      food) nourishment, a positive mental attitude, and adequate      exercise. The institute also offers a ten-week      comprehensive wholistic training program. The two-week rate      is $1,300, while children aged 3 to 16 and the second      person in a couple can stay for half price. The rates are      20% lower from November through March, too. (Contact      Hippocrates World Health Organization, Dept. TMEN, 25      Exeter Street, Boston, Massachusetts 02116, 617/267-9525.)    </p>    <p>      Kripalu Holistic Health Center. See the sidebar      accompanying this article.    </p>    <p>      Little Switzerland Wholistic Health Center and Mountain      Health Retreat. Situated in the beautiful and rugged      mountains of western Colorado, Little Switzerland's      philosophy rests in rediscovering the ancient laws of      Mother Nature that govern body, mind, and consciousness.      Founded by Drs. Paul and Marie Farber, the center offers      wholistic health-care seminars ... and provides polarity      balancing, acupuncture, hot mineral baths, massage,      hydrotherapy, biofeedback, and more.    </p>    <p>      A week-long analysis and treatment program may cost $200 to      $500 (depending upon individual needs), and accommodations      are arranged for clients at nearby motels - with      mineral spa facilities - for about $35 a day per      person. (To find out more about this organization, write to      the Wholistic World Healing Foundation, Dept. TMEN, P.O.      Box 236, Ouray, Colorado 81427 . . . or call 303/325-4911.)    </p>    <p>      New Age Health Farm of Neversink. This rural retreat in      upstate New York has combined the characteristics of a      "classic" European health spa with a New Age awareness of      the interconnection of mind, body, and spirit. The farm      specializes in fasting (water or fruit juice) and weight      loss, using the wholistic approach, and activities are      planned to nourish the spirit and the mind as well as the      body. Staff members also offer beauty consultations and      treatments, using natural products. Weekly Double-occupancy      rates begin at $234 per person. (Contact New Age Health      Farm, Dept. TMEN, Neversink, New York 12765, 914/      985-2221.)    </p>    <p>      Pawling Health Manor. The folks at Pawling have been      promoting the wholistic approach to health for over 20      years, and not only can they help their guests lose weight      and tone up, but they also have an effective "stop smoking"      program. (Warning: Smoking is <em>never</em> permitted.)      Daily workshops in nutrition, vegetarianism, fasting, and      food preparation are offered . . . as are "relaxacise"      classes, the use of a fully equipped gymnasium, and      nutritious meals. The atmosphere is informal, and weekly      rates start at $330 per person. (Details are available from      Pawling Health Manor, Dept. TMEN, Box 401, Hyde Park, New      York 12538, 914/889-4141.)    </p>    <p>      Shangri-La Natural Health Resort. <em>This</em> Shangri-La      views good health as the essential pathway to happiness.      The program is totally natural, focusing on yoga and      fasting (or, if eating at all, the use of wholesome organic      foods). No canned or frozen products are ever served, and      "the vegetarian cuisine reigns supreme". Double-occupancy      rates for May through December, 1982 average $38 per person      per day . . . and the resort offers a 10% discount to      guests who stay three months or longer. (Contact Shangri-La      Natural Health Resort, Dept. TMEN, Bonita Springs, Florida      33923, 813/992-3811.)    </p>           <p>      <strong>"WHERE MONEY IS NO OBJECT. . ."</strong>    </p>    <p>      Canyon Ranch Spa. Situated on 28 acres in the foothills of      Tucson, Arizona's majestic Santa Catalina Mountains, the      Canyon Ranch Spa boasts 360 sunny days each year, and      offers a 28,000-square-foot, climate-controlled building      for non-sun worshipers. Three gyms host 15 exercise classes      a day, and racquetball, weight training, hiking, swimming,      jogging, golf, and horseback riding are offered, as well.      Mealtime portions are determined by one's need to lose,      maintain, or gain weight . . . and all recipes are      available for the residents to take home. Double-occupancy      rates - which include three meals <em>plus</em> full      use of all facilities - average $120 per person per      day. (You can learn more by getting in touch with the      Canyon Ranch Spa, Dept. TMEN, 8600 East Rockcliff Road,      Tucson, Arizona 85715, 602/749-9000.)    </p>    <p>      The Greenbrier. A spa is just one of <em>numerous</em>      facilities available to guests at this gracious resort in      the Allegheny Mountains of West Virginia. The Greenbrier is      <em>not</em> specifically geared toward fitness and weight      loss, and there's no diet regimen. But since it's truly a      sports(wo)man's paradise, anyone with a dash of      self-discipline should have no problem shedding a few      pounds while enjoying a luxurious vacation. In addition to      the renowned mineral baths, whirlpools, sauna, steam rooms,      and massage services, the Greenbrier offers <em>three</em>      18-hole golf courses, 20 tennis courts (including five      air-conditioned <em>indoor</em> ones), trap and skeet      ranges, and an eight-lane bowling center ... plus      shuffleboard, horseshoes, bicycling, fishing, hiking,      jogging, and horseback riding. Guesthouse rates average      $110 per person per day, and a limited number of golf and      tennis cottages are available for $78 per person . . . all      the prices include breakfasts and dinners. (Write or call      the Greenbrier, Dept. TMEN, White Sulphur Springs, West      Virginia 24986, 800/624-6070.)    </p>    <p>      Lido Spa. If you're interested in getting suntanned as well      as slim, you might want to consider the Lido Spa, nestled      in the heart of Miami Beach, Florida. This facility      actually <em>guarantees</em> weight loss: A staff dietician      consults with each guest and plans an individually tailored      program. Included in the cost of accommodations are a      physical exam and daily massage . . . the use of golf,      tennis, and spa facilities . . . and all meals.      Double-occupancy daily rates in the fall season start at      $38 per person. (Contact the Lido Spa, Dept. TMEN, 40      Island Avenue, Venetian Causeway, Miami Beach, Florida      33139, 800/327-8363.)    </p>    <p>      The World of Palm-Aire. One of Florida's - and the      nation's - most luxurious health resorts, Palm-Aire      offers a seven-day "executive fitness" program for men and      a seven-day "renaissance spa" program for women. Other      options include a four-day plan designed for maximum weight      loss and cardiovascular fitness . . . and a four-day spa      and sports plan that combines exercise with the use of      Palm-Aires numerous recreational facilities: five 18-hole      golf courses, 37 tennis courts, four racquetball courts,      salt- and freshwater swimming pools, and a jogging course      with exercise stations positioned along it. The      double-occupancy daily rate for a seven-day package is      $311. (Write or call Palm-Aire, Dept. TMEN, 2501 Palm-Aire      Drive North, Pompano Beach, Florida 33060, 800/327-4960 . .      . in Florida or Canada, 305/972-3300.)    </p>    <p>      The Phoenix. The problem with most health spa      vacations-according to the directors of the Phoenix-is that      the benefits accrued tend to disappear, since the      participants all too often resume their previous habits      after they leave. To prevent that, the Phoenix offers a      program (for women only) that emphasizes behavioral      re-education and provides practical guidelines that can be      applied at home.    </p>    <p>      The training takes place in an elegant setting amid the 26      wooded acres of a former estate in Houston, Texas. Mornings      are devoted to exercise, afternoons to beauty      "indulgences", and evenings to lectures and discussions.      The all-inclusive cost per week is $2,175. (You can get      more information from the Phoenix, Dept. TMEN, 111 North      Post Oak Lane, Houston, Texas 77024, 713/680-1601.)    </p>    <p>      Sea Pines Behavioral Institute. Sea Pines bills itself as      "a health education center specializing in health      maintenance, habit change, and weight control". The thrust      of this spa's program is, again, behavior modification.      Self-control, relaxation, and stress management techniques      are basic. All participants are entitled to follow-up      consultations for a full year after their stay, and      graduate "booster" sessions are held periodically to      reinforce the lifestyle changes encouraged by the resort's      staff. The institute, located within the Sea Pines      Plantation on beautiful Hilton Head Island, South Carolina,      provides ample recreational opportunities as well. An      all-inclusive 26-day residential program costs $3,500.      (Contact Sea Pines Behavioral Institute, Sea Pines Resort,      Dept. TMEN, Hilton Head Island, South Carolina 29928,      803/6716181.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, the resorts mentioned here constitute only a      sampling of the fitness spas available in the U.S. Most      such enterprises will be happy to send you a brochure      describing their facilities.    </p>    <p>      <em>One of MOTHER's staffers recently attended a      stress-reduction/learn-to-relax weekend at the Kripalu      Center for Holistic Health in the Blue Mountains of      Pennsylvania. Here are some of her impressions.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>KRIPALU: REJUVENATION THROUGH RELAXATION</strong>    </p>    <p>      "How many ways do you depend on your body for everything      you want in life?" This question - posed by the      Kripalu Center for Holistic Health in virtually all of its      literature - is really the cornerstone of the staffs      philosophy. And, of course, it <em>does</em> help one      realize how truly important good health, vitality, and a      sense of well-being are to the enjoyment of day-to-day      living.    </p>    <p>      As you might imagine, Kripalu - named after the late      Swami Shri Kripalvanandji, who was guru to the founder      - is more than a health resort. It's a complete New      Age community situated on approximately 240 acres in the      central section of eastern Pennsylvania, northwest of      Reading. The Center for Holistic Health is only one portion      of the complex, and was created four years ago in response      to repeated requests for information - on diet,      exercise, and such - from guests attending programs      at the "parent" yoga retreat. The center's initial staff of      three quickly blossomed into a contingent of 45 full-time      workers, including health-care professionals in the areas      of physical therapy, kinesiology, homeopathic medicine, and      clinical psychology. Monthlong, week-long, and weekend      programs are now conducted throughout the year . . .      dealing with subjects as diverse as skin care, crisis      counseling, raw juice fasting, and breaking the smoking      habit.    </p>    <p>      There are few steadfast "rules" at Kripalu. The health      center's staffers feel that the best regimen for one      individual might not be as beneficial for another ...      therefore, every guest is free to pick and choose from a      variety of activities and health services. Personal growth      is heavily emphasized, however, as is attunement to one's      physical, mental, and spiritual needs. Guests are      encouraged not only to eat healthful foods and to take      plenty of exercise, but also to be reflective and to relax.      The focus is on preventive care - through diet,      stress reduction, yoga, and so forth - more than it      is on healing. And, although there are two physicians and      two physical therapists on staff, Kripalu doesn't advertise      itself as a treatment center and makes no promises of quick      cures.    </p>    <p>      The center is typically booked several sessions in advance,      and facilities limit the number of workshop participants to      about 25. Furthermore, although a broad spectrum of people      participate in the programs, the guests tend to be in their      30's or 40's, middle class, more often female than male,      and - naturally - keenly interested in      achieving a more holistic lifestyle.    </p>    <p>      The peaceful rural setting provided by the surrounding Blue      Mountains offers great opportunities for strolling,      jogging, biking, and hiking. (Indeed, the Appalachian Trail      is well within walking distance of the compound.) A      three-acre lake on the property tempts guests with the      opportunity to canoe ... and an Olympic-sized pool is open      for swimming in the summer and iceskating in the winter!      Guests may also make appointments to receive health      services from the professional staff. Among those offered      are hair analysis for trace minerals, polarity therapy,      reflexology (foot massage), yoga therapy, colonic      irrigation, facials, deep tissue massage, and psychological      counseling.    </p>    <p>      A typical day's schedule begins at 5:00 a.m., when the      guests are gently awakened by the sound of a melodious      African instrument. Then, at 5:20, the body-work specialist      greets everyone out in the yard for stretching and warmup      exercises. Next comes a walk or a jog - depending on      each person's preference - followed by an hour of      yoga. Breakfast, usually consisting of cooked whole grains      and homemade yogurt, is served at 7:30. (Unfortunately, the      health center raises little of its own food, but does      obtain organically grown produce from a local farmers'      market, make its own yogurt and soy food products, and grow      its own sprouts.)    </p>    <p>      After breakfast there are workshops until midmorning . . .      then guests are free to keep their various health-care      appointments, relax in the sauna or hot tub, enjoy a nap,      or walk about the complex. Lunch - the main meal of      the day - usually consists of a large green salad,      whole grain bread, and a vegetarian casserole. Fresh fruit      and herbal teas are always available to the guests, as      well. More workshops and/or therapy sessions follow in the      afternoon, and a light supper of soup and salad is served      at 5:30 p.m. Between the evening meal and bedtime (at 9:00      p.m.), it's often possible to meet with the retreat's      founder, Yogi Desai, and listen as he talks, reads from a      favorite work, or fields questions.    </p>    <p>      There is - according to our staffer - a feeling      of peace surrounding the center, and it's difficult      <em>not</em> to relax in the atmosphere of caring that      envelops the place. The Kripalu personnel are supportive of      each other <em>and</em> of their guests, who are treated      like close family friends.    </p>    <p>      Rates vary with the program being offered. Many weekend      workshops, for example, are priced as low as $70 . . .      while week-long programs cost from $300 to $400. The fees      cover modest accommodations, three meals a day, and use of      the sauna and hot tub. Health services such as massage can      be had for an extra fee.
