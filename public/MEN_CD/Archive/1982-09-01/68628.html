                <p>      <em>Here's a pork-and-hominy favorite from Mexico that      might be the most gut-satisfying, gizzard-tickling,      stick-to-your-ribs soup you and your family have ever eaten      on a chilly autumn day.</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Burley Packwood    </h5>        <p>      <strong>Burley Packwood</strong>    </p>        <p>      Hominy is made by boiling soaked corn in a hydrated lime      solution to loosen the hulls.    </p>    <p>      Ask ten random <em>norteamericanos</em> what      <em>pozole</em> (pronounced poh-soh-lay) is, and you may      very well get ten blank stares in response. And that's an      unfortunate state of affairs, because this hearty Mexican      pork-and-hominy soup is one of the best tasting, most      satisfying, and <em>economical</em> concoctions ever to be      ladled into a bowl.    </p>    <p>      Folks down Guadalajara way, in the Mexican state of      Jalisco, will swear that their cooks prepare the only      <em>true</em> pozole, while many <em>señores</em>      and <em>señoras</em> from nearby Michoacan (who have      their own cooking methods) will tell you that      <em>their</em> region's version is the authentic one. The      truth is that pozole - like most hearty soups and      stews - can be made in a number of ways . . . varying      with such factors as personal taste and what's in the      larder on a given day. In fact, it seems that almost every      pozole chef has his or her own pet recipe. I learned mine      (which, of course, I believe is the best going) from a lady      named Conchita, and it's peasant-style all the way.    </p>    <p>      To prepare it, you'll need the following ingredients:    </p>		<p>		2 pounds of fresh boneless pork 2 pounds of pork neck    bones (for stock) 2 tablespoons of salt (or enough to suit    your taste) 2 cans (15-ounce) of white or yellow hominy,    drained 2 tablespoons of powdered <em>pasilla</em> chile (or    California chile or ordinary chile powder . . . see the    sidebar )		</p>           <p>      If you prefer to prepare your own hominy (it's easy to make      and will taste a whole lot better than the store-bought      kind), the sidebar that accompanies this article will tell      you how to produce the amount needed to whip up a batch of      pozole. And if you really want to "go native", try      substituting a pig's head for the neck bones when preparing      your stock. <em>Olé</em> .    </p>    <p>      Start your soup by placing the stock meat and the boneless      pork in a heavy kettle or Dutch oven and covering them with      water. Then add the salt, bring the mixture to a boil, and      simmer it - uncovered - for about an hour . . .      or until the neck (or head) meat separates easily from the      bones and the chunk of pork is tender. At that point, you      can remove the kettle from the heat and skim the grease off      the broth. (If you'd like to remove the fat completely, you      can simply refrigerate the stock overnight, <em>then</em>      skim it.)    </p>           <p>      When the bones are cool enough to handle, pick the meat      from them and cut the remaining pork into serving-sized      pieces. Discard the fat and bones, and return the meat to      the pot with the stock. Then add the hominy and chile, and      simmer the soup - covered - for 2 to 3 hours.      (The longer you cook it, the better it'll get!)    </p>    <p>      While the spicy treat is simmering, prepare shredded raw      cabbage, chopped onion, chopped radishes (these are      optional), and fresh lime halves or quarters as condiments,      placing them on the table in individual serving bowls.    </p>    <p>      Once you're satisfied that the soup is ready, bring the      kettle to the table and ladle out your pozole directly from      the pot. (If you happened to use a pig's head for the      stock, chop up the ears and stir them into your      pork-and-hominy pottage . . . giving it that <em>extra</em>      touch of authenticity!)    </p>    <p>      Dig down deep to serve portions thick with pork and hominy,      but fill the bowls only half to two-thirds full . . .      because there's lots more to come. Now, you see, each diner      can doctor his or her serving by heaping the raw onion,      cabbage, and radish on top . . . and then squeezing lime      juice over everything. The cutup vegetables are traditional      accompaniments for true pozole, but the lime juice is      absolutely mandatory. If you omit it, you'll be serving a      different dish entirely!    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOT SECRETS ABOUT CHILE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Trying to identify the various types of powdered chile can      be as confusing as U.S. foreign policy. In fact, I once      precipitated a small-scale family crisis in a Mexican food      store when I tried to purchase some pasilla chile. The      10-year-old clerk pointed to one barrel, his 11-year-old      brother to a second, and their father - the store's      owner - to a third. The funny thing is, each could      have been correct. There simply is no universally agreed      upon nomenclature for chiles.    </p>    <p>      The wise shopper, therefore, chooses powdered chile by      taste and smell. Place your finger in the spice and sample      it, then sniff. If your sinuses clear, your vision becomes      fuzzy, and your scalp begins to sweat, that particular      variety <em>may</em> be more than you can handle! As a      rule, <em>gringos</em> who are unfamiliar with very hot      foods should avoid serrano and jalapeño chiles. I      enjoy (and recommend) the fullbodied pasilla, New Mexico,      and California chiles . . . but let discretion be your      guide!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE HOW-TO OF HOMEMADE HOMINY</strong>    </p>    <p>      I visit Mexico fairly frequently, and when I return, I      always bring back a few kilos of local pozole corn to use      when making my own hominy. (I also take the precaution of      roasting the already dried corn for 30 minutes, at      275°F, to eliminate weevils.)    </p>    <p>      Of course, you don't have to go to Mexico to get corn      that's appropriate for hominy. You can use dent, flint, or      a hybrid field corn with a high-protein and low-starch      content. Just make certain before you start the process      that the kernels of whatever corn variety you choose are      hard and bone dry.    </p>    <p>      To begin, soak about 2 cups of dried whole-kernel corn in      water overnight. Then drain the grain, place it in a 6- or      8-quart stainless steel pot, cover it with water, and add 3      to 4 tablespoons of hydrated lime . . . the kind that can      be purchased in hardware or lumber stores. (I prefer lime      to lye for soaking off corn hulls, though the latter      substance can be used . . . at a ratio of 4 level      tablespoons for every 2 gallons of water. However, remember      that both materials are caustics and should be mixed only      in stainless steel, glass, or <em>unchipped</em> enamelware      containers.)    </p>    <p>      After stirring the solution thoroughly with a wooden spoon,      boil the corn for about 30 minutes, or until the hulls      begin to loosen, adding water to the pot if needed. (NOTE:      When using either a lime or a lye solution, remember that      the caustic steam can actually "burn" you just as badly as      can the chemicals in their liquid or solid form.) Then      remove it from the heat, cover it, and allow the grain to      soak for another 30 minutes. This completes the softening      process and saves energy that would be wasted by continued      boiling.    </p>    <p>      The final step is to drain the cooked hominy in a colander      and thoroughly rinse the kernels with cold water. After the      water has been running over the corn for a few minutes,      shuck off the hulls by rubbing handfuls of hominy between      your palms. (I find that this isn't really much of a task,      since the cooking has already done most of the work.)    </p>    <p>      Once you're through, you'll have a batch of fresh hominy to      use in your authentic, delicious pozole <em>.</em>      [EDITOR'S NOTE: See MOTHER NO. 46, page 72 for information      on cooking with dried corn to produce other Mexican      delicacies.
