                    <h5 id="byline">      by Eliot Coleman    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>An ingenious market gardener has worked out a      way to grow food and cover crops-at the same      time.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      Eliot Coleman, farm manager <em>of</em> Milton Academy's      Mountain School Program in Vermont, has been a leading      practitioner <em>of</em> organic growing for 20 years. This      fall brings the publication of his first book, The New      Organic Grower-a treatise <em>of</em> growing      techniques that's the best market-gardening guide we've      seen in many a year. Coleman's book has much useful      information that can be adapted to home gardens as well,      such as the following excerpt on innovative ways to combine      both soil-building and edible crops.    </p>
