        <h3>From Country Lore - Dec/Jan 2005<br /></h3><p>I canâ€™t believe I thought baking soda was only for baking; I could have been using it to clean, scrub and deodorize.</p><p>I make my own disinfectant cleaner by combining four parts baking soda with one part borax. I store the mixture in a shaker and then use it as a soft-scrubbing cleaner. It safely scrubs away soils and grease without scratching surfaces or putting harmful chemicals into the environment.</p><p>Used in the kitchen, baking soda cleans sinks, countertops, microwaves, pots and pans, cutting boards and food containers. Stick a small box of this miracle material in the refrigerator to eliminate odors. When casserole dishes have burned food stuck on them, just fill the dish with hot water, add 1 tablespoon baking soda and let it soak. Keep garbage disposals fresh by putting in several inches of warm water and a handful of baking soda. Turn on the disposal and let the water run out.</p><p>Baking soda also works great in bathrooms. It safely removes tough dirt and soap scum on sinks, tubs, showers and toilets, and it is a super grout cleaner.</p><h5>Marti French<br />Jefferson, Colorado</h5>
