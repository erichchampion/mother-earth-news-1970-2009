        <h3>From Country Lore - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>The August/September 2005 article “<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Organic_Gardening/2005_August_September/Wonderful_Winter_Squash" target="_blank">Wonderful Winter Squash</a>” left out one important nutritional aspect of squash - the seeds. You will get a bonanza of great flavor and nutrition from squash and pumpkin seeds, which are loaded with protein and fiber.</p><p>First wash the seeds and pat dry with a paper towel. Then place them in a single layer on an oiled baking pan, season with salt and/or herbs and spices, and let them sit for an hour. Put the pan into a 325-degree oven for about 30 minutes, stirring after about 15 minutes of baking. Watch carefully so they do not burn. You want them to be crunchy and easy to eat, but not fibrous.</p><h5>Scott Smith<br />Hesperia, California</h5><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>
