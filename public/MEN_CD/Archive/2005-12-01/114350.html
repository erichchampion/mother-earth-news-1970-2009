    <p>
                    <h3>      Look carefully, and you'll discover that the coldest season      is a great time to explore nature.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Terry Krautwurst    </h5>        <p>      Tracks in the snow, glistening icicles, a deer nibbling on      low branches??these are only a few of the many pleasures of      winter exploring. But if you look and listen just a bit      more closely, youll also discover that the frozen world is      full of less-than-obvious natural wonders that most of us      dont see simply because we dont take the time. Here are      some examples.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Touch of Velvet</strong>    </p>    <p>      Standing in stoic defiance of icy temperatures that would      flash freeze most other fungi, the tawny-capped winter      mushroom, Flammulina    </p>    <p>      velutipes, fruits in the dead of winter even in the most      northern states, giving heart to winter-weary shroom      hunters who are in search of something??anything??to put in      their gathering baskets.    </p>    <p>      Also called the velvet foot mushroom for its soft, fuzzy      base, this is the wild version of the commercially      cultivated enoki mushroom. Enokis, however, are grown in      sawdust in the dark, resulting in light-starved mushrooms      with long, thin stems and tiny caps that look more like      bean sprouts than fungi. Wild winter mushrooms have thick      stems and wide, fleshy caps.    </p>    <p>      Watch for these hardy survivors standing in little clusters      at the feet of elms and other woodland trees. But unless      youre an expert, dont even think about eating them??theyre      easily confused with an aptly named look-alike, the deadly      galerina.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Hoot Suitors</strong>    </p>    <p>      At dusk, if you think you hear the soft cooing of a      mourning dove, listen again more carefully. It may be the      similar-sounding but distinctive hoo-hoo hooooo hoo-hoo of      a great horned owl.    </p>    <p>      Known as the feathered tiger of the air, great horned owls      are ferocious predators of anything and everything they can      get their talons on??from beetles, frogs and fish to      rabbits, raccoons, porcupines and domestic cats.    </p>    <p>      But starting in December, great horned owls turn their      attention to mating and fill the evening air with      come-hither hoots and other vocalizations. If youre lucky,      you might spy a pair flirting at twilight in a courtship      ritual that includes spreading their wings, bowing their      heads and clicking their beaks. By late January in most      areas, females sit silently atop eggs??a pair,      usually??that will hatch a month later, in time for the      young to mature enough to feed on springs fresh supply of      infant animals. Look for great horned owls in the abandoned      stick nests of crows or hawks.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Woolly Brrrrr</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sift beneath leaves or peek under a snow-dusted log, and      you may discover a curled-up, apparently lifeless      black-and-brown-banded caterpillar??the famed woolly bear      said to predict the severity of winters by the lushness of      its fuzzy coat. Dont give it up for dead just yet, though.    </p>    <p>      Like a variety of other overwintering creatures, woolly      bears produce an internal antifreeze called glycerol that      protects their vital organs from subfreezing temperatures.      But more than simply preventing freezing, the woolly bear      is able to endure the formation of ice crystals in its body      by limiting the growth of ice to the spaces between tissue      cells. Meanwhile, it produces sugars that keep its blood      and cellular water in liquid form. Come the thaw in early      spring, the frozen bear will rouse itself, find a sheltered      place on which to spin a cocoon and pupate. In early      summer, a handsome Isabella tiger moth (Pyrrharctia      isabella) emerges.    </p>    <p>      Woolly bears are only one of dozens of freeze-tolerant      species, including some turtles as well as many insects in      either the adult, larval or pupal stage. Perhaps most      astounding is the wood frogs ability to withstand being      frozen without (ahem) croaking. In winter, its entire      abdominal cavity fills with ice, completely encasing all      its internal organs. Its blood stops flowing; breathing and      heartbeats cease; its eyes turn white because the lenses      freeze. And so the frog-cicle remains until the thaw, when      spring quite literally returns to its step.    </p>        <p>      <strong>A Hole in the Snow</strong>    </p>    <p>      Look for a small hole in the snow at the edge of a meadow.      Chances are its the exit or ventilation hole of a field      mouses tunnel. On unseasonably mild days, field mice might      emerge to forage for seeds or bark. But for most of the      winter, they live beneath the surface in the snug      snow-covered environment of thick grass, leaf litter and      crisscrossing tunnels that scientists term the subnivean      zone. Here, regardless of chilly winds and subfreezing air      in the harsh world above, temperatures seldom dip below 32      degrees.    </p>    <p>      Safe from owls and other predators, nourished by roots and      grass, and kept warm by the earth itself and an insulating      snowflake blanket, these rodents prosper in winter just as      well as they do in any season, with females sometimes      producing as many as five young per month. The females      among those babies, in turn, start producing litters of      their own one month later. This ongoing population      explosion produces a spring smorgasbord of bite-size      protein for foxes, coyotes, hawks, snakes and other      creatures, and fuels the reproductive cycles of those      creatures, ensuring the perpetuation of a healthy      ecosystem.    </p>    <p>      If you find a mouse hole in the snow, take note of its      location and come back in the spring. Part the grass, and      youll discover an elaborate maze of pathways pummeled      smooth by countless wee footsteps.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Some Gall!</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you venture across winter fields, watch for the tall,      dried stalks of goldenrod, one of North Americas most      widespread weeds. Chances are youll spy at least one stalk      with an odd round swelling about an inch in diameter: a      gall formed around an invading insect. Using a pocket      knife, carefully cut open one of the swellings. Inside,      youll discover a hard, pale worm, probably the larva of a      goldenrod gall fly.    </p>    <p>      In late spring and early summer, adult gall flies??which      are less than a quarter inch long, have clear black-banded      wings and prefer walking to flying??lay eggs on the tips of      emerging goldenrod stems. About 10 days later, the eggs      produce larvae that bore into the stems??usually one larva      per stem. The little worms chewing action and saliva      stimulate the growth of extra plant tissue around it,      creating a pithy, vegetative sphere that provides both      shelter and food. In autumn, before going into dormancy,      the larva burrows outward, preparing an exit tunnel that      stops just short of breaking through the galls surface.      Then the larva retreats back to the galls center, where it      remains until it pupates and turns into an adult fly the      following spring.    </p>    <p>      If you remove the larva and warm the immobile creature in      your hand for a minute or two, itll come out of its      cold-weather stupor and wiggle. No wonder winter anglers      like finding goldenrod galls: live bait! Downy woodpeckers      are fond of goldenrod galls, too, and use their tiny,      pointed bills to bore into the spheres to extract the      morsels inside.    </p>            <p>      <strong>Amazing Snowflakes</strong>    </p>    <p>      Look upward as snowflakes drift delicately from the sky. Go      ahead and stick out your tongue??can you catch one?    </p>    <p>      Aristotle had it almost right when he wrote, When a cloud      freezes, there is snow. A snow crystal is born when a water      droplet condenses and freezes around a bit of dust or ice      inside a cold cloud. The infant crystal, a few thousand      water molecules held by electrical charge in the shape of a      six-sided plate or disc, immediately begins to fall. Its      the start of a two- to six-mile tumble to earth, a journey      that may take some two hours and perhaps cover hundreds of      horizontal miles.    </p>    <p>      As the crystal tumbles, it grows by drawing trillions of      vapor molecules out of the air and onto its surface like a      magnet. The molecules flow across the crystal and freeze,      locking together in any of the myriad patterns that we      associate with snowflakes. But the atmosphere is a      turbulent place, and a snow crystal is a delicate wanderer.      With each small variation in air temperature, with each      flutter of wind, the crystal changes shape. A hexagonal      plate may sprout fernlike projections; a star may suddenly      lose its points. Or the crystal may collide with others and      shatter, seeding the air with particles around which more      snow forms.    </p>    <p>      But under most conditions the crystal??sweeping the air of      water molecules, growing larger and heavier??eventually      catches in a ball of other crystals, a snowflake. By      definition, a snowflake is not a single crystal, but two or      more stuck together. Finally, it floats gently to      earth??if, that is, its not snagged at the last second by a      snow-loving human with an upturned face and an outstretched      tongue.?    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        Go Easy on Winter’s Wildlife      </h3>      <p>        Winter’s open forests and frost-flattened meadows        make wildlife watching easier; tracks and trails are more        obvious, and animals have fewer places to hide. But        winter for the wildlife itself means a day-to-day        life-or-death struggle for survival. Food is scarce, and        temperatures are frigid. Sometimes, the stored energy        from a few tidbits gleaned during the day is all a        creature has to sustain it through the night.      </p>      <p>        Disturbing birds or animals unnecessarily, keeping close        on their heels by following fresh tracks, or otherwise        forcing creatures to run or leave places of shelter can        spell their doom. They’ll burn precious calories        and may end up exposed to deadly weather.      </p>      <p>        So go ahead, explore nature in winter and take advantage        of the season’s improved opportunities to observe        wild creatures. But go easy, too: Be quiet, keep your        distance and avoid frightening birds or animals that are        just trying to survive.      </p>			    </div>
