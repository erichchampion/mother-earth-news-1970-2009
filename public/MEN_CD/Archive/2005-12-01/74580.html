        <h5>From Dear Mother - Dec/Jan 2005</h5><p>I read your magazine on a regular basis, but I have never seen anything about electric bicycles. I commute on one manufactured by Optibike in Boulder, Colo., and have had tremendous luck with it. With your article this month on hybrids, I think you should cover the human/electric hybrids that truly are the future of transportation and that get the cost equivalent of 1,500 miles per gallon! My bike even came with a year’s worth of wind power included in the price. I do not even own a car since buying my bike! Help spread the word!</p><p> </p><h5>Cris Weaver<br />Boulder, Colorado</h5>
