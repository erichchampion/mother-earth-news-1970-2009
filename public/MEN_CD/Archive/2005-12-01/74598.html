        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>Our farm has been producing forage-finished beef for about 10 years, and I must say I have never come across an article on the subject that was so comprehensive, yet succinct as your “<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/Whole_Foods_and_Cooking/2005_October_and_November/Better_Beef" target="_blank">Better Beef</a>” article.</p><p>The health benefits of grass-fed beef are beyond question. It is absolutely true that the demand greatly exceeds the supply. We are already sold out (by prior deposit/reservation) for our February 2006 harvest. Your writer was on the ball to be talking to the folks at the <a href="http://www.stockmangrassfarmer.com/sgf/" target="_blank">Stockman Grassfarmer</a> newspaper. It is the bible of forage-finished meat producers; always timely and full of useful info.</p><p>There was only one shortcoming in the article: the mention of suitable breeds for grass-fed beef. Murray Grey cattle are exceptionally qualified to produce tender grass-fed beef. In addition, the Murrays are good mothers, extremely docile, good milkers and have few birth problems. As a bonus, the silver ones will shine in the moonlight! Kidding aside - I’m happy to provide more information to anyone about the Murray Grey breed of beef cattle.<br /></p><h5>Carole Brown<br />Beaver Creek Farms<br />Lawton, Oklahoma<br /><a href="http://www.murraygrey.com/" target="_blank">www.murraygrey.com</a></h5>
