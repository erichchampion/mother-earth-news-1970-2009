        <h3>From <i>Dear Mother</i> - Dec/Jan 2005</h3><p>I am writing this in response to the letter from Jonathan McElroy (“Dear Mother,” October/November 2005). I feel sorry for anyone who can say that nature has “no inherent value.” Our love and appreciation of nature and our Mother Earth are the things that make us human! I understand everyone is entitled to his or her own opinion, including that of “pro-human,” but human life could not exist without nature!</p><p>According to the teachings of Black Elk (Lakota leader), it sounds as if McElroy has the “Blue Man” mentality. This is a thought process that removes man from creation, when in truth we are a part of all beings upon this Earth, and they are a part of us.</p><p></p><p>Environmentalism is not dead! You would think that in the 21st century humans would realize that we are destroying our world at an alarming rate. We can no longer work against nature and hope to survive much longer. It is that kind of separatist thinking that will ultimately bring about our extinction!</p><h5>Richard Buie<br />Ravenna, Michigan</h5><p><br /></p>
