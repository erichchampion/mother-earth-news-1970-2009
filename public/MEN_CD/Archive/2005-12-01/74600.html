        <h5>From Dear Mother - Dec/Jan 2005</h5><p>People who buy hybrids now are investing in a less oil-dependent future, and generations to come will owe them a debt of gratitude. Hybrid power is obviously the propulsion system of the future, and I foresee a distant time when people will look at faded pictures of our petroleum-only vehicles and wonder how and why we managed to keep them in use for so long. The strong sales of hybrids is a good sign that at least some people are paying attention, and the emergence of promising developments such as hybrid plug-in technology is a very good thing for the world.</p><h5>Henry M. Bruce<br />Duchesne, Utah</h5>
