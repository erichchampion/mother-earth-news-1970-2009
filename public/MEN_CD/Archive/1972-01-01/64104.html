                    <p>      Dear MOTHER,    </p>    <p>      According to the Minnesota VOLUNTEER Magazine, there are      over one million acres of backtax land (wooded, not      waterfront) available in St. Louis County, Minnesota alone      . . . to say nothing of nearby Itasca, Cass and Aitkin      counties. This land usually sells for $5 to $15 an acre . .      . and for only a little more if it's covered with      marketable timber or adjoins a road.    </p>    <p>      To buy such acreage, you must make at least a 30% down      payment and pay 4% interest on the balance . . . but the      first taxes due on land purchased now would be 1972 taxes      (payable in 1973).<br />    </p>    <p>      For further details, contact the land commissioner in the      county that interests you most (he also has information on      private land for sale). An especially good man to get in      touch with, we found, is Land Commissioner William Marshall      in Grand Rapids (Itasca County), Minnesota.<br />      <br />      I haven't seen any of this land yet, but I'm on my      way.<br />    </p>    <p>      Susie Sandmann<br />      Sleepy Eye, Minn.<br />      Dear MOTHER,<br /> Here's some information on back tax sales (for      Pennsylvania, but probably more-or-less applicable for      other states, too) . . . which is still a good way to get      inexpensive land.<br />The counties in my state handle all these tax sales and      group them into two classes. The first is a "tax claim      sale" (usually held twice a year), which is an auction with      the minimum bid being the amount of back taxes due. The new      owner is responsible for all leins, assessments, mortgages      . . . in short, debts on the property. It's a good idea to      have a professional title search made on land bought at one      of these auctions.<br />      <br />      Acreage may also be purchased at what is called "judicial      sales". These auctions are also held twice a year and a      minimum bid of $1.00 is required. The properties offered      have no debts on them and are sold free and clear. A      do-it-yourself title search should be sufficient for one of      these farms.<br />      <br />      I've seen several 26-acre parcels go for around $80 and      larger tracts for $15 to $30 an acre at these sales. The      only problem is that the best of these properties are      sometimes unmapped, so you may not know exactly where they      are.    </p>    <p>      John S. Hileman, Jr.<br />      Harrisburg, Pa.    </p>
