                    <p>      Soap making is yet another down-home pursuit that allows      you to feel good inside because you get to recycle and      create at the same time. It's also an operation that can be      just as small-scale and simple or as large and      sophisticated as you want to make it . . . anything from      throwing ashes into the cookout frying pan to carefully      measuring rose geranium petals into a precisely controlled      batch of bar soap. Perhaps best of all, this homemade      cleaner contains none of the phosphates, NTA, still-caustic      sodas and other additives that made today's detergents so      dangerous to the environment. Real homemade soap is all      natural, all organic and as welcome on the homestead as a      compost pile.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GENERAL NOTES ON SOAPMAKING</strong>    </p>    <p>      1. Never use lye on aluminum utensils (it acts on them).      For small batches of soap, enameled or granite ware is      suitable . . . for larger batches, an iron kettle may be      used.    </p>    <p>      2. There need never be a failure in soapmaking. If      separation occurs, ingredients can be reclaimed.    </p>    <p>      3. Remember that <em>lard</em> is the melted and clarified      fat of swine and <em>tallow</em> the hard, coarse fat from      sheep or cows (usually from around the kidneys and loins).      Before tallow dries out, it's called <em>suet.      Rendering</em> fat is simply clarifying it by melting.    </p>    <p>      4. The following fats are listed in order of their      desirability for soapmaking: tallow, lard, their      combinations, olive oil, other vegetable oils. Mineral oils      will not make soap and poultry fat should be combined with      other fats since soap made from it alone is soft and      spongy.    </p>    <p>      5. To obtain soap with a clean wholesome odor, all grease      must be pure and clean.    </p>    <p>      6. Instead of storing rinds and meat scraps, extract the      fat and store it in a tightly covered container in a cool,      dry place.    </p>    <p>      7. Make the fat into soap as it accumulates and let the      soap age rather than allowing the fat to get too old and      rancid.    </p>    <p>      8. If you find that your grease has become rancid or      contains materials other than fats, boil it in a large      quantity of water, allow it to cool, skim off the grease      and then follow the directions in the recipe for      soapmaking.    </p>    <p>      9. Measure accurately and be careful about tempera tures.    </p>    <p>      10. The ammonia, kerosene, carbolic acid, etc. that some      people add to soap help it little, if any . . . they are      usually neutralized by the lye. Such ingredients DO      increase cost and may even make soap harsh on skin.    </p>    <p>      11. Coldness makes a hard, brittle soap.    </p>    <p>      12. Excess lye makes a coarse, flinty soap that will      crumble when shaved. Aged soap should have a smooth velvety      texture, should curl when shaved and should not bite the      tongue.    </p>    <p>      13. Aging always improves soap. Soap made from lard or soap      that has been boiled requires the longest aging before it      becomes hard and ready for use.    </p>    <p>      14. Use the following all-purpose soap as a toilet soap, as      a shampoo or as a laundry soap for prints, lingerie, hose      and other delicate fabrics.    </p>
