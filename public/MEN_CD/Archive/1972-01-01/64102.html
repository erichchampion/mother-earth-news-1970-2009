                   <h5 id="byline">by JOHN CUDDY</h5>    <p>      Well, we've muddled through our first year in the north      country. Mother Nature was good to us and gave us a mild      frost-free summer and a plentiful garden . . . but we still      have a lot to learn about the special problems of farming      and living where the winters get down to 50-below and even      July may bring a light frost. If you're still thinking      about making your great escape to the North, you may      appreciate a few tips that we've learned by doing.    </p>    <p>      Staying warm up here in the winter is hard enough . . .      don't complicate it by purchasing a big old rambling      farmhouse. There aren't many in this region for a good      reason . . . they're harder'n the dickens to heat when the      wind is blowing 60 miles an hour straight down from the      arctic. Most of the homes in our area tend to be low, flat      boxes which are well-sheltered by windbreaks to the north      and west. Whatever you buy, check the building's      insulation. It could mean the difference between spending      your winter chopping twice as much wood as you really need      . . . or sitting in a warm kitchen watching the snow pile      up outside.    </p>    <p>      Wet and unseasoned wood doesn't burn well and the resins      from green, pitchy logs can even accumulate in the chimney      and catch fire . . . so, if you're going to heat with wood,      plan on cutting the fuel at least six months before you      need it. You'll find it even better if you can stay a full      year ahead on this detail. If you haven't the time to      season your firewood the first year, cut dead wood for      immediate use. Figure on at least ten cords of oak,      tamarack pine, birch or other hardwood . . . or fifteen      cords of softwood.    </p>    <p>      Your livestock must have snug winter quarters and any      solid, draft-free building should do the trick. As long as      the animals get plenty of food, they'll generate their own      heat. Goats, in particular, need large amounts of roughage      with which to maintain this winter body heat and I solve      the problem by cutting a tree every week during the winter.      We then tote a goodly pile of trimmings into the barn for      goat munchies and let the main part of the tree cure into      fuel for next year's fires.    </p>    <p>      If you're planning to build on your northern homestead,      give some thought to attaching the barn to the house      Scandinavian-style. The stock will benefit from the house      heat that seeps into their quarters and you won't have to      walk so far to tend the animals on frigid winter mornings.    </p>    <p>      We've learned that water pipes here in northern Minnesota      will freeze unless buried at least three feet deep. Double      that if there's any traffic over the line (traffic packs      the ground and allows the frost to penetrate deeper). If      you don't care to dig six-foot-deep trenches for your      pipes, you can build a bridge of some kind (a bale of hay      or boards raised off the ground will do the job) over the      lines where traffic crosses.    </p>    <p>      Summers up here are short and therefore, most welcome.      Spring starts in April . . . but it may frost or snow after      the middle of May. June through the end of August is      <em>usually</em> frost-free and September brings frost and,      perhaps, light snow.    </p>    <p>      Cold weather crops like peas, cabbage, potatoes, broccoli,      lettuce, onions and turnips thrive and may be planted in      April before the last frost. Corn, tomatoes and other      vegetables which need a longer growing season do well nine      years out of ten, but that one year may see a hard freeze      in June or August . . . and there go the more delicate      crops if they're not protected. It pays to keep a large      supply of bushel baskets handy for covering plants and cold      frames-even a small greenhouse-would be a good      investment for anyone homesteading this far north.    </p>    <p>      Insect life practically explodes up here in the summer and      mosquitoes, deerflies and no-see-ums can be a great      nuisance. Commercial repellents, while fairly effective,      taste and smell awful and last only a short time. No wonder      the old-time. Indians and trappers used to coat themselves      with a thin; layer of pitch in the spring and avoid water      until the pests disappeared in the fall . . . the pitch      formed a horn-like coating; which the insects couldn't      penetrate.<br />    </p>    <p>      Mostly, my wife and I have just gotten used to the pests,      except in the evening when the mosquitoes are at their      worst Then we go to bed early, spend fifteen minutes      swatting the little devils that sneaked in under the      fiberglass netting with us . . . and enjoy the rest of the      night in peace and comfort.    </p>    <p>      The insects are offset by the stunning variety of wild      fruits and berries which abound here each year. In spring,      the countryside is washed in white and pink from the      chokeberry and wild plum blossoms and-by late      summer-the tree line, windbreaks and woods are full      of these fruits, wild raspberries, blueberries and rose      hips while wild rice crowds the shallows of the lakes.      There's so much volunteer fruit free for the picking in      fact, that planting your own is almost unnecessary.    </p>    <p>      We did put in a few apple trees, though, and-from      talking to the local people-learned that it's best      not to give an orchard too much protection. An open      northern or western exposure is best for the trees as it      will cause them to bloom later. Orchards placed in a      southern or eastern exposure-or otherwise given too much      protection-will blossom too early and may easily be      wiped out by late frost. Always buy local nursery stock,      too: imported plants may not be strong enough to make it      through the winter.    </p>    <p>      The deer, 'coon, fox, bears, wolves, occasional moose and      other wildlife in this region are nice to watch in the      evening . . . but they consider everything from asparagus      to zucchini as fair game and can prove to be pesky garden      raiders. The only foolproof method of cutting your losses      to these critters strange as it may seem, was taught to me      by a dog.    </p>    <p>      Dogs, you know, mark their territory by peeing around its      edges . . . as do many other animals. If you use the same      technique along the boundaries of your garden, deer and      most other warm-blooded creatures will heed the warning and      stay out.    </p>
