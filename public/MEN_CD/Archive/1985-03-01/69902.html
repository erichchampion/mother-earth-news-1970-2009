                <p>      <em>You can get more from your garden now and later      (perhaps even during the winter months).</em>    </p>        <h2 id="subtitle">Six Ways to Make Them</h2>    <h5 id="byline">      by Norm Lee    </h5>    <p>      My wife, Sherrie, and I first built raised beds as a rather      desperate means of dealing with a garden site that offered      only rocky, dead, chemically abused soil. There was little      literature on the subject that we knew of, but we did      remember reading that the Chinese have been planting in      loosened mounds of earth for <em>40</em> <em>cen</em>      <em>turies.</em>    </p>    <p>      Much to our surprise and excitement, the beds of composted      clay soil that we prepared and planted that spring soon      produced an abundance of healthy and delicious vegeta bles.      Visitors ran for their cameras as soon as they saw our      attractive jungle. We won dered how we could have gardened      for years without discovering that with a bit of effort we      could have doubled, tripled, and quadrupled our yields      while halving, thirding, and quartering our garden work.    </p>    <p>      We saw, too, that we no longer needed to buy or hire a      plow, or drag a cultivator, a tiller, or even a common      <em>hoe.</em> To dig in raised beds, we needed only four      tools: a fork, a rake, a shovel, and a hand trowel-all      inexpensive.    </p>    <h3>      THE CAUTIOUS APPROACH    </h3>    <p>      If you're not ready to commit yourself to raised-bed      gardening without some evidence that it works, try the      following experiment: Mark out one or two plots in your      garden (make them about 4' X 8' or 4' X 12') and-      using a four-tined garden fork or an iron bar -      loosen the soil as deeply as you can drive in the tool.      Once that is done, don't step on the loosened soil, or      you'll undo some of the good that your hard work      accomplished - namely, aerating the soil to overcome      the heavy compactness that discourages plant growth. The      loosened soil's increased capacity to hold oxygen and water      should result in plants that are noticeably bigger,      healthier, and more productive.    </p>    <p>      The worked beds will likely be a few inches higher than the      surrounding compacted soil, but they may not be high enough      to warrant borders of planks or logs. Then again, you might      want to outline them anyway, if only to remind yourself to      avoid stepping inside the beds.    </p>    <p>      Mulch these areas with compost, to add more nutrients and a      bit more height. Then go ahead and plant <em>intensively. .      . that</em> is, sow the seeds just far enough apart so that      when the plants are adult size, their leaves will just      barely touch those of their neighbors. This will provide a      <em>shade mulch</em> that helps to keep down weeds.    </p>    <h3>      THE QUICK FIX    </h3>    <p>      We developed a shortcut route to raisedbed gardening when      moving our homestead to new acreage one May. What with all      the work of transferring our belongings, there wasn't time      to spare for digging beds before planting. So we brought a      couple of dumptruck loads of compost from our former home's      huge pile and unloaded them at the new garden's location.      Then we shoveled and raked the material into 24'-long      mounds, lined them with old railroad ties to keep the loam      in place, and planted.    </p>    <p>      The new beds didn't have the depth of compost - and      therefore the level of production - that our former      plot had enjoyed, but the method did allow us to harvest      yields larger and heavier than the conventionally grown      gardens around us. When we have the time, we'll dig down      and fill the bed with compost and organic materials as      described later in this article, but the shortcut method      has proven to be an effective way to get going on raised      beds without a whole lot of work, and to quickly produce a      more attractive, more productive, and more easily cared for      garden. (Even when using the quick fix method, it's a good      idea to loosen the soil in the area where the bed is going      to be built. As noted above, you can do this easily by      pushing or driving an iron bar or four-tine fork into the      top 10 or 12 inches of the soil and breaking it up.)    </p>    <p>      We learned a couple of lessons while preparing this      (almost) instant garden, too. The first dump-truck load was      simply dropped at the approximate site of the bed-to-be; we      then had to shovel the soil into its proper place. That      taught us two things: [1] to position the railroad ties (or      build the bed frame of treated lumber) <em>before</em>      bringing in the topsoil, and [2] to take care that the      truck puts the earth where we want it in the <em>first</em>      place, thus minimizing the heavy handwork.    </p>    <h3>      THE TRENCH 'N' MOUND PROCEDURE    </h3>    <p>      If your garden is in a well-drained location, beds can be      created by digging the topsoil out of the pathway areas      - say, to a depth of six to ten inches - and      adding it to the planting areas. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: This      technique works very well in freshly rototilled      plots.]</em> This will double the depth of topsoil      available to plant in, making good use of what otherwise      would only be trod upon.    </p>    <p>      As I noted before, we like to use railroad ties to keep the      soil from falling into the trenches. Be sure to use      <em>old</em> ones, though, since the newly creosoted      timbers can be toxic to plants and people. Used ties are      free around here (when we can find them) and are heavy      enough to hold the beds in place without being staked. Be      sure not to undermine them when digging the path-trenches,      however, or your wooden borders will fall into the dugout      area. And, once again, if you loosen the soil within the      bed with a fork or iron bar before digging the paths, the      plants' roots will have easier access to the needed      nutrients.    </p>    <p>      Finished compost can be mixed with the extra soil, if      available. If not, you can simply <em>sheet-compost</em> by      adding organic materials such as grass clippings, kitchen      garbage, wood ashes, sawdust, leaves, and rotted manure to      the bed areas before covering them with the new earth.      We're careful to hand-pick all rocks out of the bed so the      plants' roots won't have those obstacles to deal with, and      to remove any roots - especially grass roots -      that are likely to continue growing and choke our crops. We      find that every bit of care taken in <em>preparing</em>      raised-bed soil pays off very handsomely. Once your soil is      in good shape, you'll have eliminated a great many of the      problems usually associated with gardening.    </p>    <h3>      THE DOUBLE-DIGGING SYSTEM    </h3>    <p>      For this method, mark out a rectangle - in a      convenient spot in your row garden - that's 3' to 4'      wide and 6' to 12' long. Now dig a 1' -deep trench across      one end of this space and wheelbarrow the soil to the other      end of the planned bed. (You'll later use this to fill the      last trench you dig.) Now, again with an iron bar or      four-tined fork, loosen the soil in the bottom of the      trench as deeply as possible.    </p>    <p>      With that done, fill the pit with kitchen garbage, moldy      hay, leaves, grass clippings, manure, or anything else      compostable. Then dig an adjacent trench to the same depth,      mounding the removed topsoil on the organic material in the      first trench. When you finish digging the second trench,      plunge the iron bar or fork along the bottom to break up      the subsoil.    </p>    <p>      Again, fill the second trench with organic material, dig      another trench, and place the topsoil over the      to-be-composted matter. Continue this process until the bed      is completed. Cover the last compost-filled trench with the      extra soil from the wheelbarrow, then line the bed with      boards, rocks, or logs, or simply leave it mounded.    </p>    <h3>      THE DEEP-COMPOST METHOD    </h3>    <p>      When we learned that a tomato plant's roots will reach five      feet into the earth if not blocked by hardpan, that lettuce      roots can plunge as deep as eight feet, and that beet roots      may descend to <em>ten</em> feet, we decided to dig our      beds two feet deep, at least, and then pile the mound at      least one foot above ground. That gives the roots a minimum      of three feet in which they can easily reach the nutrients      necessary to build healthy plants. It happens we had a      backhoe on hand to do the digging with the first year. But      knowing what we know now, we'd <em>hire</em> one if we had      to. It's well worth the expense, considering the better      food, the reduction in pest and disease problems, and the      enormous yields that result from the extra-deep beds.    </p>    <p>      After the beds are dug, we fill each 24'-long, 3'-wide plot      with organic matter and allow it to slowly decompose over      the months and years. Once filled, the beds are raked to      prepare a seedbed. The mounds shouldn't be <em>crowned</em>      (rounded over), as that can cause water runoff and erosion.      Instead, flatten the top to hold the rainwater, smooth the      surface carefully, and put in the seeds and seedlings.    </p>    <p>      Here - in detail - is how we fill the      deepcompost trenches: On the bottom of the excavation we      place approximately 6 inches of unshredded brush and      prunings, which will trap air for the plants' roots for      years to come. Covering that is half a foot (at least) of      old hay and weeds that we've gathered and piled up for just      this purpose. It doesn't matter if the material is dry or      green, since it's being buried so deeply. Then a 6-inch      layer of subsoil (all rocks removed) is added, to make sure      all the trace elements are included, followed by 3 or more      inches of manure. (We find it's OK to use the material      fresh at this depth.) After every layer is applied, by the      way, we add a sprinkling of rich topsoil and manure to help      trigger bacterial action.    </p>    <p>      Next comes a 3-inch layer of a mixture of whatever we have      an abundance of: leaves, kitchen garbage, grass clippings,      wood ashes, pine needles, sawdust, or just about      <em>anything</em> organic. With this step completed, the      bed is filled to ground level.    </p>    <p>      Then a 6-inch cover of wet, spoiled hay is applied, topped      by a 3-inch layer of wellcooked compost and, finally, 3      inches of good topsoil to cover it all. The finished bed is      ready to rake level on top and plant.    </p>    <h3>      THE FOUR-SEASON RAISED BED    </h3>    <p>      For six years now we've gardened right through the winter      by covering our deepcompost beds with a foot of hay and a      sheet of plastic (as reported in MOTHER N0. 73, page 66).      Normally, the added insulation that snow provides keeps      frost from reaching the plants' roots during the      December-to-March cold season here in upstate New York      (USDA Zone 5). This past winter's unusual condi tions upped      the ante for local year-round gardeners, however. Usually      there's pretty constant snow cover, and the temperature      dips below zero only rarely. However, last year the ground      was often bare, and the thermometer hovered between 20°      and -20°F day and night for much of December, freezing      our 3-foot-deep water line on Christmas Day. While the      garden beds (carrots, beets, turnips, cole crops, chard,      spinach, etc.) were protected on top with a foot of hay,      the frost froze the moist earth in the wide paths between      the beds, attacking the roots from below.    </p>    <p>      We plan to avoid a recurrence of that problem by lining our      new beds with plastic-foam insulation before filling them      with the compost materials. Insulation that's two inches      thick will provide sufficient protection, we think, even in      USDA Zones 5 or above, if it extends at least two feet      deep. If the temperature stays near zero for several days      with bare-ground conditions, we'll also pile hay in the      paths to hold back the frost.    </p>    <p>      The insulation could be used to cover the top of the beds,      and may be no more expensive than hay or plastic in some      areas where the former costs $8.00 or more per bale. The      bed caps shown in the illustration are designed for short      crops only. We'll continue using dry hay and plastic for      members of the cabbage family.    </p>    <p>      I'm confident that anyone with a few square feet of garden      space, no matter how poor the soil, can raise more than      $2.00 worth of food on each of those square feet each year      if they prepare raised beds similar to those described      here. In fact, conventional gardeners would be well-advised      to <em>reduce</em> their garden area when converting to the      deep-compost method, unless they plan to feed the neighbors      or start a roadside stand!    </p>    		<p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: An earlier version of this article      appeared in</em> Homesteaders News. <em>Subscriptions to      that publication are available for $10 (6 issues) from Norm      and Sherrie Lee, Box 517, Naples, NY 14512.</em>    </p>    <p>      For a review of our own gardeners' experiences with      raised-bed gardening, see page 56.    </p>
