                <p>      <em>If you happen to be tight on space and cash, this $20      (or less) project might be just the ticket.</em>    </p>                <p>      Cozy living quarters are great for conserving heat and rent      money, but a shortage of storage space can sure put a cramp      in an active person's lifestyle. For example, just the      thought of <em>using-and finding</em> an      out-of-the-way place to stash-such a basic necessity as an      ironing board in tight digs is enough to send some folks to      the cleaners. Well, if this scenario sounds all too      familiar, you might be interested in putting together our      inexpensive and splendidly practical high-back valet chair      that unfolds to become-you guessed it-a compact      ironing board!    </p>    <p>      Laugh if you wish, but this humble pine seat asks little in      the way of space while providing two coat pegs, shoe      storage, and underside accommodations for cuff links, tie      clips, and the like. And when the heat's on, the hinged      bottom and back can be locked horizontally to take care of      any "pressing engagements." Furthermore, the denim      upholstery fabric <em>-</em> backed with cotton      batting <em>-</em> is tough enough to serve well in      either capacity.    </p>    <p>      MOM's hybrid high-back is constructed, for the most part,      of softwood shelving, though you'll notice that we did use      some 1/4" hardboard and assorted hinges and fasteners to      complete the project. Our annotated illustration describes      each component's dimensions, but if you don't have a      collection of one-by scraps to rely upon, rest assured that      all the pine pieces can be trimmed from a single 12-foot      length of 1 X 12.    </p>    <p>      Probably the best way to approach this project is to size      all the parts first and then fasten them together as shown.      A crosscut, a ripsaw, and a coping blade will handle the      cutting chores, though a circular saw with a combination      blade would make things a whole lot simpler. You'll also      need a small wood chisel and a hammer to provide recesses      for the flush joint hinges, and a drill with 1/16", 1/8",      and 1/4" bits to bore the necessary fastener holes. A 1 "      hole saw, as well, would make short work of the half-dozen      openings in the 3"X 22-1/4" table support . . . and a few      carefully executed strokes with a handsaw should take care      of the dadoes that secure the drawer ends.    </p>    <p>      For safety's sake, trial-fit the matching leg parts      together first, then use a good yellow carpenter's glue at      the joining surfaces in addition to the screws and nails      called for. When assembling the ironing table, be certain      the 1-3/4" X 2" pivot ears <em>and</em> their central holes      are positioned so the chair back lifts without binding.      Then take extra care with the joint stops to assure that      the two-part pressing platform is straight. (The same      attention should be given the 3" X 22-1/4" table support to      guarantee a <em>level</em> working surface.)    </p>    <p>      The finishing touches are a matter of taste, but we simply      sanded the boards and dressed them with polyurethane, then      fitted the batting and denim cover to the extended platform      . . . trimmed the material to match the wooden pattern . .      . stitched the binding around the exposed borders . . . and      stapled the cloth to the boards' rounded edges (you may      wish to use upholstery tacks instead). The result, we      think, is rather pleasant to look at . . . and goes a long      way toward making space where there seems to be little.    </p>
