                    <h5 id="byline">     by Tom Ferguson, M.D.    </h5>    <p><strong>      Is it possible. that a dog leaping and barking with joy      when you return home, a cat curled and purring in your lap,      or a fish swimming peacefully in a tank can reduce your      blood pressure, alter the course of heart disease, and      decrease your stress level? Recent studies suggest they can      do this and more. "I believe the day is coming when doctors      will sometimes `prescribe' pets instead of pills," says Dr.      Leo Bustad, dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine at      Washington State University. "What pill gives so much love,      makes its owner feel safe, stimulates laughter, encourages      regular exercise, and makes a person feel needed?"</strong>    </p>    <h3>      Pets and Heart Disease    </h3>    <p>      When University of Pennsylvania researchers studied a group      of seriously ill heart patients, they found that the pet      owners had much better survival records. In the year the      study lasted, the death rate for patients who did not own      pets was 28%. Pet owners had a death rate of less than 6%    </p>    <p>      Another study looked at the effects of pets on older      people. A British psychologist gave a parakeet to each      person in a group of senior citizens. Members of the      control group each got a begonia. After five months there      was a noticeable increase in health and morale among the      pet owners. Swedish researchers found that 15% of the      elderly persons studied considered their pets to be their      most significant social contact.    </p>    <p>      Other health effects have also been documented: Petting the      soft fur of a dog or cat can profoundly lower blood      pressure. Watching fish in a tank is for many people as      effective a way of relaxing mind and body as any      tranquilizer or meditative technique.    </p>    <p>      A number of studies suggest that people who own pets are      generally in better health than those who do not. These      positive effects seem to hold for every kind of pet studied      so far, including-but not limited to-dogs,      cats, gerbils, parakeets, chickens, fish, mice, rabbits,      and iguanas.    </p>    <p>      The researchers who performed the study of heart disease      patients mentioned above concluded that having a pet      decreased a person's risk of dying by about 3% per year.      This would put owning a pet in roughly the same category as      other health-promoting behaviors such as eating a healthy      diet, exercising regularly, managing stress, not smoking,      being in a committed-couple relationship, and having close      ties with family and friends.    </p>    <p>      Among other benefits, our pets provide us with an intimate      bond with another living being. Such bonds-like the      intimacy of close human relationships-seem to produce      a kind of antistress armor that protects us from the      pressures that might otherwise predispose us to illness.    </p>    <h3>      Pets as Family    </h3>        <p>      University of Maryland researcher Dr. Ann Cain found that      87% of pet owners thought of their pets as members of the      family; 81% felt that pets tuned in to their feelings; and      38% celebrated their pet's birthday.<br />      Pets can help bring families together by promoting      interaction among family members, by relieving the stress      of simply <em>being</em> a busy parent or a growing child,      and by helping children learn the importance of      responsibility and discipline.    </p>    <p>      Even a pet's death can serve to bring family members closer      together. "Shared feelings of grief can form a strong      family bond," says Dr. Michael Fox, scientific director of      the Humane Society of the United States, "uniting children      and parents in love and respect." Many older people feel a      need for more love and affection. "Companion animals may be      a significant source of warmth, affection, love, and      devotion," Dr. Bustad writes. "In some cases animals are      the <em>only</em> source. In many cases, a pet becomes a      person's reason for living."</p>      <h3>Pets as Therapists    </h3>        <p>      Animals can often help those who can no longer be helped by      other people; in particular, pets can help people who feel      withdrawn, depressed, or hopeless. Emotionally disturbed      children who refuse to interact with human therapists will      frequently become very involved with a dog and may even      confide in it. Once the child and the dog have begun to      play, the therapist may be able to join in. Child and      therapist may later go on to form a direct relationship.    </p>    <h3>      Pets and Stress    </h3>    <p>      The dog who greets us at home or the cat who chases a bit      of string or hides in an empty paper bag provides us with      an invitation to laugh, relax, and enjoy ourselves. The      blood pressures of hypertensive patients have dropped      considerably while watching tropical fish. Looking at fish      tanks has also helped anxious patients relax before oral      surgery.    </p>    <p>      Nursing homes have discovered the therapeutic value of      bringing pets to residents. Pet adoption and pet visitation      programs are now under way in cities across the country.      Call your local Humane Society or Society for the      Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (SPCA) for information on      local programs.    </p>    <h3>      Someone to Care For    </h3>    <p>      The task of caring for a pet is often a child's first      serious responsibility. Throughout our lives, our pets pull      us back into the daily rounds of the natural world with      their needs for continuing care.    </p>    <p>      Feeding the cat, bathing the dog, tending the fish tank,      taking the parakeet on your finger-these little acts of      caring assure the care giver that he or she is truly      needed. Such feelings can at times serve as a true      lifeline.    </p>    <p>      The child who once fed the dog may many years later have      little strength or opportunity to help another human being.      But he or she can still continue the life-giving rituals of      caring by tending a goldfish in a bowl, providing a saucer      of milk for a stray cat, or putting out crumbs for the      winter birds.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, all of us-young <em>and</em> old-benefit      immeasurably from the companionship and love pets give us .      . . and allow us to give in return.<br />      <br />      EDITOR'S NOTE: Medical Self-Care, Dr. Tom Ferguson's      quarterly journal, is available for $15 per year from      Medical Self-Care, P.O.
