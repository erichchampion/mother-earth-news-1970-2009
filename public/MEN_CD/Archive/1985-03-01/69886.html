                <p>     <strong>Economic Outlook</strong>    </p>       <p>      <em>On February 18, 1982, President Reagan announced the      formation</em> <em>of</em> <em>the Private Sector Survey on      Cost Control, to be chaired by entrepreneur</em> <em>J</em>      . <em>Peter Grace. The commission was to attempt to      scrutinize government spending through the eyes</em>      <em>of</em> <em>private-sector business . . . in effect, to      study the government as if it were a firm with which      commission members were considering merger. The Grace      Commission (as it came to be known) worked on its study for      about 18 months and turned in a comprehensive report      consisting</em> <em>of</em> <em>47 volumes that document      nearly 2,500 specific recommendations. It has been      estimated that, if implemented, the actions proposed by the      commission would result in a reduction in the federal      deficit</em> <em>of</em> <em>424</em> billion <em>dollars      over a three-year period and would do so, in the      commission's words, without "weakening America's needed      defense build-up, and without in any way harming necessary      social welfare programs. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And that may well be the case, but precious few</em>      <em>of us</em> <em>"little guys" are likely to be willing      or able to wade through 36 major reports and 11 special      subject studies to find out! That's why we were glad to see      that William R. Kennedy Jr. and Robert W. Lee have      summarized that monumental publication in an easy-to-read      160-page paperback (available for $2.95 postpaid from      Western Monetary Consultants, P.O. Box 430, Ft. Collins, CO      80522; 800/525-4956). The following excerpt from the first      chapter</em> <em>of</em> <em>that booklet, which      encapsulates a few</em> <em>of</em> <em>the commission's      recommendations, can serve as a sample</em> <em>of</em>      <em>what Kennedy and Lee have to offer . . . and      provide</em> examples <em>of</em> <em>the sort</em>      <em>of</em> <em>governmental waste that's at the heart</em>      <em>of</em> <em>the federal deficit now threatening to      strangle the economic futures</em> <em>of</em> <em>our      children and grandchildren. None</em> <em>of us</em>      <em>are likely to agree with</em> all <em>of</em> <em>the      proposals made by the Grace Commission, but most</em>      <em>of us</em> <em>would agree that</em> some <em>of</em>      <em>these recommendations could go a long way toward      restoring a little much-needed sanity to the American      economy.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Foreign Loan Subsidies</strong>      <strong><em>(Potential Savings: $360      million).</em></strong> The Grace Commission discovered      that taxpayers are subsidizing foreign borrowers. Interest      rates in 1970 on Official Development Assistance (O.D.A.)      loans, for instance, were 69 percent of the Treasury bond      rate (the price at which the federal government borrows      money). But by 1981, that foreign rate had plummeted even      further, to a mere 27 percent of the T-bond rate. Which      means, in the Commission's words, that "foreign borrowers      were getting loans from American taxpayers at <em>2.5      percent."</em> If the foreign rate could once again be      raised to at least the 1970 average of 69 percent,      taxpayers would realize a savings of $360 million-an      amount equal to the federal income taxes paid by 162,308      median-income families in 1983.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Parole Review</strong> <strong><em>(Potential      Savings: $256,200 per year).</em></strong> A prisoner who      appeals an unfavorable parole decision is presently      entitled to a two-step review of the decision. Incredibly,      the same official who initially ruled on the appeal is also      assigned to conduct the second review. In the eyes of the      Grace Commission, this would make the first examination      entirely redundant. Scrapping it would save an estimated      $256,200 annually. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: If the two-step      review is</em> not <em>abandoned, it should certainly be      conducted by two different officials!]</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Abuse of Legal Services</strong>      <strong><em>(Potential Savings: in the      millions).</em></strong> The Criminal Justice Act      authorizes free legal representation for defendants unable      to pay the costs themselves. For 1981, the bill was $28      million. A judge's decision regarding a defendant's      eligibility is based primarily on the (usually unverified)      financial information which the latter supplies the court.      One "unemployed" recipient of free legal counsel cited by      the Grace Commission "turned out to own $4,000 . . . in      traveler's checks, two race horses, a pair of Mercedes and      a motor home." It is difficult to know the full extent of      this sort of taxpayer-funded rip-off, but it undoubtedly      runs into the millions of dollars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACTION Agency Staffing</strong>      <strong><em>(Potential Savings: $26.7 million over three      years).</em></strong> The independent ACTION agency is the      federal government's umbrella organization for sundry      domestic volunteer activities. It was designed to advocate,      promote, and support the voluntary efforts of citizens and      organizations working to help alleviate problems      confronting the poor, the disabled, the elderly, and youth      with special needs. In the fall of 1981, ACTION carried      through a 20 percent reduction-in-force (R.I.F.),      eliminating 187 of its own employees from a total of 996.      In 1982, when the Peace Corps was removed from the ACTION      umbrella and made a separate entity, the ACTION staff fell      by another 258 persons. Even so, the Grace Commission      concluded that the agency is still heavily overstaffed and      recommends that its roster be trimmed from 603 to 358      full-time and temporary workers. Although the cutbacks      would entail significant percentage reductions in many      areas, the Commission "firmly believes they can be      accomplished without jeopardizing the agency's ability to      fulfill its mission and carry out its programs      effectively." Reduction of the ACTION staff as proposed      would save $26.7 million over three years.    </p>    <p>      Parenthetically, in Fiscal Year 1983, ACTION incurred      nearly $26 million in administrative costs while disbursing      $92 million in grants. That is a 22- cents-per-dollar      administration expense-sharply higher than the      12- cents-per-dollar for administration spent by the      private-sector United Way.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Annual Leave</strong> <strong><em>(Potential      Savings: $3.8 billion over three years).</em></strong> The      average private-sector worker accumulates four days of      vacation after six months on the job. In contrast, a      federal government worker earns 6.5 days after six months,      or 62.5 percent more than the private-sector worker.      Adjusting federal vacation policy to fit the pattern in the      private sector would save taxpayers $3.8 billion over three      years.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Consolidating Air Traffic Control Centers</strong>      <strong><em>(Potential Savings: $418.4 million over three      years).</em></strong> There are presently 22 Air Route      Traffic Control Centers (A.R.T.C.C.s) located throughout      the nine Federal Aviation Agency (F.A.A.) regions. The 350      employees at the centers are mostly teams of air traffic      controllers, and regulate traffic within specified      geographic boundaries. Based on its review, the Grace      Commission concluded that the number of A.R.T.C.C.s "can be      reduced to no more than 15 using available technology and      equipment." The change would reduce administrative and      supervisory staffing by 60 people per center, while      increasing operational staffing by 250 to 300 persons. The      consolidated facilities would provide the <em>same level of      air traffic control service and safety</em> and, over three      years, would result in savings of $418.4 million.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Closing Air Traffic Control Towers</strong>      <strong><em>(Potential Savings: $59.9 million over three      years).</em></strong> The Federal Aviation Administration      owns and operates 440 control towers at airports throughout      the nation. The Grace Commission suggests that "it is      feasible to close towers at many existing locations," since      57 towers have for three consecutive years fallen below      F.A.A. retention criteria. The Commission notes that 3,208      of the nation's 3,648 landing areas do not have airport      towers. And, 220 of those towerless air fields have      scheduled air carrier service, including jets. "Yet," the      Commission observes, "over 20,000 events occur per week at      these airports, which nevertheless maintain an outstanding      safety record and . . . [handle] other essential air      services, such as weather observation . . . ."    </p>    <p>      Prior to the 1981 air controllers' strike, 184 towers      operated 24 hours a day. At present,. 87 operate 24 hours a      day, while 97 get by on reduced hours. Also, some towers      have been "defederalized" as communities have taken      control, with no evidence of impaired      effectiveness-and with lower costs.    </p>    <p>      Closing the 57 below-standard towers could save $45.4      million over three years. And, reducing operating hours of      the 50 or 60 towers deemed by the F.A.A. to merit      permanently reduced hours would increase the savings by      another $14.5 million.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Cargo Preference</strong> <em><strong>(Potential      Savings: $15.6 million).</strong></em> Federal law      presently requires that at least 50 percent of the      agricultural commodities sold or donated to needy countries      by the United States under the "Food for Peace" program      must be shipped on U.S.-flag vessels. During Fiscal Year      1981, $250 million was spent on the transport of such      commodities. The Grace Commission calculates that      eliminating the cargo preference requirement would have      saved as much as $15.6 million, by permitting the      substitution of foreign flagships for U.S. flagships and      the consolidation of liner shipments on cheaper      foreign-flag tramps, which are irregularly scheduled ships      transporting cargo wherever contracted to do so.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Paper Shuffling</strong> <em><strong>(Potential      Savings: $7.1 million).</strong></em> Big corporations can      usually respond to correspondence within five days or so,      even when the volume of mail is large. Not so in the      federal government. Based on a sample of correspondence      arriving at the office of the Secretary of Health and Human      Services, the Grace Commission reports that "21 people . .      . handle the drafting and clearance of a      secretary-signature response" and, if you also include      "typists, messengers, and other clerical support      personnel," then the "actual H.H.S. number would increase      to between 55 and 60." Sixty people to answer one letter!      The Commission found the H.H.S. review process to be      repetitive as well as inefficient, while the clearance      process is "redundant, cumbersome, and time consuming." The      "extensive time required and the complicated process      involved in completing responses to letters received by the      O.S. [Office of the Secretary] is symptomatic of H.H.S.'s      organizational layering duplication problem. The numerous      levels of review, the multiple clearances, and the delays      in processing [47 days is the average], all indicate too      many people with similar responsibilities performing the      same function." If the handling of correspondence at H.H.S.      could be brought to the level of most other federal      agencies and departments, the three-year savings to      taxpayers could total $7.1 million.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Disaster Relief</strong> <em><strong>(Potential      Savings: in the billions).</strong></em> Congress usually      funds federal disaster relief programs <em>in advance,</em>      with annual lumpsum appropriations going to agency disaster      accounts. Such advanced funding does <em>not</em> earmark      money for a specific disaster, so agencies may allocate the      funds at their own discretion. In 1980, Congress reacted to      the Mount St. Helens disaster in Washington state with a      $946 million relief appropriation. But, as summarized by      the Grace Commission: "Due to the phrasing of the      regulation . . . the money could be used in other areas. In      fact, <em>only $386 million of the $946 million (41      percent) was spent on the Mount St. Helens disaster.</em>      The balance of $560 million was spent on other disasters      and could not be traced because it `lost its identity.' "      [Emphasis added.]    </p>    <p>      <strong>Conserving Energy in Hospitals</strong>      <strong><em>(Po</em></strong> <em><strong>tential Savings:      up to $55 million a year).</strong></em> The Grace      Commission referred to a General Accounting Office study      revealing that privatesector hospitals used more than twice      the number of conservation measures as are used in      government facilities. "If federal hospitals were brought      up to the standards of their counterparts in the private      sector," the Commission asserts, "an estimated $16 million      to $55 million could be saved each year in excessive energy      costs."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Glut in Energy Department Management</strong>      <em><strong>(Potential Savings: $19 million over three      years)</strong> .</em> The Department of Energy (D.O.E.)      has twice the number of supervisors per employee as does      the federal government as a whole (one for every three      employees compared to one for seven government-wide). If      that D.O.E. figure could be brought into line with the rest      of the government, at least 120 unnecessary supervisory and      management positions could be scrapped, resulting in a      three-year savings of $19 million.    </p>    <p>      ***    </p>    <p>      <strong>Block Grants by Fish and Wildlife Service      <em>(Potential Savings: $9.6 million over three years)</em>      .</strong> Adoption of a block-grant program of aid to the      states by the Fish and Wildlife Service could save      approximately $9.6 million over three years. Under the law,      such savings would be passed along to the states. With a      block grant, regional office staffs could be permanently      reduced by about 150 people.    </p>    <p>      ***    </p>    <p>      <strong>Freight Discounts <em>(Potential Savings: $530      million over three years).</em></strong> The government      presently spends $4.6 billion annually on freight, but does      not negotiate volume discounts with suppliers. The reason?      There is a serious lack of centralized freight information      from the various federal agencies. The Grace Commission      asserts that an "automated freight management system would      save taxpayers $530 million over three years."    </p>    <p>      <strong>Job Overgrading and Misclassification (Potential      Savings: $682 million a year).</strong> Under the      Government Service (G.S.) personnel classification system      for the Washington, D.C. area, perhaps one-third of all      positions are overgraded and nearly onehalf, according to      the Grace Commission, are misclassified with the wrong      grade, occupation or title. Correcting the errors would      save taxpayers $682 million annually.    </p>    <p>      ***    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rate Inconsistency.</strong> The inconsistency of      rate schedules among various federal agencies often leads      one agency to pay far more for an identical service or      commodity than another. The Commission cites an example      where the "Environmental Protection Agency paid      substantially more than the U.S. Coast Guard for the same      services provided by the same contractor." The inflated      charge, the Commission concluded, "was due largely to the      different billing standards used by EPA and the Coast      Guard. For example, the Coast Guard will pay $100 <em>per      week</em> for the use of an office trailer. The EPA's      schedule allows for $100 <em>per day."</em>    </p><hr />    <p>      Excerpted from A Taxpayer Survey of the Grace Commission      Report, by William R. Kennedy Jr. and Robert W.
