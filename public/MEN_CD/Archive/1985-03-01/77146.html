With the first bite, though,      I, half my front tooth sailed out of my mouth and came to      rest somewhere near the gravy tray, leaving me with a      broken stub and the thought of greeting my new congregation      looking like a "Hee Haw" character. I quickly made the      acquaintance of the town dentist.<br />      <br />      As I sat having a temporary tooth affixed and discussing      plans for the root canal work to come, I wondered where I'd      ever get the money to pay him. Then I noticed his office      walls were covered with wildlife prints, many of which      reminded me of duck hunting in my native southwestern      Ontario. Since I also love to <em>paint</em> ducks, the      word "barter" came to mind. And after looking at some of my      works, the dentist agreed to a swap. He got an original      duck scene in oils, my new congregation got a fulltoothed      sermon, and I got hooked on bartering and have kept at it      ever since!    </p>    <p>      L.D.<br />      West Virginia    </p>        <p>      Young homesteaders aren't the only ones who barter. At a      meeting of our weekly senior citizens' group, I noticed one      of the ladies in the sewing group was using a pair of      scissors that were not only quite dull, but also loose in      the pivot joint. Since sharpening tools is one of my      specialties, I offered to take those scissors home and work      on them for her.    </p>    <p>      When I returned them, sharp and tight, at the following      week's gathering, I offered the same service to others      there . . . and was quickly given more scissors in need of      sharpening or minor repairs. I made it clear, though, that      I wouldn't take money for this work. So instead the ladies      paid me by making me scarves, mittens, and other homemade      items. What started out as a friendly gesture turned into a      terrific barter! And now one of those nice ladies has      invited me to her house for a homecooked, meal ....    </p>    <p>      M.B.<br />      California    </p>    <p>      Four years ago my wife and I moved from a one-bedroom town      house in the city to a three-bedroom log home that we built      ourselves. Because most of our money had been spent on the      house and four acres, there wasn't much left for furnishing      our new home.    </p>    <p>      We met a man in town who owns a furniture stripping and      refinishing shop and fell in love with the antique oak      pieces he had for sale-but the prices were out of our      reach. Then we started going to local auctions and farm      sales and found the kind of furniture we wanted, at      affordable prices-but most of it was in need of      repair and refinishing.    </p>        <p>      So I made a deal with the man at the strip shop: I'd work      for him if he would strip our furniture and teach me how to      repair and refinish antiques.    </p>    <p>      Meanwhile, we kept on buying bargain pieces . . . and      before long we had more than enough rejuvenated furniture      to fill up our home. That's when we started selling our      surplus refinishing projects at antique flea markets. When      people saw my work, they started bringing me their      furniture to be refinished. I had so much work that my wife      learned the craft and began helping me. Business kept      increasing until we formed our own company, Cabin Hill      Antiques.    </p>    <p>      Our initial investment was $400. We now own a retail shop      on "antique row," which we sublease to dealers, and a      furniture repair shop. My wife quit her job as a nurse and      runs the shop full time. This past year we grossed $26,000,      all of it from our bootstrap business!    </p>    <p>      J.B.<br />      Maryland    </p>    <p>      When my family moved to Kentucky two summers ago; we      planned on being able to sell produce from our newly      acquired farm to help make ends meet. But we soon      discovered that produce is difficult to sell in this part      of the state because of the many avid gardeners and farmers      who grow their own.    </p>    <p>      The article on page 106 of MOTHER NO. 69, "Summer      Campground Produce Peddlers," showed me that there's more      than one way to sell a tomato. After checking with many of      the local gardeners, I found out that they, too, wanted to      market their surplus produce but were having difficulty      doing so in our "land of plenty." Taking my cue from      MOTHER, I began to set up a produce exporting business,      buying locally grown vegetables wholesale and trucking them      to the nearest area of demand to resell at retail prices.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, since I already owned a one-ton truck, my      start-up costs were quite low: My initial expenses were      limited to $32 for an ad in the local paper, $15 for gas,      and approximately $125 for the first load of produce that I      bought from the local farmers.    </p>    <p>      Within a week I had made my first produce run and was busy      arranging to buy more vegetables. And after only a month,      my little enterprise showed a profit of $630!    </p>    <p>      My family and I have been able to expand to two trucks      since our first summer, and we may take on transporting and      selling other local products, such as firewood, in the near      future. Thanks, MOTHER, for showing us how to get started      in our own produce exporting business.    </p>    <p>      J.T.<br />      Kentucky    </p>    <p>      I needed a waterline put in through some 400 feet of almost      solid rock that ran between our solar homestead and a      nearby creek. My neighbor had a barbed wire fence that      needed rebuilding. So we swapped jobs: Using his backhoe,      he had my waterline in and covered in two days. And with      the help of "Putting Up a Barbed Wire Fence" in MOTHER NO.      86, I rebuilt a sturdy fence for him in practically no      time. To say that we were both pleased with the barter      would be an understatement.    </p>    <p>      C.H.<br />      Oklahoma    </p>
