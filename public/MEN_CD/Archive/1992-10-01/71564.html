                <p><strong>      JOHN VIVIAN'S DO IT YOURSELF</strong></p>            <p>      You rip open the wood-working plans to build your new swing      set or trestle table and begin reading: "Reduce stock to      57/64 ths on the planer-joiner, cut curves on the bandsaw,      scarf dovetail tenons with the plunge router, then chamfer      the blind rabbet with your radial saw's dado blade..."    </p>    <p>      Fine and dandy if you know a rabbet from a cottontail and      have a workshop full of elegant power tools. Some years      back, a suburbanite woodcraft-hobbiest displayed his      mahogany Chippendale reproductions to me. "What era of      period furniture do you prefer to build?" he asked. "Early      Poland-China," I replied. I was used to cobbling up pig      troughs out of old barn boards.    </p>    <p>      In M OTHER'S woodcraft articles, you'll find no fancy      equipment or cabinetmaker's jargon. Straightforward      carpentry with reasonably priced tools will be described in      plain English so you can build sturdy,      country-practical-projects such as decks (issue #132), a      kid's tree swing (issue #133), and mailbox posts (this      issue). In future articles, you'll find instructions for      building a U.S. Park Service-quality picnic table; an      indoor/outdoor planting bench with a wet sink; a pioneer      infant (or doll) cradle; a kid's tree fort with a secret      trap door and rope ladder; a hobby horse with a real tail      and mane, etc. Each project will detail an easy lesson or      two in practical woodcraft. Even if you don't build the      projects, just reading the articles ought to make a      practical woodworker out of you.    </p>    <h3>Equipping Your Tool Crib</h3>    <p>      First-some advice on equipping a country homeowner's      basic woodcraft/general-purpose tool crib. Had I bought one      40 years ago, I would have saved a great deal of money that      I've wasted on over-priced, over-promoted, or over-powered      equipment. This tool kit should cost you about $600, plus      another $100 to stock up on nails, screws, and other      hardware. Don't buy it all at once, though; get what you      need as you need it. Also, save money by shopping store      sales, country auctions, flea markets, and yard sales.    </p>    <h3>Defining a Good Tool</h3>          <p>      The best tool is one that does the job well with little      effort on your part. In glossy catalogs, tools aren't sold      for utility but for design and looks. Trust me, your      electric saw won't cut any straighter if it's housing has      won a design award. Another marketing tactic is tacking      added functions onto a tool that's been honed to      perfection. Such is the case of the hand ax, whose design      and function has not changed much since the Stone Age.      Trying to add a nailpuller, sawblade, and screwdriver to an      ax head will only reduce its effectiveness.    </p>    <p>      I plan to discuss plain and effective tools under these      basic woodworking functions:    </p>    <p>      measuring and marking measuring again cutting fitting      fastening finishing    </p>    <p>      But first permit me to cite the tool I use most for      woodworking and every other aspect of country life: a      little folding pocket knife. I pull it out a dozen times a      day for everything from marking precision-saw cut-lines to      scoring sheets of gypsum drywall to whittling maple sap      spiles. A knife can be any size or shape that fits the job,      but to perform safely, it must be sharp enough to cut      without the undue effort that can cause the blade to slip      and hurt you. Swiss Army knives, Bowie-style clasp knives,      and other fancy pocket knives are expensive and heavy to      carry. Worse, these blades are high-chromium stainless      steel. These blades are so hard-thus, difficult to re      sharpen-they can't be considered serious tools for      daily use.    </p>    <p>      I like a small, cheap, lightweight knife that fits in my      pocket. It must also have a single, paring-knife shaped      blade of nonstainless carbon tool steel. Such a blade      stains and is relatively soft so it will get dull; but it      will stay scalpel-sharp given a few licks on a honing steel      every day. For 20 years, my favorite knife has been the      Opinel #8. This knife is made in France and has been used      by European hikers for decades. I have a solid pear-wood      handle, and the 3 1/2" blade locks in place with a simple      revolving split ring-there are no brass bolsters to      weight it down or springs to rust. Anytime the blade gets      loose enough to open in my pocket, I dunk it in water to      swell the wood.    </p>    <p>      Better to open the blade one-handed. I filed a notch toward      the back of the slit side of the wood handle. I can put my      hand in my pocket, crack the blade open with thumb and      middle finger, then pull the handle from my pocket,      snagging the blade tip on the pocket's edge. As it comes      out, the blade opens with a satisfying click and I can turn      the locking ring with my thumb. I consider my little Opinel      an indispensable compan ion rather than a low-tech      switchblade. The #8 Opinel only costs about five dollars at      sporting goods stores, and although I have nicked a few      blades, I've never had one break.    </p>        <h3>Measuring & Marking</h3>         <p>      The most common mistake of amateur woodworkers is failing      to obtain the proper tools and taking the time to judge,      measure, and mark precisely with them. This re sults in      wasted wood and sloppy results. Don't use a fabric      measuring-tape or school ruler to build an Adirondack chair      or table set. Use rigid and flexible Carpenter's measuring      tools.    </p>    <p>      My second favorite tool is my greatgrandfather's old try      square. A 1 1/2" x 6" blade of 1/8"-thick spring steel is      sandwiched at a right angle into an 1 1/2"-thick rosewood      handle with brass fasteners and end pieces. After more than      a century of use, the angle remains a precise 90°, and      the wood of the handle has a patina to make an      antique-buff's eyes pop. I run the try square down any      board I might consider buying. It allows me to evaluate      trueness of saw cuts, squareness of joints, and fair      surfaces of planing work. I also use it to set electric      circular saw blades at a true 90° angle, and to define      right angles where needed.    </p>    <p>      An old-style, wood-handled try square maybe the one tool in      this article that you can't find at a good hardware store      (although you can find stamped metal versions for under      $5). You may have to look in woodworking magazines for      addresses of fine tool catalogs and pay $25 or more for a      good one. That's expensive, but I bet you'll find the heft      of a properly-balanced tool and the feel of the silky wood      handle a worthwhile investment.    </p>    <p>      I also use my rafter angle quite a bit. A simple right      angle with two-inch wide, two-foot long legs of 1/8"      aluminum alloy, it is cored with rule marks along all four      edges. With its two-foot lengths, it can be used to set      long boards square to one another, no matter their      orientation to level. It is also a great aid in measuring      and marking off under-two-foot lengths. The cost is about      $12 for a homeowner's model; professional versions, which      have guidelines for cutting rafters that I've never been      able to make sense of, cost up to $50.    </p>    <p>      A four-foot straight-edge of plastic or better steel, or      aluminum is the last essential rigid measuring device. It      will span the width of a standard 4' x 8' sheet of plywood      or drywall, and provide you a long enough straight edge to      measure and mark most any cut or attachment line. Buy a      pair of four-inch metal "C" clamps or two plastic      pistol-grip, one-hand clamps so you can fasten the      straight-edge on a work surface to guide a cutting tool.      Cost of a metal rule is about $15. Clamps only cost a few      bucks.    </p>    <p>      Collapsible rules of yellow-painted, six-feet-long wood      sticks jointed in the flat will help you carry six feet of      measuring capacity in your pocket. Rigid when unfolded,      they are the only way a single worker can measure true      distance overhead. Because of their thickness, it is tough      to transfer a precise measurement off of them. They are      also bulky and fragile. Many fine carpenters won't work      without one.    </p>    <p>      Steel tapes are my favorite roughcarpentry measuring tool.      An eight- to 20-foot roll of semi-flexible steel tape (with      metric and/or foot-and-inch measurements painted on it) is      spring wound inside a handy cannister. A small hook on the      end will snag over a board's edge so you can pull the tape      out to any length and measure accurately. I also use a      digitalelectronic steel tape which reads out in increments      of 1/16 ths of an inch. It's great for measuring and      recording dimensions of, say-a deck or chair, I want      to copy but is bulky for on-the-job use. Fabric tapes are      sold in 100'+ reels for room and property measurement, but      are too stretchy for precise carpentry. Other measuring      devices you can buy are a compass (or string and a nail) to      mark circles, protractors to define angles, and chalk and      cord for snaplines to define long lines.    </p>    <p>      Marking should be done with pencils or metal scribes. Pen      ink soaks so far into wood that it can't be sanded off, and      it also bleeds on wall surfaces and through waterbased      paints. Fat red-with-blackstriped carpenter's pencils are      good if the lead is whittled into a sharp-edged wedge. They      make a mark broad enough to see, but have a knife-edge to      cut by. Ordinary #2 school-type pencils are also okay if      the lead is whittled into a sharp wedge. Metal scribes mark      most precisely (I use a pocket knife) by making a shallow,      hair-thin groove in the wood. Your best bet is drawing a      broad line with the carpenter's pencil, and then scribing      the precise cutline within the lead mark with a metal      scribe. Measuring again (and again) takes no special tools      beyond mere patience. This is not easy to keep at the end      of a hot Sunday afternoon. Just bear this adage in mind:      "There is no such thing as a boardstretcher in any      carpenter's tool box."    </p>    <h3>Cutting</h3>          <p>      Saws are fun, and I have a huge collection of all kinds.      But all you really need to start are two hand saws and two      power saws. Buy yourself a pair of goodquality carpenters'      hand saws of standard 26" length and gauge of      8-teeth-to-the-inch. One should be a crosscut saw with      teeth angling off to alternate sides to slice effectively      through wood fibers. Get a goodquality rip saw of the same      size and gauge, but with teeth straight up and down to cut      smoothly along the grain of a board. Don't compromise on a      single multiple-use hand saw. While it may rough cut well,      it will neither rip nor cross-cut as well as the proper      tools. A $10 bill and change will get you a good-quality      saw that will stay sharp through years of hobby carpentry      or a house-frame supply of 2 x 4s. Don't spend more unless      you know where to find that rare bird: a local saw and      drill sharpener.    </p>    <p>      Power saws are essential for speedy woodworking. Your first      should be an electric hand-held circular saw. "Skilsaw" is      both a generic term and one popular brand name for these      little saws. For $50 to $60, you can buy a 2 to 2 1/2 hp      general-purpose model, running a 7 1/4" diameter blade.      This industry-standard tool differs from "professional"      models only in price. (House carpenters use Skilsaws,      leaving the high-priced versions for hobbiests with more      money than experience.)    </p>    <p>      The secret to a good cut is the blade's sharpness and      configuration; so purchase several in addition to the one      it comes with. Get a package of throw-away, coarsetoothed      cutoff blades for rough work-especially house      remodeling, where you will hit blade-ruining nails. Then,      for $10 per, get a fine-toothed plywood blade for cutting      sheet goods cleanly, plus a topquality hollow-ground planer      blade which will make knife-sharp cuts for precise work.      It's easier to find a shop with equipment to sharpen power      saw blades than handsaws, so you needn't spent megabucks      for superhard carbide-tipped blades. When you buy any      high-powered saw, also get a set of safety goggles. Read      and follow the instructions that come with the saw. And be      sure to find a secure place for the stamped-steel wrench      that comes with many circular saws. You'll need it to      change blades.    </p>    <p>      For carving cuts, holes, and small sawing in general, buy a      little 1/4"-shank electric jigsaw/sabersaw. While the      circular saw's round blade whirrs around at 4600 rpm, the      jigsaw's straight blade buzzes at speeds that vary      depending on nature and thickness of the material being      cut. To cut plastic, metal, and composition board as well      as wood, get a variable speed model for about $35. You'll      need hardened hacksaw-type fine-toothed blades to cut      through nails, and thin sheet steel and specialty blades      for plastic glazing thin plywood and for specialty wood      cutting. You may as well buy a package containing an      assortment of six to 10 different style blades. For most      ordinary wood working, a standard 14-tooth scroll-saw      blades works just fine. They are narrow and break easily if      bent, so I buy sev eral at a time. They will cut tight      curves in one-inch-thick wood, and will split a 2 x 4 if      you have the patience.    </p>    <p>      Not every country woodcrafter needs a reciprocating      (super)saw-a heavy, awkward, industrial-strength      device that runs a horizontal blade back and forth at slow      speeds but with unstoppable torque. It is hard to make      perfect cuts with it, but with the right blades, it will      chew its way through nails, old copper pipe, plaster, and      rock-hard oak framing. You can cut a house in half with a      super saw. Although they cost $150 and up, they're worth      it. I use mine more than any saw but the circular saw. It      even served to cut up sawmillslab firewood for a while one      winter when my chainsaws were on the fritz.    </p>    <h3>Fitting</h3>      <p>      Tools to final-fit and place wood pieces come into play      midway between cutting raw wood stock to length and shape      and fastening it together. Your right angles help determine      the 90° angles that set boards square and plumb with      one another. A carpenters' level sets boards square with      the force of gravity. Two-to-six-foot metal or wood beams      with a trio of bubble-vials in them, levels are laid      alongside boards to indicate when they're horizontal,      vertical, or at a perfect 45°. A single two-foot metal      level will do while you're starting out. Get a good one for      $15 or more.    </p>    <p>      You will need a plane to shave off small amounts of wood.      Catalogs list dozens of wood planes harking to the      preindustrial age, but I find a hardware store, all-metal      block plane works fine. I do little handplaning since I      have a planing blade on my circular saw. Also, get a set of      wood chisels in 1/16" to 1 1/2" or 2" widths for removing      wood and squaring the edges of boards where a plane won't      fit. They will also help cut holes, grooves, and notches,      and inset hinges and other hardware. A honing stone will      keep them sharp; get a two-grit oil stone with a coarse and      a fine side. You'll need an electric drill and wooddrilling      bits to make holes to fasten many projects. A small,      high-rpm 3/8" to an inch or inch and a half will cost about      $50. If you want to indulge yourself, get a set of brad-tip      twist-drill bits. They have little spiral cones at the tips      for more accurate placement. I haven't used my old brace      and bit for years, except to drill deep holes in large      timbers with old time spiral bits. You don't need a      half-inch drill and high-speed bits either for most      woodworking. Slower than the smaller drills, they are for      metal working or heavy wood beams.    </p>    <h3>Fastening</h3>     <p>      Assembly was once about pounding nails in building      construction, and screwand-glueing in furniture. But      today's woodworkers are relying more and more on      self-tapping drywall-type screws put in by high torque      electric power drivers. Not long ago, drywall      (sheertrock)-4' x 8' sheets of gypsum      wallboard-was installed with sharp, little blue-metal      nails. But too often, hammering the nails through the edges      of brittle drywall panels, into springy wood framing,      ruptured the sheetrock. Then, some genious realized that      putting a screw with a coarse (but sharp-edged) thread      through the drywall and into the framing would draw the two      together with no bounce-back. Hardened steel selftapping      "drywall" screws were born. They have Phillips-type screw      heads-grooved in a good-holding "+" shape, rather than the      traditional single slot that is prone to break or bruise      under force. Sold in medium screw sizes six and eight, in      varying lengths, and for interior and exterior use, drywall      screws can be used to fasten all but the thinnest or most      brittle materials without splitting or rupturing. And you      won't have to drill pilot holes.    </p>        <p>      After my pocket knife, the tool I use most is the electric      driver. With a variety of slot-head, Phillips and auto-type      wrench-socket bits, it is used to fasten everything from      rought barn framing to fine furniture. Plus, hard-steel      drywall screws can be removed as easily as they go in. No      more prying picture-hanging nails out of plaster or trying      to chisel a new screwdriver slot into a bruised screw head.    </p>    <p>      When it comes to power drivers, I recommend a 10-volt      variable-speed, variable-torque cordless model for      beginners. With a pair of batteries and charger, mine cost      $100. A cheaper, lower-powered driver is false economy. A      pair of charged 9.5-volt batteries will last through most      moderate building sessions and will recharge overnight. For      extended use, try a line-powered driver; if you plan to      finish many rooms with drywall, get one with an      adjustable-depth, auto-clutch chuck that will disengage      when the screw is at the proper depth. For most      woodworking, a standard chuck will do fine. At an average      of a nickel apiece, drywalls aren't cheap. But I keep on      hand an $8 box of each size from one-inch to four-inch      lengths in conventional black for inside use-and for      outside, I have all sizes in triple-galvanized or that new      silver corrosion-proof, mystery metal from Japan.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>The power tool I use the most is an electric      driver. It can fasten everything from barn framing to fine      furniture.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Hammers & Nails</em><br />      Power drivers have not made nails obsolete. Nails are cheap      and come in sizes and styles to perform fastening jobs that      drywall screws can't. You will want a set of      hammers-not one, but a set-since using too      large or small a hammer will get you bent nails. Buy an      ample two-pound clawhammer (not a huge ripping hammer) for      putting in and taking out housebuilding size nails, a      little claw-topped tackhammer for small nails and brads,      and a roundtopped ball peen hammer in a size that fits      between.    </p>    <p>      Don't be lured by the shiny, all-metal hamers with cushion      handles. Hammers with honest black-iron heads and wood      handles are a lot cheaper. More important, they are lighter      and better balanced to deliver force where it is aimed. I      also like a hammer to stand on its head when I set it down      to take a nail. Only an old-fashioned wood-handled,      flat-topped clawhammer will do that; the novelty hammers      topple right over. Iron heads may be cast in Taiwan, but      the handles are honest American white ash, and with an      occasional application of boiled linseed oil, they'll last      a lifetime.    </p>    <p>      For nails, do yourself a favor and buy "a pound of each":      thin wire brads to 12-penny spikes in galvanized, common,      flat head, and finishing styles. Better to have them on      hand, I say. With nails costing $1 or less a pound, you'll      spend perhaps $20 altogether. In time, you will use them      all.    </p>    <p>      <em>More Tools for Assembling</em><br />      You will want flat-blade and cross-shaped. Phillips-head      screwdrivers come in many sizes and lengths. I'd also      recommend buying small boxes of an assortment of      inexpensive, silver-colored steel wood screws for work that      drywall screws can't handle. Concentrate on size four      screws-too small to be sold as drywall screws (yet).      Brass screws are expensive, and I buy them in size and      quantity as needed for individual projects.    </p>    <p>      You'd also do well to wander through the hardware store,      picking out an assortment of flat washers, small tacks and      brads, "Mollies" for attaching cabinets and such to thin      walls plus both screwhead and hex-head machine bolts and      nuts and a few lagscrews, eyehooks, and      screweyes-just to have them on hand. Another $10 will      equip you nicely.    </p>    <p>      Clamps are helpful in assembling any woodworking project,      but are essential if you want to glue furniture to stay. In      time you'll want a complete assortment, but for starters      I'd recommend several of the inexpensive type with a pair      of cast-metal end brackets that slide along flat steel bars      and four of the larger version that affix to lengths of      common pipe. Each has one fixed end and an end that makes      fine adjustments with a crew-handle. Also get a plastic      bottle of Elmer's woodworkers glue. (It's the yellowish,      not the white glue.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, I'd recommend buying a good hand stapler and      staples in several lengths for another $25. You'll find      staples indispensable in fastening thin materials ranging      from fabric to aluminum flashing to plastic sheeting.    </p>    <h3>Finish</h3>      <p>      G et a good wood rasp: a coarsetoothed wood file that is      flat on one side and rounded on the other to remove stock      that the saw, plane and chisels leave behind. In addition,      a smaller round file will help to finish curves. Get      handles to fit on the sharp tang of each. Then buy      sandpaper in an assortment of grits. Sandpaper should be      affixed to a flat block or you will sand unevenly and round      the edges of your boards. You can staple half or quarter      sheets to a scrap wood block or buy a sanding block that      holds the paper with metal or rubber clamps.    </p>    <h3>One Simple Rule</h3>     <p>      We have too little space to offer many tool-use hints. But,      if there is one Cardinal rule of woodworking, it is:      <em>Let the tool do the work.</em> All you should have to      do is guide your saw, drill or hammer with a firm push. If      you find that you are exerting more pressure on a properly      maintained power saw than neecessary your blade is either      dull, it's the wrong kind, or you are trying to cut too      fast. By pushing a saw, you can ruin a straight cut, pinch      the blade enough to stall the saw and blow a circuit      breaker, or make the saw kick back on you. If you are      having to exert yourself with a hammer, the tool is too      light (and you are bound to bend nails) or your are putting      too large a nail into wood that needs a pilot hole. If a      chisel or plane isn't taking off lovely thin shavings, it      is dull or set too deep so you're trying to remove too much      at one stroke. If you are having difficulty setting screws      by hand or with a power driver, you should be drilling      pilot holes.    </p>    <p>      If they are to do the work for you, be sure to pick good      tools at the outset, maintain them well-especially      keeping their cutting edges sharp-learn their      limitations and use them with respect.    </p>
