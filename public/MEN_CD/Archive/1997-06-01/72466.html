                <p>      <strong>BITS AND PIECES</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      By MALARA P. BRAGG    </h5>    <p>      <strong>Where to get directions for anything BY MALARA P.      BRAGG</strong>    </p>        <p>      When Bob Wiley was interviewed by a French television      station about 10 years ago, he didn't think anything of it.      But within the next year, two people who had seen the      broadcast traveled separately from France to Philadelphia      and visited his unique How-To-Do-It Book Shop. Packed with      thousands of books on almost every imaginable topic, all      the books share one thing-they explain, instruct,      describe, demonstrate, and detail. They reveal just how to      do almost anything you might want to do.    </p>    <p>      Celebrating the store's 30th year this November, owners      Wiley and Steve Maurer are making it easier for      "do-it-yourself" types to get in touch with valuable      resources. Thanks to a recent mail order catalog, readers      need not travel from France to center city Philadelphia      when they can wait for a package of books to arrive at      their rural route or P .O. Box.    </p>    <p>      Founded in 1967 by Betty and Herb Shugar, the store has      long recognized an important market. Betty herself was an      original "do-if-yourselfer" and could never find the      information she wanted. Today, the store's core group of      customers are people in their 40s and 50s who have a      situation-whether it be a relationship or a      roof-and need to deal with it, Maurer says. They are      beyond the question of why; they need a how-to explanation.    </p>    <p>      "We have a saying that if we can sell somebody <em>The New      Complete Do-It-Yourself Manual</em> (Reader's Digest), we      have them for life," Maurer says. "When somebody realizes      they can fix a drain, they can handle life."    </p>    <p>      Books range from general topics like home repair to more      specialized areas, like earthworm farming. "We have books      on subjects I didn't even know existed," Maurer says.      Customers teach Maurer and Wiley about up and coming topics      so when the how-to books hit the market, they know what to      buy.    </p>    <p>      Wiley started working part-time at the book shop 25 years      ago as a college student studying English literature. Yet      the store carries no fiction, Wiley notes, or any best      sellers either. "We have to make our own best sellers," he      says. According to Maurer, Wiley was successful when he      took over the book shop from the Shugars in 1984 because he      took chances, ordered new books, and listened to customer      cues.    </p>    <p>      "When you get five calls on a topic, it lets you know      something is happening," Maurer says. After tracking down a      book on a kind of knitting native to the Faroe Islands (a      Danish county in the north Atlantic) Maurer knew exactly      what to tell the second person who called in search of a      good how-to book on the subject.    </p>    <p>      Maurer, who started out as a customer at the original      How-To-Do-It Book Shop before coming to work at the store      three years ago, says customers keep in contact with them.      One, after moving to Colorado from Philadelphia, called the      book shop to order all six books in stock, sight unseen, on      how to build your own kayak. Maurer says they get an      average of one call a week from a past customer.    </p>    <p>      Reader's Digest also has been known to rely on the      How-To-Do-It Book Shop. When researching a how-to needle      work book Reader's Digest intended to publish, a      representative from New York visited the How-To-Do-It Book      Shop and bought every related book in stock.    </p>    <p>      Still holding their own against big chain bookstores, Wiley      says he sees a growing mail order catalog business in the      book shop's future. The store also publishes a newsletter      and sponsors book signings. Because of the how-to focus of      all the books, signings sometimes also feature      demonstrations.    </p>    <p>      Wiley and Maurer can be reached Monday through Friday 9:30      to 5:30 and Saturday 10:30 to 5 at (215) 563-1516.
