                    <h3>JUNE 1997</h3>		  <p> 1 Moon near Saturn this morning.</p><p>      3 Comet Hale-Bopp passes the bright star Betelgeuse, but      both now appear too close to our line of sight with the Sun      to see.</p><p> 5 NEW MOON, 3:03 A.M. EDT.</p><p> 6 Venus farthest north      among the constellations</p><p> 10 Jupiter begins retrograde      (westward) motion against the background stars.</p><p> 11 King      Kamehameha 1 Day (Hawaii); Mars very close to star Beta      Virginis tonight and tomorrow night (binoculars assist      view).</p><p>      13 FIRST QUARTER MOON, 12:51 A.M. EDT; Friday the      13th-the only instance of it in 1997, but it can      happen 1, 2, or 3 times in a calendar year.</p><p>      14 Flag Day; earliest sunrise (5:30 A.M. DST) for 40째 N      latitude.</p><p> 15 Father's Day. 20 FULL MOON, 3:09 P.M. EDT;      West Virginia Day.</p><p> 21 Summer solstice at 4:20 A.M. EDT; Sun      enters astrological sign of Cancer at the      solstice-but enters constellation Gemini about 3      hours later.</p><p>      23 Midsummer's Eve or St. John's Eve.</p><p> 24 Moon near Jupiter      towards dawn; Midsummer's Day or St. John's Day.</p><p> 25 Mercury      at superior conjunction with Sun, hence unviewable.</p><p> 26      Latest sunset (8:33 P.M. Daylight Saving Time) for 40째      N latitude.</p><p> 27 LAST QUARTER MOON, 8:42 A.M. EDT.</p><p> 28 Moon      near Saturn this morning-as seen from extreme      southeastern U.S., the Moon passes right in front of Saturn      after sunrise (telescope required).    </p>    <p>      29 On this day in 1994, Death Valley, California and Lake      Havasu City, Arizona both hit 128째F-setting new      record highs for June in the U.S., and new all-time      record high for Arizona.    </p><p><strong>JULY 1997</strong></p><p> 1 Canada Day 2 Midpoint of the    year, 1 P.M. DST at your locali ty.</p><p> 3 The hottest place in    Canada this day in 1994 was north of the Arctic Circle.</p><p> 4    Independence Day; NEW MOON, 2:40 P.M. EDT; Earth at aphelion    (farthest from the Sun in space) at about 6 P.M.    EDT-only about 1/29th farther from Sun than when    closest back in January; Venus passes through the Beehive    Star Cluster this evening and next (telescope required); Mars    Pathfinder spacecraft lands on Mars, eventually releases    automated rover.</p><p>    5 On this day in 1900, lightning hit an oil refinery in    Bayonne, NJ and spilled oil which kept Newark Bay on fire for    3 days.</p><p> 6 Moon fairly close to Venus this evening. 7 A    tornado was seen and photographed passing the Statue of    Liberty this day in 1976, three days after the    Bicentennial.</p><p>    8 On this day in 1953, a tornado killed 116 people in Flint,    Michigan.</p><p> 9 On this day in 1953, a mile-wide tornado killed    90 people in Worcester,Massachusetts (New England's greatest    tornado disaster).</p><p>    10 On this day in 1926, lightning struck an ammunition supply    at the U.S. Naval Depot in New Jersey: 16 people died, damage    was $70 million, and debris was found up to 22 miles    away.<br />    11 Mercury passes through Beehive Star Cluster, but in bright    twilight (very difficult sight even with telescopes).</p><p> 12    FIRST <strong>QUARTER MOON, 5:44</strong> P.M.    <strong>EDT.</strong></p><p> 13 On this evening in 1977, lightning    striking a power line caused a night-long blackout of New    York City.</p><p>    14 Bastille Day.</p><p> 15 St. Swithin's Day (according to legend,    rain today will lead to 40 more days of rain in a row).</p><p> 18 In    1889 on this date, the city of Rockport, West Virginia had 19    inches of rain in 2 hours and 10 minutes-a world record for    so short a period-causing the water in a nearby creek    to rise 22 feet in 1 hour; on this same date, but in 1942,    the city of Smethport, Pennsylvania recorded 30.8 inches in 4    hours and 30 minutesanother world record.</p><p>    19 FULL MOON, 11:20 P.M. EDT.</p><p> 20 Sun enters the constellation    Cancer, noon EDT.</p><p> 21 Neptune at opposition, hence visible all    night long and brightest and biggest (but it still requires    at least binoculars and a detailed star chart to locate this    amazingly distant world); Moon near Jupiter this morning.</p><p> 22    Venus passing just south of bright star Regulus in western    sky at dusk today and tomorrow; Sun enters astrological sign    Leo.</p><p>    24 Pioneer Day (Utah).</p><p> 25 Moon near Saturn this night.</p><p> 26    LAST QUARTER MOON, 2:28 P.M. EDT; Mercury just south of    Regulus this evening.</p><p> 27 Mercury within 4 1/2" of Venus    tonight and tomorrow night.</p><p>28 Uranus at opposition, biggest    and brightest, tomorrow-but requires detailed star    chart and preferably binoculars to find.</p><p>    29 Spectacular hiding of star Aldeberan by Moon across    contiguous U.S.-but visible before sunrise (and hence    maybe with binoculars or even naked eye) only in western    two-thirds of the country (elsewhere, a telescope and very    clear skies are needed).</p><p>    30 Delta Aquarid meteor shower near peak this week-look    for meteors shooting out of the southeast in late evening and    from the south in midnight and post-midnight hours (up to 20    or more per hour might be seen in a clear sky very far from    city lights).</p><p>    31 Saturn's rings most tilted for the year around    now-12째 from horizontal, the most tilted (which is    generally favorable) since 1993 (telescope needed to see    rings, but naked eye shows Saturn as bright point of light    rising in the east in middle of the night).</p>
