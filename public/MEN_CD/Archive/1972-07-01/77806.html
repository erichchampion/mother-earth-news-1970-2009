                    <p>      <strong>THE TRUE LIGHT BEAVERS</strong><br />      From the book FEAST: A TRIBAL COOKBOOK<br />      Copyright Â© 1972 by The True Light Beavers<br />      To be published in October by Doubleday and Company, Inc.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM ZEN BASKETBALL TEAM TO MOUNTAINTOP TRIBE      -</strong>    </p>    <p>      The True Light Beaver Story    </p>    <p>      <em>Back in the Summer of '66, when family still meant      nuclear, and our heads were into dope, and reclaiming the      city streets with flowers, love, and costumes, the True      Light Beavers were born, delivered on a back shelf of Moe's      Discount Mart. Susan Beaver used to shop at Moe's for old      football jerseys, basketball shirts, and the like, finding      the beautiful colors and nice slogans (Courtesy Taxi) just      right for decorating body and soul. Her real find was a      batch of nine basketball jerseys, white and shiny green,      with the words True Light Beavers emblazoned on the front.      (The True Light Beavers, we discovered years later, were a      defunct Zen Buddhist Basketball team from Chinatown.) We      found the name fitting and symbolic of just about      everything. Instantly, the shirts were passed out among      friends, and True Light Beavers started showing up at      sweep-ins, ESSO meetings, psychedelic .showcases, be-ins,      and finally, at the raising of the Pentagon. When the      Pentagon was raised, so were many consciousnesses, and      flowers and costumes started being replaced by flags and      overalls. A big exodus started taking place: some flower      kids took</em> <em>off</em> <em>for Chicago (Yippie!),      others for the woods; some dropping out, some digging      in.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The True Light Beavers dug in! From a nuclear family of      four in New York and three its Boston, the True Light      Beavers became seven in the woods of New Hampshire.      Brothers and sisters moving together, we became a clan of      ignorant Indians, learning, that first year, how much we      didn't know. Life-art is where we're at, and that year      in</em> <em>New Hampshire meant a lot of life-art dealing      with heating a house, making a garden, stringing beads,      doing some movies, and a lot of drawing. We grew close in      New Hampshire, brothers rediscovering each other, sisters      working it out, all of us, with the kids, making it work.      We learned a little bit to read the seasons and interpret      the messages, we learned a bit that to make the      revolutionary alternative first meant getting ourselves      together . . . . New Hampshire got the clan together, a new      order came into being, and we flashed that we were at the      beginning of the biggest trip we've ever taken.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>To Woodstock! And we become more of what we are: energy      artists! The new lessons that began in New Hampshire are      continued here: we learn new skills, develop new tools. The      progession of the seasons now forms a strong rhythm for our      lives, with spring devoted to gardens, chickens, a new      baby, and plans; summer busy building new systems; fall,      harvesting and getting ready for winter, which becomes less      isolating because of the new community of many clans      growing and living around us. We find new needs and meet      them with a school, a switchboard, new medicine, food      sharing, trading, new communication systems, more land,      earth people buildings, and suddenly we find ourselves a      tribe expanded to eighteen on a mountaintop. And going      further! We find, as we build, builders all around us . . .      a tribe on every mountaintop. The years of digging in and      learning are now producing so many new life ways that are      just now beginning to trade and expand and be together      cooperatively.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>So here it is from us to you: our first collection of      many ways from many tribes . . . new tools, workable      systems, shared thoughts, and warm foods which have      nourished and fed us all for many years and which will give      us all the energy to go further.<br /></em>    </p>    <h3>      5 ROCK CITY ROAD    </h3><p>    All things have need of nourishment from above. But the gift    of food comes in its own time, and for this one must wait.    The <em>I</em> <em>CHING's</em> fifth hexagram (above: the    abysmal water, below: the creative, heaven) shows the clouds    in the heavens with food and drink. The rain will come in its    own time. We cannot make it come; we have to wait for it. The    idea of waiting is further suggested by the attributes of the    two trigrams . . . strength within, danger in front. Strength    in the face of danger does not plunge ahead but bides its    time, whereas weakness in the face of danger grows agitated    and has not the patience to wait.</p>    <p>      <em>THE IMAGE</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Clouds rise up to heaven:<br /></em> <em>The image of      WAITING.<br /></em> <em>Thus the superior man eats and      drinks,<br /></em> <em>Is joyous and of good cheer.</em>    </p>    <p>      When clouds rise iii tire sky, it is a sign that it will      rain. rain. There is nothing to do but to wait until the      rain falls. It is the same in life when destiny is at work.      We should not worry and seek to shape the future by      interfering in things before the time is ripe. We should      quietly fortify the body with food and drink and the mind      with gladness and good cheer. Fate comes when it will, and      thus we are ready.    </p>    <h3>      5 ROCK CITY ROAD    </h3>    <p>      No one could ever agree on a name for the restaurant, so it      just got called by its address. I guess that's pretty      cosmic because the number 5 hexagram in the <em>I      Ching</em>waiting (nourishment); so it will be 5 <em>Rock      City Road.</em> I don't really know how to put a restaurant      together from scratch . . . I only try to keep turning out      food that people can get feeling high from, and it's not      hard when you use the food I do. It is all good whole      grains and as much organic produce as we can find or grow      ourselves.    </p><p>      The restaurant family has fluctuated a lot in the year that      I've been here and every new person who comes to help      brings strong energy to continue the work the family has      started. Those who don't really want to contribute, well,      they usually get bored and leave, or if they can't seem to      make the move, someone in the family gives them a nudge to      help them along. I know this restaurant can't work unless      everyone involved is consciously aware of the work      necessary to keep flowing smoothly. We have had so many      meetings about this, and it is the biggest problem for      everyone to work out. The hardest role to play in these      family games is the decision-maker or foreman or whatever      you want to call it (maybe wagonmaster). You've got to work      out a way to keep your spiritual self alive, strong enough      to order people, and still be detached from the role of      ordering. Staying high has been the hardest thing to work      out for all of us. We have the dualism of wanting to split      for the woods and yet we don't know enough to live out      there very long without the society which has so heavily      imprinted us . . . it's not good or bad, it just is. We      keep trying to confront each other when a personality      "wiggle" happens, but sometimes you can get real knotted up      inside and the trouble builds pressure . . . you want to      say something about something to someone, but all of a      sudden you wonder if maybe it's not your ego coloring your      perception of a friend's actions, and you keep it inside to      protect yourself from being wrong. Well, that's when it's      got to blow, so you can get it out of your head where you      can see it. And that's what we're doing, and when we're not      doing that, we have this restaurant.    </p>    <p>      Now there's something I really like to do and that is cook,      and I can do as much as I like at the restaurant. When I      started cooking, I didn't know the first thing about the      food . . . I knew how to cook brown rice and beans (pretty      basic) but I read a whole bunch of books and pamphlets that      people had lying around and got an understanding of what      was going on. I could never, hardly ever, use the books      directly, though, because we never had a lot of things in      the recipes, so I had to sort of alter things until I      finally got more into altering than into reading, which is      just like making it up as you go along. Everyone who cooked      at 5 Rock City got great at doing just about anything in      the world with carrots and onions and squash. Anyway,      enough of this rambling . . . what I really want to say is      I'm a cook and I dig it, and I've found some things I'd      like to pass on. Ana if you don't cook, I'd just like to      mention that it isn't hard to make really good food, so      I've tried to make it all as simple to understand as it      really is . . . and these things don't taste bad either.      All the recipes are from the 5 <em>Rock City Road Cooks'      Book,</em> which is not yet published in its entirety      mainly because it hasn't been in its entirety yet, but      which is slowly being published in fragments in different      literary works. At any rate, here is a cross section of      secret recipes never before revealed to the public.    </p>    <p>      From the 5 ROCK CITY ROAD COOKS' BOOK Let's begin with      soup; it's good for you and it is cheap, two admirable      qualities.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MISO SOUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 8    </p>    <p>      1 large carrot, cut into matchsticks<br />      1 stalk celery, cut in diagonal U's<br />      1 large onion, cut in moon slivers<br />      1 1/2 quarts water    </p>    <p>      1/4 pound whole almonds<br />      Fistful of miso<br />      Tamari<br />      1/4 head cabbage, shredded<br />      Oil    </p><p>Cut veggies, heat 1 tablespoon oil, and toss in onion,    stirring until it begins to get soft. Add carrot and simmer    with cover in their own juice 1 to 2 minutes. Throw in    celery, cabbage, and almonds and stir together a minute. Add    1 1/2 quarts of water and bring to a simmering boil for about    15 minutes. Make a smooth paste from miso by adding a little    water :: . mixing. Turn off soup and cool slightly, then add    miso tamari to taste. (Miso has natural digestive agents    which shouldn't be boiled because it destroys their    properties. <em>Also:</em> Soak a long strand of wakame    seaweed for 20 minutes cut it into strips, and sautÃ©    with vegetables before adding water. Seaweed is a natural    source of calcium, vitamin D, some vitamin A, K, and over 30    essential minerals necessary for feeling and being healthy.</p>    <p>      <strong>AUTUMN VEGETABLE SOUP</strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 8    </p>    <p>      1 large carrot<br />      1 butternut squash<br />      1 acorn squash<br />      1 large onion<br />      2 stalks celery<br />    </p>    <p>      3 quarts water<br />      2 teaspoons salt<br />      1/4 pound buckwheat soba noodles<br />      Tamari to taste<br />      O il    </p><p>Cut carrot and butternut squash into matchsticks, dice    acorn squash, cut onion in moon slivers and celery in    diagonal U's. Heat a little oil (not more than 1 tablespoon)    and toss in onion, stir-frying until slightly softened. Add    other vegetables and stir-fry about 2 minutes, adding 3    quarts of water then. Bring to simmering boil, add salt, and    cook for 10 minutes, covered. Add buckwheat noodles and    bubble for 5 more minutes. Add tamari to taste.</p>    <p>      <strong>SPLIT-PEA TAHINI CREAM SOUP WITH WAKAME</strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 8    </p>    <p>      1 cup split peas<br />      1 1/2 quarts boiling water<br />      1 long piece wakame seaweed, soaked and cut into little      pieces    </p>    <p>      1 medium onion, cut into moon slivers<br />      Salt to taste<br />      2 tablespoons tahini    </p><p>Add split peas to boiling water, cover, and let simmer 1    hour. Add wakame and onion and salt and let simmer, covered,    until of creamy consistency . . . about 30 more minutes. Turn    off flame and add tahini, stirring it in until smooth. That's    all. Unless you want to add tamari for a little different    flavor. <em>After soup come a few simple grain dishes.</em></p>    <p>      <strong>AUTUMN HASH</strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 8    </p>    <p>      Oil<br />      1 large onion, cut into moon slivers<br />      1/2 butternut squash, diced fine<br />      1 medium sweet potato, diced fine    </p>    <p>      1 small yellow squash, cut into little matchsticks<br />      4 cups cooked kasha<br />      Tamari    </p><p>In 1 tablespoon oil, sautÃ© onion until slightly    soft. Add other vegetables and steam over low heat for 5    minutes with cover on. Mix in kasha, 1 more tablespoon oil,    and tamari to taste, and press into lightly oiled baking    dish. Bake at 350Â° for 20 minutes.</p>    <p>      <strong><strong>MILLET BURGERS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 4-8    </p>    <p>      2 cups cooked millet<br />      3 tablespoons tahini<br />      1 large onion, chopped<br />    </p>    <p>      1 cup buckwheat flour<br />      3 tablespoons tamari    </p><p>Mix all ingredients together and add enough water to make    a sticky batter. Spread enough batter on lightly greased    skillet to make desired size of patties. Cook over medium    flame until golden on both sides and done in middle. Eat hot    or cold. They are great for traveling.</p>    <p>      <strong><strong>CRISPY BARLEY BALLS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 4-8    </p>    <p>      2 cups cooked barley<br />      2 tablespoons sesame seeds<br />      Tamari    </p>    <p>      1/2 cup whole wheat pastry flour<br />      1 teaspoon summer savory<br />      Water    </p><p>Mix all ingredients and add enough water to make somewhat    sticky dough. Dip hands into cold water, shape dough into    little balls, and fry in deep oil until crisp and golden.    These are good to take on trips too. When forming balls, add    a sliver of umeboshi (Japanese salted plums), chopped, to    each . . . this acts as a natural preservative which will    enable you to keep the food for days.</p>    <p>      <strong><strong>CORNMEAL MUSH</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 4    </p>    <p>      This is something not many people eat or even know about,      so I want to bring it up so more people will try it.    </p>    <p>      1 cup yellow cornmeal<br />      1 cup cold water    </p>    <p>      1/4 teaspoon salt<br />      3 cups boiling water    </p><p>Mix cornmeal with cold water and drop into salted boiling    water, stirring until smooth. Turn flame as low as possible,    cover, and let bubble until creamy . . . 10 to 15 minutes.    Serve it sweet with honey and butter if you are into that, or    with sesame salt if you are not into sweets.</p><p>    <em>Next come some vegetables and salad.</em></p>    <p>      <strong><strong>VEGETABLE PIE</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Makes 1 pie    </p>    <p>      Pie doughâ <br />      Oil<br />      2 onions, cut into thin rings<br />      2 carrots, cut into diagonal ovals<br />      Roasted or raw sesame seeds    </p>    <p>      2 parsnips, cut same as carrots<br />      3 or 4 sprigs parsley, chopped<br />      2 tablespoons tamari<br />      1 small butternut squash, diced    </p><p>Roll half of pie dough to fit 9-inch pie pan. Heat about    1 tablespoon oil and toss in onions, stirring until they    begin to get soft. Add other vegetables, stir together, turn    flame to low, cover and steam 2 to 3 minutes. Add tamari and    pile into bottom crust. Roll out second crust and cover pie,    pressing edges with thumbs for sealing. Sprinkle top with    sesame seeds, after brushing crust with oil. Bake in 350Â°    oven until crust is golden brown . . . about 30 minutes.    â Pie Dough: Measure 3 cups whole wheat pastry flour    into bowl, then add 1 teaspoon salt and 3 tablespoons oil. A    little at a time, add cold water and mix with hands until a    firm but workable dough forms. Roll on floured surface.</p>    <p>      <strong><strong>DULSE-CARROT-APPLE SALAD</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves 8    </p>    <p>      1 3-ounce package dulse seaweed<br />      2 fresh apples, sliced, or 1 /8 pound dried apples, chopped    </p>    <p>      3 large carrots, grated<br />      1 cup sprouts (alfalfa or wheat are good)<br />      1 handful currants    </p><p>Wash dulse well, as it is salty, and chop. Mix all    ingredients together and add dressing. Dressing: 1/2 cup oil    (sesame and sunflower are best and unfortunately also most    expensive, but use what you've got), juice of 1/2 lemon, 1/2    cup water and 2 tablespoons tamari. Mix and pour over salad    and then toss.</p>    <p>      <strong>5 ROCK CITY ROAD DRESSING # 3</strong>    </p>    <p>      Makes 1 quart    </p>    <p>      1 cup oil<br />      1 1/2 cups water<br />      1 tablespoon dill weed<br />      2 fat cloves garlic, minced    </p>    <p>      3 umeboshi plums, pitted<br />      1/4 cup tahini . . . a good 1/4 cup<br />      1 tablespoon paprika    </p><p>Either toss everything in a blender and whip about 30    seconds, or put in bowl and whip with eggbeater or wire whip.    <em>During the winter we make vegetable tempura at the    restaurant. One of the favorite ways to make it is what we    call "vegetananda"</em></p>    <p>      <strong>VEGETANANDA TEMPURA</strong>    </p>    <p>      Serves many; just add more vegetables    </p>    <p>      1 onion, finely chopped<br />      Pieces of any uncooked leftover vegetables, chopped fine      (broccoli, cauliflower, corn, green beans, parsley...)    </p>    <p>      1 carrot, finely chopped<br />      Piece of acorn or butternut squash, chopped<br />      Basic Tempura Batter<br />      Enough oil to deep-fry    </p><p>Mix vegetables with tempura batter and drop into oil    heated to 350Â°. Never let oil smoke as it is much too hot    then. Use a large wooden spoon for dropping, allow to get    golden on one side, then turn and do same to other. Remove    from oil and drain well to remove excess oil. Serve with    Ginger-Tamari Sauce.â  Basic Tempura Batter (eggless):    Mix together 2 cups soy powder, 1 cup whole wheat pastry    flour, 1 cup corn flour or finely ground cornmeal, salt to    taste, and 5 cups water. Batter should be as cold as possible    for best tempura. â G inger-Tamari Sauce: 1 cup water,    3 tablespoons tamari, and 1 tablespoon grated ginger. Whip    together in blender or shake together in jar and sit in    refrig an hour or two. Dip vegetanandas in sauce and    eat.</p>    <h3>BREADS</h3>    <p>      <strong>5 ROCK CITY ROAD OVERNIGHT      BREAD</strong>    </p>    <p>      3 cups cooked grain (rice is always good, but for a change,      barley is great and so is millet)<br />      1 cup whole wheat flour<br />      2 cups cornmeal    </p>    <p>      1/4 cup oil<br />      1 rounded teaspoon salt<br />      Water<br />      1 cup buckwheat flour    </p><p>Mix everything but water together until well blended. Add    water until dough is sticky and feels like patting a fat    stomach. Cover and let sit in warm place overnight. Put in    oiled bread pan and run knife around edges to keep from    sticking. Put in cold oven and turn on to 350Â°, baking    until done through . . . 1 to 1 1/2 hours. (It should look    golden and not feel soft when squeezed with your fingers.)    Remove from pan by hitting end of bread pan flat on hard    surface and turning bread out into other hand. Cool before    cutting. Serve with miso-tahini spread: walnut-sized piece    miso softened with a little water, about 3 times as much    tahini (it's up to you how strongly miso you want it), then    mix together to smooth paste. This is a basic recipe to which    can be added minced onions or parsley, or garlic, sprouts,    grated carrots, any number of things.</p>    <p>      <strong>CORN BALLS</strong>    </p>    <p>      2 cups cornmeal<br />      1/2 cup buckwheat flour<br />      3 cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 teaspoon tamari<br />      Water    </p>    <p>      1 onion, chopped fine<br />      1 teaspoon salt<br />      3 tablespoons oil<br />      1 cup whole wheat pastry flour    </p><p>Mix all ingredients but water until blended. Add water    until dough is sticky enough to roll into little ping-pong    ball-sized pieces. Do this by dipping your hands in cold    water and rolling in in palms. Bake in 375Â° oven for 20    to 25 minutes, until golden.<br />    <br />    <strong>EGGLESS FRENCH TOAST</strong></p>    <p>      4 tablespoons soy powder<br />      2 cups water    </p>    <p>      4 tablespoons tahini<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt    </p>    <p>      Mix ingredients together in blender or wire beater or wire      whip. Soak yeast bread in batter and cook on lightly      greased griddle until done on both sides. Serve with apple      butter.</p><h3>SAUCES</h3>     <p>      <strong>BASIC WHITE SAUCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      Makes 1 cup    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons sesame seeds<br />      3 tablespoons whole wheat<br />      pastry flour or barley flour    </p>    <p>      2 tablespoons oil<br />      1 cup water<br />      Tamari    </p>    <p>      Dry-roast sesame seeds until golden and crumbly when rubbed      between fingers. Add flour and oil and roast flour, .      stirring constantly, about 5 minutes over medium heat.      Slowly add water, whipping all the time with a wire whip      (this is the best tool I know to get unlumpy sauce, and      they're cheap). Stir with whip until sauce comes to boil      and is thick. Turn off and allow to cool a few minutes      before adding tamari to taste. This is one of the best      grain sauces, vegetable sauces, and just about everything      sauces I've found.<br />      <br />      <strong>TAHINI-ONION SAUCE<br />      <br /></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 medium onion, chopped fine<br />      1 teaspoon oil    </p>    <p>      1 cup water<br />      Tamari to taste<br />      2 tablespoons tahini    </p>    <p>      SautÃ© onion lightly in oil, add tahini and mix and      then add water, slowly beating with wire whip until smooth      and thick.

While they drain, chop      vegetables and grate cheese. Grind beans through a meat      grinder (it's really worth it to get a meat grinder to make      your own meat substitutes because the canned stuff is      usually garbage). Put 1 tablespoon of the oil into pan and      sautÃ© garlic, onion, and green pepper slightly, then      add ground adzuki beans and remaining oil and also herbs,      salt, and tamari to taste. Stir together a few minutes over      medium-high flame, add about 2 cups of water from soaked      adzukis, stir, turn down flame, and cover, letting it cook      until water is absorbed. If beans still seem a little hard,      add another cup of water and cook a little longer . . .      they should have a rough texture, not be mushy.

Bose, India's great scientist    </p>    <h3>BERRY PICKING IN THE WILD</h3>    <p>      Awareness of the seasons becomes so acute as to become      awareness of what berries are ripening in what meadow, on      what slope, under what bridge, at what time. Nature still      provides enormous quantities of wild berries: strawberries      in late June, early July; blueberries in July; red      raspberries early in August; blackberries late in August.      To gather the berries, you should know where to look for      them, then keep constant watch on the spot for the moment      of ripening.    </p>    <p>      Last summer was one stoned venture after another into      meadows, checking out the main blackberry patch every three      days to see if those red ones last week were black yet. We      often raced against storms, bears and birds to get to the      berries, and in time, developed some pretty sophisticated      and <em>very</em> stoned, gathering techniques.    </p>    <p>      Meadow picking is pretty easy . . . if you can get there      before the bear and deer do. Late afternoon is a nice time      to go berrying. It ends the day nicely and means that the      berries have had a full day of sunlight to aid in ripening.      When we pick, we go to the meadow first, picking the ripe      berries, and making mental notes of berry bushes still to      ripen. At the height of the blackberry season, we hit the      same meadow every three days, getting at least 10 quarts of      berries in just two hours of picking each time. But that's      not the half of it. Meadow picking is merely an      introduction into the pleasures of berrying. To the      intrepid picker, there are <em>many ways</em> of getting to      those hidden berries at the sides of roads or down slopes.    </p>    <p>      Susan is our champion road picker. Driving up to and down      from the meadow on the dirt road, Susan spies a bush here,      another bush there of ripening berries. "Stop the car," she      shouts excitedly, "we really can't pass over that bush."      Hence begins Susan's road trip . . . a slow drive up and      down the three miles of dirt road, with stops every few      minutes to gather the fruit from solitary bushes that      eagle-eye Susan has seen off in the woods. No one can match      Susan's eyesight, nor the speed with which she bounds out      of and back into the car. Nor can anyone ridicule her      favorite method of gathering berries, because it, too,      yields berries by the gallon.    </p>    <p>      Colleen's theory is that if you look for berries in the      most difficult-to-reach spot, you'll find them in great      abundance. "After all," she reasons, "there isn't an animal      in the forest stupid or brave enough to go through what I      go through to get to those berries." Dressed in long pants,      hiking boots, and a leather shirt, hair tied back, Colleen      climbs down impossibly steep slopes and works her way into      the bushes going up the slopes. This means numerous falls      and incredible hangups in bushes that snag and tear at any      available piece of loose clothing or hair, but it also      means getting at bushes that haven't been touched all      summer and are consequently overloaded with berries.    </p>    <p>      Whatever way you dig doing berries, do it. It helps,      though, to wear clothes that will protect you from      scratches and at the same time won't get snagged. Long      denim pants, longsleeved shirts, leather jackets, and maybe      even gloves are good protective articles of clothing . . .      scarves, hats, bound-up hair, keep thorns from tearing at      your hair. It's nice to have both hands free, either for      getting at berries, or for disentangling yourself from      bushes. So punch a couple of holes in some coffee cans,      thread some string through the holes, and tie the cans      around your waist. Climb hills, work your way through      meadows, and dig on the sun, grasses, bees, flowers, and      berries.</p><h3>       SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS</h3>      <p><strong>BETSYE'S SALAD GAME</strong>    </p>    <p>      Spinach <em><br /></em> Bananas<br />      Nuts<br />      Mushrooms<br />      Cucumbers<br />      Onions    </p>    <p>      <em>Dressing:</em><br />      Lime juice<br />      Good-tasting oil<br />      Salt and pepper<br />      Any spices you think of    </p>    <p>      Combine all or some of the above.

Make a paste with garlic, salt,      beaten egg yolk, mustard, and 1 tablespoon of the lemon      juice. Adding it 1 teaspoon at a time, beat in 1/2 cup      olive oil (no substitutes). Add slowly and alternately      another 1/2 cup olive oil and 2 tablespoons lemon juice      (bit by bit). The most necessary thing is to add the oil      very slowly and then beat thoroughly after each addition.      This makes 1/2 pint of spicy, garlicky mayonnaise. Don't      try to do it with a blender. It beats in too much air and      the mayonnaise never thickens. We eat it on a salad of raw      mushrooms and raw spinach, when we can get both.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>RACHEL'S DIET SALADS AND SALAD      DRESSINGS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Makes 1/2 pint    </p>    <p>      Fruit Salad:<br />      Pears<br />      Apples<br />      Bananas    </p>    <p>      Cantaloupe<br />      Nuts<br />      Currants or raisins    </p>    <p>      Pour juice of fresh orange over this and mix.    </p>    <p>      <em>Variations:</em> Sprinkle granola over fruit and/or add      yogurt, apple juice, or a mixture of apple, lemon, and      orange juices.    </p>    <p>      Vegetable Salad:<br />      Cauliflower<br />      Iceberg lettuce<br />      Peas<br />      Raisins    </p>    <p>      Nuts<br />      Apples<br />      Pears<br />      Cantaloupe    </p>    <p>      <em>Dressing:<br /></em> Juice of an orange<br />      Some apple juice    </p>    <p>      Some lemon juice (less thanother juices) to taste    </p>    <p>      <br />      <strong><strong>TONI'S REFRESHING 4-MINUTE      SALAD</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      1 1/2 cups fresh alfalfa sprouts<br />      1 large cucumber, cut in half lengthwise and thinly      (translucently) sliced<br />      3 or 4 radishes, very thin    </p>    <p>      1 box fresh, sweet blueberries<br />      6-8 slices Munster cheese, torn into pieces the diameter of      the sliced radishes    </p>    <p>      Toss in a bowl and serve.

It is a good relaxer. It is good      for sore throats: mix with garlic (an antibiotic) and lemon      (citrus . . . vitamin C) and spoon it into your mouth.      Honey is sterile, so germs cannot live in it. If you get a      bad burn, slap some honey on it until you can get to the      old doc.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEMONADE:</strong> Float a few lemon balms on top      in the pitcher.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEPPERMINT:</strong> Peppermint is good for upset      stomachs, and good for morning sickness.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MARJORAM:</strong> Hang it in the window to keep      bad witches away. Also use it as a good accent in sour      cream. As a tea, it is good for tension headaches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TANSY, BASIL, RUE:</strong> They are good fly      repellents. Tansy sprinkled around the cracks in the floor,      or in the cellar, will keep ants away.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAMOMILE TEA:</strong> Use it for headaches,      stomachaches, worms. It's also good as a hair rinse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RUE AND THRIFT (CALLED SEA PINKS):</strong> Will      expel worms.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MILK AND MEAT OF COCONUT:</strong> Coconut is a      terrific laxative and is good for hemorrhoids. It is more      effective than prunes, which give some people gas. By the      way, if you have hemorrhoids, don't eat nuts or anything      with small seeds (raspberries, blueberries, strawberries,      etc.).    </p>    <p>      <strong>CRANBERRY JUICE:</strong> Add to your cranberry      juice a touch of ginger and some fruit sherbet . . . it's      dynamite.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GINGER:</strong> It's good for your stomach.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POTATOES, ONIONS, APPLES AND</strong>      <strong>CARROTS:</strong> Do not store them together with      each other. They give off gases which make other foods      spoil faster.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DANDELIONS:</strong> Boil them in water, and use      them for your skin. They're very good for it.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OATMEAL:</strong> Wash your face really well. Put      oatmeal on your face. (You don't even have to cook it. Just      add water.) Leave on your face until dry. Wash off with      water and a tiny bit of milk. It makes your skin soft and      smooth, tightens it removes oils.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLOVES:</strong> Cloves are good to chew are good      to chew on for healthy teeth.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEES:</strong> Bees are enraged by the smell of new      blue denim. Always wash any clothing made of new blue denim      first before wearing outside, otherwise you run a big risk      of being (bee-ing) stung. Beekeepers never wear denim on      the job . . . most of them wear white.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANISE:</strong> Mix with lard or shortening for      lice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>AJUGA REPTANS:</strong> Also known as bugleweed, it      is a common rock garden thing, often used in California as      a ground cover. Mildly narcotic, resembles digitalis in      action.
