                		<h5 id="byline">by MARJ COVERLEY</h5>    <p>      If you're already living on the land, you may well lie      awake quiet nights dreading the day when either people from      the cities or refuse from those steadily expanding Big      Towns will flow, relentless as swift lava, over your      paradise . . . and if you're still trying to tough it out      in a metropolitan area you're surely haunted-at least      occasionally-by the vision of no pure land left to      visit "out there" at all.    </p>    <p>      Clearly, something must be done. Population growth must be      curbed and our rip-it-up-stamp-it-out-throw-it-away way of      doing business replaced by something better.    </p>    <p>      But how does a mouse lean on an elephant? How do little      individuals begin turning the monster around . . . even the      tiniest bit? Well, a number of folks across the land have      made their start by collecting and returning for      remanufacture some of the incredible amount of waste the      nation generates daily.    </p>    <p>      Sure, sure . . . we all know that such action is a stopgap      and largely symbolic gesture. But it is a start, and a few      groups-like G.E.R.M., in California-are even      making it pay off.    </p>        <p>      The Green Earth Recycling Movement was established in June      of 1970 and just 12 months later-in June of      '71-we opened a <em>permanent</em> recycling center      to serve Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and Redondo Beach      in Los Angeles' South Bay. The new facility (donated by the      Redondo Beach City Council) covers an acre and is fenced,      graded and landscaped. It was designed to accept six      transfer bodies at once and sturdy elevated platforms at      each station make loading the containers a breeze.    </p>    <p>      It took only a scant year of dedication, then, to establish      a smoothly running, almost self-service center that turns a      tidy profit. Yes, it was hard work . . . but we did it. So      can you.    </p>    <p>      Initially, unless you're very fortunate, you'll probably      have to start-as we did-with a "conditional"      center and contract for collection trucks and bins as you      need them. We persuaded Lucky Stores, Inc. to let us use a      portion of their parking lot two weekends a month. In      exchange, we pointed out that people stopping to recycle      trash would likely shop at the market . . . and we promised      to keep the collection area clean and presentable. We had      trouble with the "clean and presentable" part of our      agreement right from the start, however, and continually      faced the possibility that the market would evict us.    </p>    <p>      By December, 1970-when Lucky's interest in recycling      had noticeably paled-we set out to find a permanent      location for our growing business. No luck . . . but we did      persuade Culver Savings and Loan (across the street from      the Lucky store) to House us for a few (it turned out to be      six) more months.    </p>    <h3>TIPS ON PICKING A SITE FOR YOUR CENTER</h3>    <p>      As you look for a site-temporary or      permanent-for your recycling collection point, keep      in mind that (1) the location should be easily accessible      and visible from the street and (2) you should plan right      from the start to keep the station open often enough to      make recycling a convenient habit for even the most      reluctant housewife.    </p>    <p>      If you're forced to operate on a "drive" basis in the      beginning, schedule those drives regularly-we staged      our initial collections third weekends of every      month-so that a single advertisement will tell people      when to use your facilities on <em>any</em> month.    </p>    <p>      The longer you can persuade your first landlord to let you      stay, the better. The "creature of habit" is still alive      and well in urbania (as elsewhere) and, in time people will      work your center into their Saturday morning errand      patterns.    </p>    <p>      The "permanence" of your operation also helps to solve the      most basic problem of convincing city officials and local      businessmen that your plan is "serious" and "workable".      Many pillars of our community seemed to resist us not      through a dislike of recycling or fear that it would      compromise their business interests, but because they were      afraid that "ecology" was a passing fancy. No kidding! They      didn't want to be caught supporting something that might      suddenly brand them "behind the times".    </p>    <p>      Expect to have to hustle to keep any temporary sites      donated to you . . . we worked hard to maintain use of both      of ours. Once, at Lucky's, the glass bin was accidently      tipped over while being loaded onto the transfer truck and      the market's manager naturally took an uptight view of      three tons of broken bottles in his parking lot. We all      turned out to sweep up and the manager let us stay on . . .      impressed, I think, less with the salvaging of resources      than with our determination to keep the operation running.    </p>        <p>      During those months we continued trying-with      shrinking success-to convince the City Council of      Mahattan Beach to set aside land for our use, though end      for our use. In the end, (after a solid year of cajoling      and wheedling Manhantan Beach), it was Redondo Beach that      offered us a piece of city property for "as long as we      liked".    </p>    <p>      The success was due, as much as anything, to the fact      that-from the beginning-we were prepared to      work with <em>everyone.</em>    </p>    <p>      Almost any community, even a "with it" beach town, is      populated with people of all ages and interests. To make      out operation a success, we needed the trash generated by      folks of widely divergent persuasions. ... so we played no      favorites.    </p>    <p>      Our ("our" being mother Earth, a grup of fustrated oil      refinery hecklers) very first step-even before we got      into the problems of locating land for either a temporary      <em>or</em> permanent recylcing center-was to contact      the Environmental Control Officer of Manhattan Beach. I      stress this is a first step not because the Manhattan Beach      City Council represented any actual support-even the      openly sympathetic members were paralyzed by committee      decisions-but because it operated as a perfect      contact exchange board. In an effort to get rid of us, in      other words, the Manhattan Beach City Council put us in      touch with everyone else in town who had ever tried to      start a recyling program.    </p>    <p>      Through the MBCC, we contacted the American Associaion of      University Women, the Dolphins (the local Junior Women's      Club), the ecology groups at El Camino College, three      nearby high shools, the Girl Souths and the Welcome      Wagon... and w e mutually decided to pool all efforts to      establish a continuing recycling center.    </p>    <p>      Yes, conflicts did arise within our coalition. At one      point, the El Camino kids arranged to deal with the      underground Peace Press because the Press would allow us to      use their I.B.M. Composer in the wee hours of the morning      to print up our flyers. More conservative elements      objected. They' didn't want to get our group involved with      the Peace Press because it was on a list of subversive      organizations. In the end, however, we used the Press for      composing and a respectable local printer donated the      printing. Strange bedfellows for a good cause.    </p>    <p>      The most active group we joined with was the American      Association of University Women. They had already held two      recycling drives with success and had an invaluable      connection with ABCO Disposal Company.    </p>    <p>      ABCO, a vigorous trash collection firm with long-range      plans for mass refuse recycling, runs a "transfer station"      in a nearby suburb. The station is solving current problems      of overcrowding and longdistance transportation to the two      landfill sites in Los Angeles by acting as a halfway site      for nearby city sanitation trucks. The trucks pay to drop      off raw trash at ABCO and the company uses sophisticated      sorting methods to separate and gather recycle-able      materials. ABCO compacts the remainder and moves it to the      sanitary landfill. In the future, bio-degradable material      will be composted to provide commercial-grade fertilizer.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, ABCO was interested in our recycling efforts      both from a public relations standpoint and as a future      contributor to their waste conservation program. They      provided the bins and transportation for our first      collection free, and let us defer hauling costs until      several drives later when we were clearing enough money to      handle the charges.    </p>    <p>      A13CO also provided primary advice in the early days. The      company's representatives, for instance, pointed out the      necessity of breaking each bottle as we threw it in the      bin: it takes up less space that way. Crush all cans for      the same reason: salvage companies pay for weight only . .      . not bulk!    </p>    <h3>AND A WORD ABOUT RECYCLING PLANT AND ANIMAL      WASTES</h3>    <p>      One of the greatest obstacles to recycling natural wastes      is the tax advantage given to chemical and mining interests      by the government . . . an advantage actually greater than      the notorious one enjoyed by oil companies. This unfair      leverage allows the chemical and mining giants-who,      in effect, are not forced to bear the <em>real costs</em>      of manufacturing the fertilizers they produce-to      undersell natural, recycled fertilizer and, thereby, hold a      tight rein on the market.    </p>    <p>      If this unfair leverage were taken away from the chemical      and mining concerns, we would quickly see the merits of      composting agricultural, food and other such wastes into      commercial-grade plant food. This would save local      governments millions of dollars in disposal costs (burying      and burning), produce an ideal fertilizer at low cost and      dramatically slow our current reckless consumption of      natural resources.    </p>        <p>      Once we had a site and trucks lined up, we were ready to      let folks-both the "established" community and the      beach people-know we were in the recycling business      and needed their support.    </p>    <p>      We went after individuals with flyers and posters along the      beach and in the shops. Groups were even easier to contact:      we obtained a list of community      organizations-everything from the Seroptimists to the      Sierra Club-through the Chamber of Commerce. (All you      have to do is call the Chamber and ask. . . they're happy      to send a complete list pronto.)    </p>    <p>      The best approach for "prominent" groups is a formal letter      explaining the problem and setting out your plans. We then      asked each group, in our first mailing, if it would like to      actively participate as a sponsor. The red tape from      long-reputed "granfalloons" was everything you'd suspect,      but results were surprisingly good. We found that as long      as we approached each organization through its own      "etiquette pattern" (neat letter, follow-up call, time to      take the issue to members for a vote), the members were      open-minded and helpful.    </p>    <p>      Some of the groups were already recycling-usually      news papers and aluminum cans-on a sporadic basis.      This is a passable way to raise money, but it really      doesn't educate people about waste ecology . . . so several      organizations with such programs underway joined us. The      ecology club from T.R.W. Systems stopped hauling their      refuse across town and brought their brimming V.W. buses to      the center. The Girl Scouts called a halt to the individual      collections they had been making and went door-to-door with      our flyers instead.    </p>    <p>      The organizations that weren't onto ecology the first time      around were quick to respond to our second letter, in which      we offered to send a speaker and slides to one of their      meetings. Soon, Green Earth members were giving slide talks      two or three nights a week. We also set up an "information      spot" at the collection drives we conducted so that anyone      who wandered in by accident would learn exactly what was      happening.    </p>    <p>      Our approach was successful . . . must have been, because      it led us hard against the problem of how to deal with the      staggering amount of trash that came pouring in! At our      very first setup in June of 1970, ABCO left us one      forty-cubic-yard transfer-body (a large walk-in box affair)      for newspapers and six tree-cubic-yard receptacles . . .      one for clear glass, one for colored glass, one for      aluminum cans, one for corrugated paper and two for tin.    </p>    <p>      Surprisingly, the material we collected-5 1/2 tons of      newspapers, 1/4 ton of corrugated paper, over a ton of      clear and colored glass, 1/3 ton of tin cans and 140 pounds      of aluminum-filled most of the bins.    </p>    <p>      As that first summer progressed-and the amounts of      refuse we collected leapfrogged-we never knew how      many trucks or bins we'd need for the next drive. This      proved to be a big bummer, because it prevented us from      showing a profit. Our only "cost" at that time, you see,      was the hauling of the bins and transfer-bodies to salvage      buyers. Since we had to vacate our temporary sites at the      end of each weekend, we often had to pay for transporting      bins that were only half full . . . an and there's no      percentage in the drayage of empty space. It was just as      disastrous to have too few containers as it was costly to      have too many.    </p>    <p>      Slowly, however, our logistics problem began to solve      itself. By early 1971 the amounts of refuse we collected      had begun to stabilize and we usually had a good idea of      how many trucks we'd need for a drive and how fast we'd      fill them. By that time our "good faith" had also been      recognized and we were allowed to leave transfer bodies in      the borrowed parking lot from one drive to the next . . .      so we stopped using the small bins entirely and switched to      the more efficient 40-cubic-yard bodies for everything.    </p>    <p>      During the winter and spring of 1971 we were receiving      about 7 1/2 tons of newspapers per drive (a truck will hold      approximately 20 tons), 5 tons of clear glass and 5 tons of      colored (a transfer-body holds 10 tons of glass, so we      hauled glass after every other drive), 1 1/2 tons of tin (a      truck holds 3 tons) and roughly 200 pounds of aluminum.    </p>    <p>      Since opening our permanent center in June of 1971, the      amounts of waste we collect have continued to leapfrog.      We're now gathering over 1,000 pounds of aluminum a month,      up to 33 tons of newspapers, 20 tons of glass, 4 tons of      tin and 2 tons of corrugated.    </p>    <p>      We've had only one "space" crisis since putting the the      permanent center into operation. That was when we closed      the operation over last season's Christmas holiday. Then it      rained. When the sun came out, so did everyone in town . .      . with a month's newspapers. Next time we'll have an extra      truck on hand (in colder areas, such foresight is      critical).    </p>    <p>      Gradually, through trial and error and experience, we've      learned to both forecast and level out the peaks and      valleys of the refuse we collect . . . to our financial      advantage. We've also improved our dollars-and- cents      picture by finding ways to "cushion" or stabilize the      prices we're paid for the salvage we sell.    </p>        <p>      At first, of course-like so many other groups into      recycling-we were completely at the mercy of the      salvage buyers who did or didn't accept (at their own      prices) what we sent them. Newspaper sank from $14.00 a ton      in June, 1970 to $7.00 a ton in December . . . and, by      January of '71, paper companies in our area weren't buying      recycled newspapers at all. Obviously, such a situation was      intolerable to us so we worked out a deal with Pioneer      Paper: we fill a bin three or more times a month and      Pioneer guarantees us $6.00 a ton, gives us use of their      transfer bins and absorbs hauling costs.    </p>    <p>      We have a similar deal to deliver corrugate (which had      earlier gone from $15.00 a ton to a "no-buy" status) at a      fixed rate of $10.00 a ton.    </p>    <p>      Tin was a really tough one. In the summer of 1970 there was      no market for it at all. The amount of metal in a modern      "tin" can is so slight that the containers vaporize into      ash in a melting heat. We did persuade an independent      salvage company to haul tin for us . . . once. The cost was      $50.00 and the load sold for $5.25. So we stored our tin      cans with ABCO until-finally-in the spring of      1971, various salvage companies began buying tin cans for      $14.00 a ton.    </p>    <p>      We have established some degree of stability for ourselves      in the perennially uncertain salvage market, then . . . but      our battle is far from over. ABCO has recently expressed an      unwillingness to continue hauling for us and we may have to      purchase our own transfer bodies.    </p>    <p>      To stave off this burden, we're trying to work out more      direct agreements with companies that have a specific use      for a particular recycled material. Currently, for example,      we're arranging to sell tin cans to a company for $12.00 a      ton. The firm will also (as does Pioneer with newspapers)      lend us a transfer bin and absorb hauling costs. We find it      increasingly easier to land such contracts as our volume      goes up.    </p>    <p>      Large volume or small, Reynolds Metal has fixed the price      of aluminum at $200.00 a ton. Though their corporate heart      is in the right place, their recycling operations      are-unfortunately-largely "public relations".      Several times our trucks have been sent back 30 miles      across town because the Reynolds collection center wasn't      equipped to handle volume loads that day.    </p>    <p>      The mere fact that Reynolds is playing the game, though,      has encouraged other firms to jump on the ecology      bandwagon. Some are even virtually subsidizing the price      for recycled material.    </p>    <p>      Owens-Illinois is paying $20.00 a ton for glass and, in      combination with Sessler Glass Co., is absorbing the      problem of removing labels and aluminum rings from the      necks of the bottles they accept . . . even though they      presently use only 40% of the glass they buy. Owens hopes      to reuse 100% of the recycled glass eventually (the clear      variety is easy . . . what they're looking for is a      reliable use for the more plentiful colored returns) and      already has developed a road paving made of crushed      bottles.    </p>    <p>      New uses for refuse <em>are</em> being found. The tin we      gather is now being sent to Arizona where it's put into      service in the strip mining of copper. Yes, "strip mining"      is decidely an eleven-letter word to ecology-conscious      people . . . but it's at least a small step in the right      direction when we use recycled tin for this particular      process rather than plunder the land for fresh tin with      which to plunder for copper. We definitely must keep our      eye on the main battle . . . but we mustn't forget the      smaller skirmishes either. With some of the profits we      realize from our recycling center, we hope to exert,      pressure where necessary to insist that the results of our      efforts are in keeping with the Green Earth spirit.    </p>    <p>      The deeper we get into our project, the more we realize      that each step forward is a hopscotch into new challenges.      At first, we worried only about clearing enough money to      keep our operation alive long enough to establish it on a      permanent basis.    </p>    <p>      That hurdle was cleared when Redondo Beach fenced, graded      and planted trees on land for our use . . . but the city's      generosity forced us to spend $950.00 for concrete pads on      which to park the transfer-bodies and to build catwalks      between them.    </p>        <p>      Then we found we needed to hire a friend to "sit" the      center while it's open, clean up afterward      and-generally-look out for the place. About      that time, too, one little boy was bitten by a rabbit that      lived under the bins and loose talk of lawsuits sent us      running to a lawyer. We now have insurance coverage for the      operation and we're applying for a non-profit incorporation      with the State of California.    </p>    <p>      Still and all-even with painting, signs and other      expenses-we're clearing between $500 and $700 a month      and it's great to see our recycling center brimming with      people and trash Tuesday and Thursday afternoons and all      day Saturday. Our tonnage is increasing and most of our      headaches are disappearing. The total amount of refuse we      handle certainly doesn't deplete the city's trash      collection much, but it's a start.    </p>    <p>      We're all volunteers and we plow the profits we make into      waste education and enlarging our G.E.R.M. of an idea. If      you duplicate our success on your own, however, you might      apply what you make toward a homestead you could rest a      little easier in . . . knowing that the folks in town who      followed your example will be far less likely to toss trash      in your direction    </p>        <h3>WHAT'S A "STABILIZED" PRICE FOR      SALVAGE?</h3>    <p>      The G.E.R.M. price stabilizing procedure really comes down      to just one word: wheedle. Salvage buying and selling is      still an unstable business in which it definitely pays to      bargain and deal. Whenever possible, move in the direction      of sorting the refuse you collect and selling each specific      material directly to a company with a use for the      particular commodity.    </p>    <p>      It's most important to point out to businessmen just where      their self-interest really lies . . . this, they respond      to. Now that the glass companies have been convinced that      they'll have extensive use for recycled glass in the      future, for example, they're "subsidizing" the price right      now as a "public relations" move to keep the supply liquid      until they tap it for real.    </p>    <p>      We've found two persuasive ploys that work well for us when      we're opening markets for our recycled materials:    </p>    <p>      (1) The <em>real</em> cost of salvage vs. new material is      illusory. If companies were forced to actually <em>pay</em>      for the cost of new resources-pollution and      waste-wise-salvage (even salvage needing some      reprocessing) would be much cheaper.    </p>    <p>      (2) When you have material procured on a volunteer basis      (getting cans out of a house) vs. resources obtained on a      paid basis (getting metal out of the ground), there      <em>has</em> to be a profit somewhere for the companies      handling the materials gathered by volunteers. This is      especially true in the case of aluminum (recycled aluminum      cans are both less expensive and easier to remanufacture      than starting fresh with new ore).    </p>    <p>      Admittedly, sophisticated ecological and economic arguments      make little headway with the local can man . . . so we push      and hope for the best deal we can get. When I say      "stabilized" prices in my article, then, read "agreed on".
