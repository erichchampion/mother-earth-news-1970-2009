                		<p>      This is your last chance to take advantage of the old tax      law.</p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Bob Keim, C.P.A.    </h5>    <p>      I know, it's five months until tax time, and you don't want      to think about it right now. You're going to save a bundle      with the new tax law anyway, right?    </p>    <p>      Maybe, maybe not. If you've itemized your deductions over      the last few years, you may have a very unpleasant surprise      waiting for you on April 15, 1988. There are ways to head      off some of the pain, though. By taking advantage of being      on the cusp of the taxlaw shift, you can save money.    </p>    <p>      Consider carefully the financial balance between the      savings offered by the following methods and the lower      marginal tax rates that will be in effect next year. (For      example, if you're a farmer, you may want to purchase feed      and seed this year for use next year, since your tax rate      will be lower next year.)    </p>    <p>      My calculator has been running full speed since the tax law      was finalized in late August (the proposed legislation      hasn't actually been passed by Congress as MOTHER goes to      press). Here are a few of the approaches I'm recommending      to my customers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. Incorporate or become self-employed, if you      can</strong> . Many of the deductions previously available      to employees and individuals have been stripped from the      new tax law. Only those employee business expenses in      excess of 2% of adjusted gross income will be deductible,      and those can only be used as itemized deductions. A number      of items-including union dues and tax preparation      fees-that you may have deducted on the line      Miscellaneous Deductions from Schedule A (Itemized      Deductions) will no longer be allowed. Sales tax will no      longer be deductible for individuals. In fact, as of      January 1, 1987, many cherished deductions of the citizen      with one employer will disappear.    </p>    <p>      In order to optimize your deductions, you must be either      self-employed or the employee of your own corporation. Bear      in mind that this strategy is acceptable to the IRS only if      you have more than one source of income. It may be time to      do work on the side and arrange to be a consultant to your      present employer.    </p>    <p>      Incorporation will be advantageous even to sole proprietors      and partners, because it will allow you to defer income      into the future, when tax rates will be lower. You can pay      yourself a minimal salary and declare bonuses based on      profits at a later date.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. Realize capital gains.</strong> As of January 1,      1987, there will no longer be a 60% exclusion for capital      gains income. If you've been holding stocks or other      property for more than six months and if they've      appreciated in value and you've been considering selling      them, do so before the end of the year.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. Consider prepaying medical expenses you're      anticipating, or have the work done now.</strong> After      December 31, 1986, the medical deduction threshold on      Schedule A will be increased from 5% to 7.5%.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. Make contributions before January 1,      1987.</strong> If you don't itemize deductions in 1987,      contributions won't be deductible. Even if you do itemize,      the deduction will be worth less because of lower marginal      tax rates. (Many people who previously did itemize won't      find it to their advantage in 1987.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. Make large purchases before the end of the      year.</strong> If you're planning to buy an automobile, an      airplane, a boat, or home construction materials, keep in      mind that as of January 1, sales tax isn't deductible.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6. Prepay consumer loan payments or      interest.</strong> Pay in December to the extent you're      financially able. As of the first, consumer interest won't      be deductible. If you can arrange with your lender to      prepay interest rather than principal, it will be further      to your advantage. (There's actually an interest phaseout:      35% is nondeductible in 1987, 60% in 1988, 80% in 1989, 90%      in 1990.)    </p>    <p>      After December 31, 1986, consider taking a second mortgage      to finance certain consumer credit purchases. Mortgage      interest will still be deductible, and you can offer a      second on your house as security.    </p>    <p>      Bear in mind, though, that mortgage interest will be      deductible only to the extent of the original cost of your      house plus improvements. If you borrow against its      appreciated value, that interest won't be deductible,      <em>unless</em> the funds are used for home improvement,      education, or medical expenses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. Consider paying for a five-year rental on your      safety deposit box.</strong> Storage of your financial      papers (old tax forms) won't be deductible after January 1,      1987.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. Make the maximum IRA contribution this      year.</strong> As of 1987, people with employer pension      plans will only be allowed a tax-deductible IRA if their      income is less than $35,000 single or $50,000 married. A      phaseout begins at $25,000 and $40,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9. If you've been considering buying rental      property, do so before January 1, 1987.</strong> As of that      date, the depreciation period for residential real property      is extended from 19 years to 27 1/2 years. Watch out for      passive loss restrictions if you're not managing the      property. An exception to the buy-now policy applies if      you're interested in buying or building low-income rental      housing. New credits may make this a taxshelter boon.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10.</strong> <strong>If you have high income, look      into forming a 401(k) retirement plan and making a large      contribution this year.</strong> If you have one already,      make the maximum contribution. Next year it will be limited      to $7,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11.</strong> <strong>If you have unused investment      tax credit carryover, it may be wise to take income in 1986      instead of 1987 to use the credits.</strong> This credit      will be reduced by 17.5% in 1987 and by 35% in 1988, and      will be eliminated in 1989.    </p>    <p>      <strong>12.</strong> <strong>Prepay your accountant's fees      (teehee).</strong> As of January 1, 1987, you're going to      need me more than ever, but my charges won't be deductible.    </p>
