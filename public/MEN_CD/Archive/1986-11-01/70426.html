                    <h5 id="byline">      by Tom Turner    </h5>		<h3>      Problems on the "Split Estate"    </h3>    <p>      An awkward situation exists on-and under-many      of the nation's 425 national wildlife refuges. When the      government acquired fully 80% of these areas-which it      did mainly to protect birds and their feeding and breeding      grounds-it did not at the same time acquire rights to      any oil, gas, coal, or other minerals that may exist      beneath the refuges. Why? The situation hasn't been      thoroughly investigated, but the reason appears to be a      combination of miserliness on the part of the feds and the      assumption that the mineral deposits, if acquired, would      eventually be leased back to commercial operators for      exploitation anyway.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the reason, the potential for conflict is obvious.      On the D' Arbonne National Wildlife Refuge in northeast      Louisiana, for example, the company that owns rights to the      gas beneath the refuge has flatly refused to abide by      regulations the Fish and Wildlife Service issued to control      surface damage. After a sticky series of lawsuits, a judge      ruled that the company is right. The government first      appealed but then backed down.    </p>    <p>      So for the moment the drilling company is free to blast its      way through delicate refuge lands, knocking down trees used      by endangered woodpeckers and playing hell with streams and      meadows. It's a problem crying for attention.    </p>    <h3>      What Post Office?    </h3>    <p>      The Presidio of San Francisco is a U.S. Army base that lies      within the Golden Gate National Recreation Area, a unit of      the national park system. Established in 1972, the GGNRA is      expected eventually to absorb the Presidio when the army no      longer needs the base.    </p>    <p>      So it came as a surprise last fall when a sign went up on      Crissy Field, an abandoned airstrip within the Presidio      next to San Francisco Bay, announcing that a brand-new post      office would soon rise on the site.    </p>    <p>      "Wait a minute," said Congresswoman Sala Burton, whose late      husband, Phillip, led the campaign to establish the GGNRA      when he was in Congress. Mrs. Burton tried to persuade the      army to stop construction and hold the public hearings it      had failed to call before breaking ground. The army      refused.    </p>    <p>      Next, the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed suit against      the army and the Postal Service. Two weeks later a federal      district judge ordered the army to halt construction,      finding that it had blatantly violated the law. That was on      Valentine's Day.    </p>    <p>      The last chapter was written July 16, when the army agreed      to raze the partly built post office and build several      other planned buildings well back from the bay in already      developed areas.    </p>    <h3>      Good Goin' Gators    </h3>        <p>      They haven't started nibbling yet at MOTHER's hometown of      Hendersonville, North Carolina (so far as we know), but all      over lower-lying parts of the Southeast American alligators      are making a remarkable comeback from the brink of      extinction.    </p>    <p>      In a breezy, early July press release ("Alligator Continues      Its Crawl Back to a Brighter Future"), the Department of      Interior announced that the gator was being reclassified      from "endangered" to "threatened by similarity of      appearance"-a unique category invented for the      alligator. It means that though the gator is considered      recovered, its hide so closely resembles that of related      species from South America and Africa that large-scale      hunting or trade in belts, shoes, and wallets will be      extremely hard to regulate. Should poaching begin again,      the alligator could be popped right back on the      endangered-species list without time-consuming hassles.    </p>    <p>      The good news covers areas in seven states where the gator      has made population gains of more than 1,000% over 10      years: Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North      Carolina, Oklahoma, and South Carolina.    </p>    <h3>      A Mineral Catch-22    </h3>    <p>      The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management are      taking an odd approach to lands of theirs that may have oil      or gas beneath them. Arguing that the mere signing of a      lease-a "paper transaction"-has no      environmental impact, the agencies refuse to conduct      environmental studies prior to selling exploration rights.      Trouble is, if oil or gas is subsequently found on the      tracts, the signed lease obliges the agencies to allow the      lease buyer to develop the property, even if doing so will      mess up streams, meadows, or forests ("inflict unacceptable      environmental damage," in bureaucratese).    </p>    <p>      Congress is finally taking a long-overdue look at this      problem, along with others that plague the leasing system,      including the "split estate" situation discussed earlier.      Environmentalists are supporting H.R. 4741, cosponsored by      Congressmen John Seiberling of Ohio and George Miller of      California.    </p>    <h3>      Golden Streams    </h3>    <p>      The gold-mining situation in Alaska hasn't changed much      since the gold rush of the last century.    </p>    <p>      Federal hard rock mining law (as opposed to the leasing law      mentioned above) virtually makes mining of gold and similar      minerals the highest use of any public land. In Alaska,      this has led to placer mining in streams in national parks      and elsewhere. There are regulations meant to protect      fisheries and scenery, but they have been lazily enforced      at best. Two lawsuits by the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund      have elicited stern warnings from the federal court in      Juneau, one of which stopped all mining on national parks      pending workable enforcement procedures. The other saw the      court, for the first time, order the Bureau of Land      Management to actually inspect the 300-odd mining      operations in its jurisdiction.    </p>    <h3>      Recommended Reading    </h3>    <p>      <em>Cadillac Desert</em> is an amazing account of the      development of the water resources of the western United      States. Lively, detailed, exciting, beautifully written,      and thorough almost to a fault, it describes just how      utterly the West relies on water transported over long      distances, how vulnerable it is to drought, and how bleak      the long-range prospects are. The West-as we know it,      anyway-is built on a mirage. <em>(Cadillac      Desert,</em> by Marc Reisner, Viking, 1986, $22.95.)    </p>    <p>      Tom Turner is a writer and editor who's been working in the      environmental field for 17 years. At present, he's with the      Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund, an independent      environmental law firm that represents many organizations      across the country. It is supported principally by private      donations. For more information, write Sierra Club Legal      Defense Fund, 2044 Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA 94115.    </p>
