                <p>      <strong>HOMESTEADING IN CANADA</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>TOM MARSHALL</strong>INNOVATOR, BOX 34718, LOS      ANGELES,CALIFORNIA 90034    </p>        <p>      For wilderness retreats or summer anchorages, an especially      attractive area is the North Coast of British Columbia - a      land of snow capped mountains, dense forests, rushing      streams and deep fjords. Its potential advantages include:    </p>    <p>      Ocean access: Myrian channels, arms and inlets – many      extending over 50 miles inland-provide more sea coast than      all of continental U.S. Among the almost endless inlets,      bays and islands are places a small boat could hide      indefinitely.    </p>    <p>      Geographical isolation: Rugged mountain ranges limit      transportation to water, which is slow, and air, which is      expensive. Only two roads and one railroad penetrate the      region.    </p>    <p>      Sparse population: The whole North Coast region (roughly      from Queen Charlotte Strait to the Alaska panhandle and      inland to the coastal divide)-larger than Ohio-has a      population of less than 40,000. Most of these people are      concentrated around the few cities. Arable land and      commercial timber exist only in small pockets in river      valleys and deltas, precluding large scale settlement.    </p>    <p>      In July and August of 1967, I explored some of the land and      waterways of this region. My route of travel was by      automobile to Bella Coola, then by kayak to Nascall Bay on      Dean Channel.    </p>    <p>      Although Bella Coola lies less than 300 miles from      Vancouver, the highway distance is 650 miles. I first drove      inland and north to Williams Lake, then northwest on a      fair-to-middling graded dirt road across the Fraser      Plateau. Separated from the ocean by mountains, this 3,000      foot highland has a climate quite different from the coast.      It's more like the higher plateaus of Colorado and Wyoming      with mild summers, cold winters and little precipitation.      The road to Bella Coola crosses gently rolling land, open      forests of lodgepole pine with some Douglas fir, spruce and      aspen and an occasional creek or lake. Cattle ranching is      the main industry. The few small settlements have a      "frontier" look: Log cabins, unpretentious yards and pole      fences.    </p>    <p>      After 250 miles of little variation, the land changes      abruptly as the road descends steeply – with several      switchbacks – to the Bella Coola valley. Within a few      miles, one plunges from the cool, open woods of the uplands      into a warmer, humid, dense jungle of giant arbor vitae and      Douglas fir. The road winds down the valley past a few      logging operations and guest lodges. Then, 20 miles from      sale water, the highway becomes paved and wilderness is      replaced by farms and homes that look long-settled.    </p>    <p>      Bella Coola contrasts with the rough and rustic interior      settlements, seeming (if one ignores the spectacular snow      capped peaks around it) more like a country town of the      U.S. south than the trading center for thousands of square      miles. The few businesses are scattered over a several      block area. Judging from the types of enterprises, tourism      is not an important industry.    </p>    <p>      Prices are surprisingly low, considering Bella Coola's      isolation and the small size of the market. A lunch consist      ing of ham sandwich, pie and milk cost $0.70, locally baked      bread sold for $0.26 a loaf and three pounds of powered      milk cost $1.40. (Prices are in Canadian dollars which      – at that time-exchanged for about 93 cents U.S.)      Gasoline cost $0.48 per Imperial gallon, equivalent to      about $0.37 U.S. per U.S. gallon.    </p>    <p>      My kayak was a 17-foot folding model which weighed 125      pounds complete with optional sloop sailing rig. I      transported it to Bella Coola disassembled (parts less than      five feet long), put it together on the banks of the river      above town and paddled down stream to the channel.    </p>    <p>      The trip from Bella Coola to Nascall Bay took five days.      Four days were consumed struggling the 18 miles down North      Bentinck Arm and Burke Channel against strong head winds      and often white-capped waves. I traveled these waters only      during the early morning when wind and waves were minimum.      Even then, hard paddling netted only one knot headway. An      attempt at upwind sailing in Burke Channel proved      unproductive; the Folbot will go into the wind reasonably      well in calm water but not when fighting three-foot waves.    </p>    <p>      Once beyond Bella Coola, the only signs of man were fishing      boats (about a dozen a day), a couple of logging operations      and the remains of piers, log booms and cabins in some of      the bays.    </p>    <p>      The shores are mostly low cliffs with some pebbly-to-rocky      beaches in the bays. On overnight stops I either dragged      the Folbot up a beach above the tidal zone (up to 15 feet)      or tied up offshore. One of the most attractive camping      places was a little cove (not shown on the land-status map)      just northeast of Lalakata Point. It was a near-ideal      combination of sandy beach, trickling creek and hillsides      covered with black raspberries and red bilberries.    </p>    <p>      On the fifth day I passed Mesachie Nose, turned into      Labouchere Channel and – for a change – had      calm water and a light tailwind. With mainsail alone I      ghosted downwind to Dean Channel and across on an easy      broad reach to Nascall Bay. Dean Channel was calmer than      Burke had been although a rain squall caused some rough      moments.    </p>    <p>      Half mile-long Nascall Bay has the shape of an hourglass      opened on one end. A boat can anchor in the back portion      out of sight of Dean Channel or the front. The Bay is      variously bordered by grassy, swampy and rocky beaches. In      one spot, there are even sheer cliffs.    </p>    <p>      Nascall Hot Springs lies near the mouth of the bay. About      ten years ago, according to reports, Crown Zellerbach      Corp., which has a large pulp mill at Ocean Falls 20 miles      to the west, surveyed Nascall Valley for hydroelectric      potential. The survey crew built a bathhouse: A shack whose      sole furnishing is a bathtub set into the floor. A pipe      runs back to the hot spring. Since its construction, the      bath has been used and maintained by passing pleasure and      fishing craft. During the three days I was in and around      the bay, at least a dozen boats stopped.    </p>   <h3> COMMENTS ON EQUIPMENT</h3>    <p>      The basic Folbot proved to be seaworthy, riding easily with      the largest non-breaking waves encountered. Under the same      conditions, 40-foot fishing boats pounded heavily. With a      waterproof kayak cover (which I lacked) to prevent      swamping, I would trust it on the open ocean in average      weather. However, the sailing gear has some design faults.      A small outboard motor (available as an option) would      facilitate cruising.    </p>    <p>      Hip boots are desirable for travel along rivers and through      swamps. A hand gun, although illegal in Canada, is much      easier to carry through the woods (for defense) than is a      rifle.    </p>    <p>      One sixteenth-inch netting will stop horse flies and      mosquitos but not the gnats which live on the coast (I      encountered none in the interior). Several layers of loose      clothing plus liberal and frequent applications of      repellant on exposed skin kept the bugs at bay during the      day. Insect pests are about as common as in more moist      portions of the U.S.    </p>    <p>      On my return trip I found a light northeast breeze down      Dean Channel and sailed across to Labouchere where I      encountered a light headwind: But, with calm water and a      following wind down the zigzag channel, I made good headway      with minimum tacking. When I reached Burke Channel, the      sails caught the prevailing southwest wind and the boat was      off racing the waves. Sometimes surfing on long swells for      a minute at a time and sometimes crashing through short      chop, the little craft ran before the wind.    </p>    <p>      At low elevations in the Bella Coola area, forest grows      everywhere except on naked rock, tidal flats and swamps      (any natural clearing) in a river valley will be marsh, not      dry grassland). Common trees include western hemlock, giant      arbor vitae, Sitka spruce, western white birch, Douglas      fir, yellow cypress and black cottonwood. Lodgepole pine      also grows on the more exposed slopes.    </p>    <p>      There is little undergrowth in the shade of some of the      denser stands of trees on delta lands. Elsewhere the      tanglefoot is heavy and includes young hemlock, bilberries,      ferns, mosses, smilacinas and – in wet spots –      devil's club. The rocks I noted were exclusively igneous      and many showed intrusions.    </p>    <p>      Blue and red bilberries, salmonberries and red and black      raspberries are abundant. The blue bilberry <em>(Vaccinium      ovalifolium Sm),</em> which makes up most of the      undergrowth in many places, is related to and bears fruit      shaped like blueberries. Blue bilberries are usually mildly      sweet but some bushes (which look no different) bear fruit      which tastes weedy or foul. Unlike raspberries, all      bilberries on a bush ripen together and remain edible for a      long time.    </p>    <p>      Plantain, fireweed, clover, ferns and the various conifers      are a few of the edible greens found near Bella Coola. The      only poisonous plants I noticed were water hemlock and      baneberries (a few in swampy areas).    </p>    <p>      Salmon were running in Dean Channel while I was there.      Mussels grow on some rocky beaches but, near large rivers,      the water is apparently too fresh. I did not see large game      animals (perhaps they move to higher ground in summer)      although a few squirrels were encountered.    </p>    <p>      Due to the highly irregular terrain, coastal British      Columbia shows great climatic variation and each river      valley, inlet or channel essentially has one or more local      climates. A few generalizations can be made (summers are      drier and sunnier than winters, precipitation usually      increases with elevation), but many anomalies remain.    </p>    <p>      For instance Bella Coola, at the head of an inlet, averages      55 inches of precipitation a year. Ocean Falls, 50 miles to      the west and also at the head of an inlet, averages 164      inches. Bella Bella, 30 miles still further west and on a      channel, receives 99 inches.    </p>    <p>      Judging from plant maturity and comments by local folk      (weather stations being few and far between), Dean Channel      has about the same summer weather as Bella Coola, but a      colder winter since it is more exposed to frigid northeast      winds from the interior.    </p>    <p>      One man said that the high precipitation and cloudiness at      Ocean Falls is a localized condition caused by the shape of      the valley. He reports that Ocean Falls will be overcast      and raining for days at a time while – eight miles      away in Dean Channel – the sun is shining.    </p>    <p>      During my visit in late July and early August, there were      stratus clouds in the early morning. They usually cleared      by afternoon. There was a build-up of cumulus clouds with      occasional rain squalls in late afternoon on a few days.      The channels tended to clear earlier and receive less rain      than the adjacent land. Temperatures did not exceed 85°      F nor fall below 50° F.    </p>    <p>      The most detailed map available* does not show terrain      features smaller than a quarter mile. Aside from that, only      a few discrepancies were noted including – if the map      be believed – a river which flows uphill (King      Island, about Lat. 52° 17' N, Long. 126° 27' W).      Perhaps this can be attributed to wishful thinking by the      government's Department of Lands, Forests and Water      Resources.    </p>    <p>      During my stay in Canada I was not molested by any large      animals, not even that most loathsome of predators –      the State bureaucrat. I camped out exclusively, both in the      wilderness and relatively settled areas.<br />    </p>    <p>      I spent ten days on rough waters in a conspicuously small,      open and unlicensed boat and my only noteworthy contacts      were with a few passing fishermen who solicitously asked if      everything was all right. No Canadian equivalent of the      Coasf Guard ordered me off the water (During a one-day      tryout of the Folbot on Piru Lake, Calif., I was ordered      out for not having registration and local permit.)    </p>        <p>      While many Canadian laws and regulations are as onerous as      their U.S. counterparts ON PAPER, enforcement in an area      with a population of less than one person per square mile      presents something of a problem for even the most      determined power seekers.    </p>    <p>      The Canadian government will not sell outright any      waterfront land. This is to "preserve it for recreational      use", of course, and poses no problem for the libertarian      nomad who intends to be only a squatter.<br />      <br />      <em>* Bella Coola, RC, sheet 93D, second status edition,      1962, Department of Lands, Forests and Water Resources,      Victoria, B.
