        		<p>	 <strong>GARDEN &YARD</strong>	</p> 	      <p>      Addressing a group of Nobel Prize winners, President Kennedy announced, "I think this is the      most extraordinary collection of talent, of human      knowledge, that has ever been gathered together at the      White House--with the possible exception of when Thomas      Jefferson dined here alone." Though the audience      appreciated the humorous remark, a description of Jefferson      in the simple act of eating would indeed have shown a      prodigious mind at work.</p><p> Jefferson ate vegetables, peas in      particular, from all corners of the world. Dining alone      gave him the opportunity to make copious notes of his own      horticultural experiments. "I have often thought," he wrote      in 1811, "that if heaven had given me choice of my position      and calling, it should have been a rich spot of earth, well      watered, and near a good market for the productions of the      garden. No occupation is so delightful to me as the culture      of the earth..."</p><p> When other obligations kept him away from      Monticello, his home in the Virginia Piedmont, Jefferson      would use free time to draw up plans for his garden and      conduct a worldwide correspondence on matters      horticultural. While serving as George Washington's      secretary of state, he traded exotic seeds with the      president, and the two forefathers spent hours discussing      their experiments. On May 12, 1826, in the last entry      published in his exhaustive <em>Garden Book</em> and only a      month and a half before his death at 83, Jefferson wrote a      brief letter requesting the consignment of a missing box of      exotic French seeds, "...the sooner the better as the      season is fast advancing."</p><p> By the time of Jefferson's      death, the orchards and gardens at Monticello formed the      vanguard of fruit and vegetable research in the South, if      not the entire nation. This scientific juggernaut had its      origins in a simple observation. On March 30,1766,      Jefferson, 22, opened his <em>Garden Book</em> with the      following note: "Purple hyacinth begins to bloom." Once      turned on, his eye caught almost every change in the      environment, and whatever he saw rarely escaped being      recorded. Over the next 60 years, notes, letters,      instructions, and requests flowed and tumbled over each      other in the book. The man's mind could not be quieted.</p><p> His      gardens are still meticulously maintained to this day.</p><p>      --Douglass Lea    </p>
