            		<p>			 <strong>LAST LAUGH</strong>		</p> 		   		<p>				<em><strong>At peace with a pest.</strong></em> 		</p>		<h5 id="byline">				<em>By Josephine Ligon</em>    </h5>            <p>      People have fed ants such an assortment of delicacies and      co ndiments that they have developed very educated taste      buds.</p><p> We should stop encouraging them. We should remember      that ants are fickle</p><p>. Just the other day, I visited friends      and I could barely reach the doorbell because they had an      inch-wide trail of pepper before the door that was supposed      to keep ants away.</p><p> Whatever happened to doormats that say,      "Welcome"?    </p>        <p>      I'm not sure, because I didn't have my glasses on, but I      think the ants marching around held little placards saying      they were going to call in reinforcements from an ant      colony with a pepper culture that would eat right through      it. Or maybe they said they were negotiating for the pepper      to be topped with pork rinds.</p><p> It doesn't matter. When ants      start carrying signs you know they're serious.</p><p> One man I      know unloads a box of kosher salt around his sink. He says      kosher salt reminds the ants of mountain climbing, and      apparently most of them are into it in a big way, because      they keep climbing up and down over the chunks and leave      his food alone.</p><p> Another friend tries to ward them off by      putting slices of cucumber all over the place.    </p>        <p>      There are over three thousand different kinds of ants, and      there have been times when I think they all called a      convention in my kitchen.</p><p> Once I tried to annihilate an      army of ants by sticking cloves in every crevice of the      house. That got rid of them for one season. However, the      very next year those ants developed a taste for cloves.      They ate them up like appetizers on the way to raid my      cupboards.</p><p> Mary Ellen's <em>Best</em> of <em>Helpful</em>      <em>Hints</em> suggests using a chalk line to keep the ants      away.She doesn't really tell you that it works. She simply      tells you to see for yourself.</p><p> Heloise says to sprinkle      talcum powder about, if you want your crop of ants to      disappear.    </p>        <p>      When you have such an assortment of ants coming to dinner,      it's like inviting vegetarians and cattle ranchers to the      same spread. You can't please them all or discourage them      all.</p><p> There's no one thing that will send all ants off to      ant heaven, and you can't just put them all into a blender      and have them come out with a common appetite.</p><p> Some folks      say you can pour boiling water over an ant hill, and it's      supposed to kill them.</p><p> I went and borrowed three more tea      kettles from neighbors and boiled water on four burners one      day. Then I poured it over ant hills.</p><p> The next day, I found      all the ants in my part of the country had gathered      together to mourn the victims. They had taken up permanent      residence in the homes of the deceased.    </p>        <p>      Of course, for all I know, I had just drowned out the most      obvious ant motels and had missed some elegant ant haven in      the woods. Ant hills aren't easy to find.</p><p> "Go to the ant, O      sluggard," says the Bible, Proverbs: 6:6. "Consider her      ways and be wise."</p><p> They've had us buying ant farms and      studying them for years.</p><p> We've found out that they greet      one another with a pat of their antennae and talk to each      other. When I see a whole string of ants on the counter, I      figure they must have been exchanging favorable comments on      the kind of food we serve.</p><p> A young friend who has an ant      farm can't see why anyone would try to get rid of ants.    </p>        <p>      <br />      "They're a lot cleaner than Peter is," she said, looking      down at her little brother. "Peter never washes his face or      his hands or anything. Ants clean their antennae all the      time. I'll bet if you don't keep your kitchen clean that an      ant wouldn't even want to come in."</p><p> I laughed. "You mean if      I put enough dirt and jam around, ants wouldn't want to      come in?"</p><p> Her expression grew wise. "Ants clean and brush      themselves with their antennae when they leave, because      they know that houses have sticky boys like Peter It's      weird stuff that keeps them away.</p><p> "Like what?" I asked.</p><p>      "Only the ants know," she whispered, going out the door.    </p>        <p>      Lately I've realized my ants have gone away. It might have      had something to do with the fact that about two months      ago, I squirted caulk into every crevice I could find.</p><p> On      the other hand, maybe I better spruce the place up. If ants      don't come in, there might be something eerie lurking      about.</p><p> Perhaps a bit of poison is slowly killing us all.      Maybe radioactive dust that only an ant's antennae can      discover is filtering in, doing us harm.</p><p> Where are those      ants that made me know that my kitchen had food in it that      was safe to eat?</p><p> There's something about ants in the      kitchen that gives me peace of mind!    </p>
