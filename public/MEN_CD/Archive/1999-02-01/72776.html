            			<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>              <p>      A decade ago, due to budget constraints as well as a      natural penchant for wanting to be self-sufficient and      thrifty, I started searching for some inexpensive, easily      made herbal therapies. The primary recipe whose      effectiveness has stood the test of time is my herbal      liniment. We use it most often for sore muscles and any      kind of cut or skin eruption. It also works for athlete's      foot. Apply frequently, saturating the affected area      thoroughly. (If dripped on clothing, it's yellow color      usually washes out.) The liniment can be kept in the      refrigerator to be used as a cold poultice for withdrawing      heat from an inflamed area. Just saturate a clean, soft      cloth and apply frequently. For a hot poultice, soak a      cloth with liniment, put it in a bowl, and microwave for      one minute. Apply often, to relax spasms from sore muscles      and joints.</p><p> I have heard that this liniment is helpful for      arthritis. Also, one friend told me that it's the only      thing that brings her son relief from fire ant bites, to      which he is highly allergic. Evidently, it works better      than his prescription medication.</p><p><br /> My most dramatic      personal experiment was with sore throats and mouth sores.      Let me say at the outset, this stuff tastes vile! For small      mouth sores or toothaches, you can dab it on with a cotton      swab or rub it on, but for sore throats, what really works      best is the tough-minded approach. Pour a tablespoon or so      in your mouth and swish it around the affected area and      spit it out. I could not believe how fast it works.</p><p> A word      of caution: do <em>not</em> swallow the liniment! It      contains rubbing alcohol and is not to be ingested. And      don't get it in your eyes.    </p>    <p>      The recipe couldn't be simpler.    </p>    <h3>      Combine:    </h3>    <p>      1 oz. powdered myrrh (an excellent astringent)    </p>    <p>      1/2 oz. powdered goldenseal (has anti-inflammatory and      antibacterial properties)    </p>    <p>      1/4 oz. cayenne pepper (powerful stimulant and astringent)    </p>    <p>      1 pint rubbing alcohol    </p>    <p>      Mix together and let stand seven days. Shake well every      day. You can strain the liniment through damp cheesecloth      if you don't like the gritty feel of ground herbs. If you      leave the herbs in, it gets even stronger. If you don't      have goldenseal, make the liniment without it.</p><p> Check around      for the prices of herbs. I found one place that was      charging $179 a pound for goldenseal! In such a case, I      would definitely make it without this herb, or else put in      just a fraction of an ounce. At today's prices, it should      cost about $2 to $3 to make a pint of the liniment, if you      buy alcohol when it is 35C a pint.</p><p> I put a label on mine      that lists the ingredients and the following suggestions:      "Good for all pains, swellings, bruises, skin eruptions of      all kinds. If possible, apply every few minutes for an hour      or two. Useful for headaches. Apply to temples, back of      heck, and forehead. For sore throat, gargle with -a small      amount and spit out. Do not swallow. For toothache or mouth      sores, rub on or use cotton swab. Apply frequently to      athlete's foot. Do riot get in eyes."</p><p> <em>--Susan Marie      Wyman</em><br />      <em>Canton, Georgia</em>    </p>
