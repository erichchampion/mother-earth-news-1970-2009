                <p>      Orillia, Ontario design architect Peter Fluker used ol' Sol      in style when he constructed . . .    </p>        <p>      As "alternative" sources of energy have become more widely      accepted, passively heated and cooled houses have received      plenty of attention, and for several good reasons: They're      often elementary in design and function, generally require      a minimum of maintenance, and depend very little (if at      all!) on the more conventional energy sources.    </p>    <p>      And, partly as a result of the fact that a "sun powered"      structure is its own heating and cooling "system", most      passive dwellings represent a fine balance between cost      effectiveness and the aesthetic appeal of building a home      that complements its natural surroundings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STRIVING FOR BALANCE WITH THE ENVIRONMENT</strong>    </p>        <p>      The Peter Fluker residence, located 90 miles north of      Toronto in Canada's Ontario province, provides a fine      example of the favorable blend of comfortable, attractive      living space with energy efficiency. Because "only"      two-thirds of the building's heating requirements are taken      care of by the sun (in a climate that experiences 8,500      heating degree-days annually), it can't be considered      completely solar self-sufficient, but then few naturally      tempered homes are as yet . . . and this "shortcoming" is      certainly compensated for by the outdoor-like atmosphere of      the structure.    </p>    <p>      In planning his family home, you see, Fluker-a design      architect by profession-strongly felt that the      dwelling should embody the concept that people and their      residences ought to be integral parts of, rather than      intrusions into, the surrounding environment.    </p>    <p>      To accomplish this, Peter spent a good deal of time      studying the local terrain and designing the building so      that each feature represents a response to its      surroundings. By taking advantage of the site's physical      char acteristics, then, he was able to let the land do its      share in making his home a functional success.    </p>        <p>      The house's several-acre lot is well isolated from the road      by a generous stand of deciduous trees growing on a gentle      southfacing slope. This foliage provides shading in the      summer season, yet is developed enough to allow any breeze      to reach the structure by passing beneath its umbrella of      leaves.    </p>    <p>      The house itself stands at the peak of the slope and is      bermed to the north. To further augment the effect of this      earth sheltering, the designer shaped his home's      cedar-shingled roof to direct winds away from the      dwelling's south-facing skylight area. (The structure was      laid out as a modified pentagon . . . both to encourage      airflow and to make efficient use of its southern      exposure.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMBINING BEAUTY AND FUNCTION</strong>    </p>    <p>      Fluker's design is intentionally uncomplicated: He planned      a direct-gain, passive solar structure with 1,750 square      feet of living area, all told. Over half the main floor is      directly exposed to the sun . . . either through the 186      square feet of south-south-east-to south-southwest-oriented      glass, or through the 360 square feet of skylight collector      surface. The master bedroom on the upper level is bathed in      light both indirectly (from white-painted ceilings and      walls) and straightaway (through the roof section of the      skylight).    </p>        <p>      On the other hand, the triple-glazed window area on the      home's north, east, and west faces was kept to a total of      only 70 square feet, and is responsible for less than 9% of      the building's total heat loss.    </p>    <p>      In order to provide for energy absorption and      storage-while adhering to the concept that the      Structure should be a storage medium in itself-the      designer incorporated several systems into his creation.    </p>    <p>      To begin with, the slab was poured over an insulated (R-16)      bed, which includes an airhandling system. The surface of      this concrete foundation was fitted out with dark,      heatabsorbing slate in the solarium, hearth, and kitchen      areas . . . but-because the owner felt that a softer      material would provide a warmer, cozier      feeling-carpeting was installed in most of the      remaining living space.    </p>    <p>      Then, to take advantage of direct solar gain (and to      provide a structural as well as an aesthetic focus), a      concrete block column, veneered with slabs of charcoal-gray      slate, reaches from floor to ceiling at the center of the      house.    </p>        <p>      The pillar's function isn't simply to absorb heat. It also      serves as a chimney for a Fisher woodstove, and houses a      central duct that's connected to the air-handling network      encased in the slab. By constantly using the low-speed fan      in the backup electric furnace duct for cold-season      circulation, Fluker was able to create a flow loop that      pulls stagnant air from the peak of the building (where it      gathers naturally) . . . into a vent at the top of the      central column . . . and on through the concealed duct and      into those in the system beneath the floor.    </p>    <p>      In this fashion, both the "conventional" backup and the      solar heating systems are integrated, since any convective      warmth from either the woodstove or the furnace must travel      through the storage mass . . . and the Fisher's radiant      heat is also absorbed directly by the masonry from the      outside. Moreover, the warm-air distribution system reduces      temperature differences between the high and low levels of      the house, and-since the floor is constantly heated      from beneath-the effects of any loss of direct solar      gain that result from the use of carpeting are diminished      to a significant degree. Finally, to insulate the      structural package, Peter protected the walls and roof to a      factor of R32.    </p>        <p>      Of course, the Canadian residence was also designed to      passively fend off the effects of summer's higher      temperatures . . . and this was done, for the most part, as      naturally as possible. The greenhouse floor is vented to      the exterior at ground level, and-because a      lowpressure cell is created within the structure by      prevailing wind flow over it-cool air from the forest      bed is drawn into the house at that point and pulled upward      . . . to eventually pass out of the structure through a row      of clerestory windows high in the master bedroom's north      wall.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, although the huge skylight is somewhat      protected from insolation by the surrounding summer      foliage, this shading is not so pronounced during warm      periods immediately before and after that sea son. So, to      subdue the sun's rays through the spring and fall months,      the designer may install a motorized shutter system on the      ceiling beams. This should not only prevent unwanted      sunlight from entering the house, but also greatly improve      the structure's ability to retain warmth when the skylight      is "closed off" at night.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A SHINING SUCCESS</strong>    </p>            <p>      Since completing his residence in 1979, Peter Fluker has      spent a good deal of time analyzing the structure's      strengths and weaknesses. And considering the harshness of      the Canadian climate, he feels that his objective-the      creation of a functional, attractive living space that      taxes conventional energy sources as little as      possible-has been successfully met.    </p>    <p>      Fluker's project has been a success when considered from a      dollars-and- cents aspect, as well: His current heating      requirements are 10 million BTU annually, which translates      into a full-year expenditure of only $162 in U.S. funds.      Building costs, on the other hand, figured to about $46 per      square foot, which compares favorably with most dwellings      constructed in the States at the time.    </p>    <p>      So, judging from this northern example, one can see that      "going solar" is definitely progressive. After all, getting      more from lessand doing it in style-is what it's all      about!    </p>    <p>      EDITORS NOTE: The Peter Fluker Group is an Ontario-based      organization involved in passive solar design and      analysis/retrofit of existing structures.
