                    <h5 id="byline">      by Mary Jo Churchwell    </h5>    <p>      <strong><em>Patience and care create a very special Rocky      Mountain homestead.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>This year marks the 20th anniversary of</em> <em>MOTHER      EARTH NEWS.</em> <em>We think it appropriate to open the      year with a success story that springs directly from the      roots of our publication. Perhaps there aren't many people      who would want to duplicate the Churchwells'great escape,      but all of us, regardless</em> <em>of</em><em>the level of      our current commitment to country</em> <em>life,</em> can      find entertainment and inspiration in their story.    </p>    <p>      -The Editors    </p>            <p>      <strong>ONCE UPON A TIME, WE-LIKE SO</strong> many      others-were trapped in a lifestyle that didn't bring us      pleasure. Worse yet, we were actively working at jobs we      hated in order to finance our entrapment.    </p>    <p>      "Why can't we use some of our weekend activities that do      bring us fulfillmenthunting, gardening, carpentry-to build      a home and live off the land in the nearby mountains?" said      we to us. So we stopped dreaming and started scheming. The      result?    </p>    <p>      For the past four years, our family has lived under      nature's jurisdiction in a remote setting high in the Idaho      Rockies. Despite isolation, arctic cold, and snow that      sometimes reaches our belt buckles, we are now self      sufficient, thriving, and happy.    </p>    <h3>Looking Back</h3>    <p>      Our grand plan was to first stockpile enough money to buy      property and construct a cabin. After purchasing the land      we would continue to work and save until our bank balance      could earn sufficient interest to provide a small      income-enough to handle low monthly living expenses as well      as the larger items such as property taxes, truck repairs,      and auto insurance. We intended to reach a point where we'd      never have to work for salaries again.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"Since we wanted no power poles polluting our      scenery, we gladly eliminated the television, hair dryer,      and popcorn popper from our lives."</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      For five grueling years we saved most of our paychecks. The      fact that we were able to live on $300 a month during that      period is an indication of the level of our commitment.      When our finances gave us the goahead for the land, we      visited the local realtor. He claimed to have just the      place for us and pointed us in the general direction: "Go      up from the highway on the Forest Service road for 15      miles. Watch the curves and straddle the ruts. Park your      car at Sawmill Crick. Then follow the trail a mile to the      realty sign. Good luck, and, oh, wear your snowshoes."    </p>    <p>      We fell in love with the place at first sight. By noon the      following day we had paid cash (there would be no more      buying on credit in our lives) for five acres of hillside,      meadow, and forest. Once the snow melted, we discovered      that the "road" to our mountain land consisted of two deep      tire ruts made interesting by a difficult creek crossing.      So we bought (for cash) a used four-wheel-drive      "creek-Grosser." Besides providing basic transportation,      this workhorse was soon called upon to shuttle building      materials dumped off by the delivery trucks. The three days      spent transporting 1,300 cinder blocks back to our homesite      were just a small part of the price we paid for seclusion.    </p>    <h3>Building Begins</h3>    <p>      While frantically working and saving, we spent our weekends      and vacations building. First, we put up a fence to keep      out range cattle and horses. Next, we constructed a work      shed and a storage but for tools, building supplies, and      all our worldly goods. We also bought a 16-foot travel      trailer to house us until our home was completed. And since      we wanted no power poles polluting our scenery, we held a      yard sale and gladly eliminated the television, hair dryer,      and popcorn popper from our lives. Finally, the day arrived      when we were able to quit our jobs. We moved into the      trailer and onto our meadow, where we became full-time      modern "homesteaders"; even then, though, it took another      three years before our log cabin was livable. During that      time, we weren't able to stay in the trailer much after the      first snow fell, so we hitched it to the truck and spent      those winters traveling throughout the sunny Southwest. By      limiting our sight-seeing and staying at free campgrounds,      we explored a wonderful chunk of America and kept within      our budget.    </p>        <h3>Our Lodge of Logs</h3>    <p>      We wanted our home to harmonize with its mountain      environment. Logs were the obvious choice for wall      construction, both for aesthetics and because of their      availability and insulating qualities. Furthermore, log      structures are capable of withstanding an amazing amount of      stress-a good quality in an area with heavy snows and a      somewhat shaky reputation (a 1983 earthquake there left two      persons dead and damage that ran into the millions).    </p>    <p>      We originally planned to cut and haul our own logs out of      the nearby forests of lodgepole pines. But, not having a      logging truck, we found it more practical to contract with      a local lumberjack to have the eightinch timbers delivered.      Even that was much less expensive than purchasing ordinary      milled logs.    </p>    <p>      Although the timbers had been peeled and then allowed to      dry for a year, we knew they'd still undergo some settling      and shrinkage. We designed our home to accommodate this.      The window and door frames are <em>keyed</em> into the logs      rather than fastened securely. And the pillars supporting      the ridgepole of the roof are mounted on jacks at their      bases, underneath the floor. These jacks can be let down;      thus we've lowered the ridgepole as the walls have shrunk      and settled. Interior walls, counters, and cupboards are      freestanding and likewise keyed into the walls. Six months      after the shell was completed, we measured and found the      walls had settled an average of threeeighths of an inch.    </p>    <p>      Keeping the cold winter climate in mind, we spared no      expense on insulation. Teninch fiberglass batts went      beneath the floor and an eight-inch blanket into the      ceiling. In addition, large south-facing windows invite the      low winter sun into the house, and a greenhouse is attached      to the southern wall. Any cloudless January day can heat      the greenhouse to 70°F.    </p>    <p>      The subzero winters presented another problem. While wood      floors were practical for the living room and bedrooms, we      knew they'd be difficult to keep clean in the kitchen, and      we learned that vinyl-type flooring wasn't guaranteed      against extreme cold. A floor of local slate, which we were      able to gather ourselves from the nearby talus slopes, was      the solution. Even though we lacked masonry experience, a      bit of study and research on our part, along with extensive      coaching from the local mason, enabled us to lay a floor      that's practical, durable, and attractive.    </p>    <p>      As to plumbing, we weren't eager to fight frozen pipes at      minus 45°F. So, since we enjoy backwoods simplicity      anyway, we chose to eliminate the dubious advantage of      running water, which put a conventional toilet out of the      picture. Unfortunately, we had no good location for an      outhouse.    </p>    <p>      We hit the books again to research composting toilets. The      manufactured one we wanted was so expensive that we built      our own of plywood and 4 X 4s, had it sprayed with      fiberglass at a camper-shell factory, and placed it in its      own minibasement.    </p>    <p>      Because we live at 45° latitude, our short winter days      provided another challenge. We didn't <em>want</em> to go      to bed at four in the afternoon, so we installed a number      of propane gas lights, which brighten up our long months of      darkness for only $40 worth of fuel a season.    </p>    <h3>Gardening on High</h3>    <p>      Once we'd moved into our rustic cottage, the next order of      business was the food supply. Our high-altitude garden      (elevation, 6,700 feet) would have to survive through a      growing season with <em>no</em> traditional frost-free      period. (In fact, we can expect tomatokilling cold, as well      as snow, during any month of the summer.)    </p>    <p>      Again we did our research and planted only hardy,      frost-resistant varieties. We didn't even consider growing      corn and zucchini, and the greenhouse handles the tomatoes      and peppers. All of our study has paid off. We've harvested      beets, carrots, onions, garlic, lettuce, spinach, turnips,      radishes, kohlrabi, horseradish, and Jerusalem artichokes.      And the strawberries, raspberries, rhubarb, and bush      cherries are thriving.    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>"Although flatland farmers can      grow</em></strong> <em><strong>more bountiful gardens, we      have the advantage of being able to add game animals to our      larder,"</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      Nowadays we have the time to supplement our garden produce      by foraging for wild edibles throughout the year. Purple      currantsfrom which we make delicious jellygrow all around      us. Wild strawberries edge the meadows and are sweeter than      any cultivated variety. We steam dandelion greens and      stinging nettles and are lavish with the butter. During our      cross-country ski trips, we pick vitamin C-packed rose hips      for tea, being careful to leave plenty for the critters who      depend on this winter food supply.    </p>    <h3>A-Hunting We Will Go</h3>    <p>      Although flatland farmers can grow more bountiful gardens,      we have the advantage of being able to add game animals to      our larder. In fact, deer, elk, and bear constitute the      bulk of our meat supply, and we aren't burdened with      nursing livestock through cold, snowy winters. This      economical source of calories costs us little more than $64      a year in license fees and tags, which permit us two elk,      two deer, and a bear-way too much meat for our family and      more than we'd ever take! We have no gasoline expense,      because the truck stays home. We backpack to our hunting      area right from the house and set up camp for a month;      and-because our hunting, though enjoyable, is part of the      business of survival and not mere sport-our success rate      approaches 100%70.    </p>    <p>      After a beast is field-dressed, it's quartered and packed      home on our backs. Very little is left behind for the      coyotes.    </p>    <p>      So what do we do with all that time we <em>don't</em> have      to spend milking cows and slopping hogs? You'll find us      backpacking to the many nearby lakes, fishing the summer      away.    </p>    <h3>Dealing With Isolation</h3>    <p>      We live 25 miles from a one-doctor town and 175 miles from      the nearest Big Mac, and our truck hibernates in a den of      snow for six months each year. So obviously we don't run      down to the corner grocer for a cup of flour. In fact, this      level of isolation calls for copious listmaking. We make      one trip a month to town during the summer for library      books, laundering, and small purchases. Once a year we      travel to the city for supplies. All of our grains and      beans come from a single annual order from a food co-op, so      we try to obtain as much as possible at that time (see      sidebar). Since these items will keep, we prefer to      overorder rather than be caught short in winter. When items      are overlooked or underordered, we try to improvise.      Mailorder catalogs offer another means of making up for      mistakes. (We do get mail, delivered-by snowmobile in      winter-a mile from the house, three times a week.) When all      else fails, well, it's amazing what one can do without.    </p>    <p>      A more serious aspect of our isolation is the possibility      of a medical emergency during our snowed-in phase, when      professional treatment would involve a 10mile crosscountry      ski trip to our nearest neighbor and, from there, a fair      drive on the plowed road to town. Therefore, when      snowbound, we try to eliminate all accidentmakers (such as      the chain saw) from our lives. But <em>should</em> a finger      get carved instead of a roast, we can run to our      industrialstrength first-aid kit for sutures, antibiotics,      and prescription painkillers.    </p>    <h3>Churchwell School for Boys</h3>    <p>      Snow-trapped as we are all winter, people often ask, "How      do the kids get to school?" This leads to our favorite      success story. We've been home-schooling our two boys (ages      12 and 14) for the past four years. To comply with Idaho      law, we use standard textbooks. But because of the one      studentone teacher advantage, a year's formal education is      usually completed in four months. Then the boys are free to      really learn.    </p>    <p>      Without television, their idle time is spent reading      everything from <em>National Geographic</em> to <em>The      Grapes of Wrath.</em> House construction and furniture      building-mathematics in action-become woodshop classes. And      rebuilding the truck engine doubles as auto mechanics.      Because their time isn't monopolized by the classroom, the      boys are free to investigate nearby meadows and ponds.    </p>    <p>      Field guides on birds, bugs, and flowers are packed with      their lunches. And since hunting is a family affair,      gutting a deer becomes an anatomy lesson.    </p>    <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>    <p>      This is not the end of our story. We're still learning and      growing into independence. Next year we'll try beekeeping.      And we sometimes wonder if we couldn't go back to a horse      and buckboard for all our transportation needs!    </p>    <p>      There will, of course, continue to be problems and      solutions and compromises and even (gasp!) failures. No      lifestyle comes with a guarantee. Each is equipped with its      own set of difficulties. Our headaches are unique to us,      though, and we'll deal with them in our own way. But      there's one lesson we've learned that has been a sort of      golden rule: Success in homesteading comes from molding a      lifestyle around an area's resources and maintaining      respect for the environment's limitations.    </p>    <h3>A YEAR'S SUPPLIES</h3>    <p>      <strong>HERE'S THE BASIC SHOPPING LIST</strong> for our      family of four: 50 pounds each: wheat berries (for sprouts      and cereal), dried whole corn (ground for cereal, etc.),      wheat bran, bulgur wheat, cornmeal, short-grain brown rice,      barley flakes, black turtle beans, garbanzo beans, great      northern beans, kidney beans, baby white limas, navy beans,      pinto beans, blackeyed peas, green split peas, green      lentils; 25 pounds each: pearled barley, popcorn, rye      flour; 250 pounds regular rolled oats; 700 pounds whole      wheat flour; 20 pounds each: linguini, spaghetti noodles,      vermicelli, pasta shells; 5 pounds dry active yeast; 2      gallons mayonnaise; 100 pounds sugar; 60 pounds salt (some      of this is for corning venison); 8 gallons syrup; 1 gallon      mustard; 24 pounds dried milk; 4 gallons each: vinegar,      vegetable oil; 4 pounds baking soda (used for baking and      brushing teeth); 24 ounces coffee; 16 ounces Postum (a      healthful coffee substitute); 1 roll each: plastic wrap,      foil, freezer bags, freezer wrap, paper towels; 2 cases      toilet paper; 3 quarts dishwashing detergent; 10 pounds      laundry detergent; 1 case kitchen matches; 2 gallons      shampoo.    </p>
