                <p>      <strong>HERBALIST'S NOTEBOOK</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Corinne Martin    </h5>        <p>      <strong><em>Raspberry</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      It is 5 A.M. and I'm hoping to foil the bugs and get home      before the heat starts up again. Along the last bend in the      road-where the surface is still soil rather than      asphalt-raspberry grows right up to the cleared      roadway. It is tall and full of fruit, and I pop a few      juicy berries in my mouth as I pick. Bullfrogs twang, and      the birds I've disturbed start up again. Quietly I continue      gathering.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Description:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Raspberry is a prickly stemmed, spreading plant that bears      edible fruit common to roadsides, thickets, and disturbed      areas. Several species are indigenous to the Northeast. The      wild red raspberry, <em>Rubus idaeus,</em> is common to      roadsides and clearings and is the official raspberry of      herbal tradition. Raspberry leaves are alternate and      divided, with three to five sharply and irregularly toothed      leaflets. They are bright green, often with whitish      undersides, and occur along a stiff, prickly stem. These      stems are often arched and form dense thorny thickets.      Plants may grow as high as six or seven feet, and      raspberry's flowers are white or cream-colored, with five      regular petals. (The petals and sepals are roughly the same      length.) Blossoms, approximately 1/2" wide, appear in late      spring and early summer. The raspberry's fruit is a soft,      multi-segmented berry that is edible (more than just      edible-delicious!) and ripens in mid-to late summer.      The berries are juicy and sweet, with fleshy fruit      surrounding many seeds; they make wonderful wild jams,      jellies, and syrups.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Medicinal Uses:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Raspberry leaves are astringent and tonic, and have a      special affinity for tissues of the female reproductive      system. A tea of raspberry leaves helps tone the muscles of      the uterus and has been used for centuries to prepare the      system for childbirth. Raspberry tea can also be used to      reduce heavy menstrual bleeding and, in general, to tone      and normalize the reproductive system's functions.      Raspberry leaves and root bark can be used, too, to help      control diarrhea, because its astringency effectively tones      inflamed or irritated tissues. In this case, other species      of raspberry can be used interchangeably, because all share      the same properties of astringency. (If your diarrhea      persists, of course, you should always call your doctor for      a checkup.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvesting:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Wear thick protective gloves when gathering raspberry. Cut      leaves from stems whenever the plant is in full growth, and      especially when it's flowering. Handle carefully and spread      to dry on screens, baskets, or paper bags. To use the root      bark, dig up medi um-size plants after leafy material has      died during the fall. Wash roots carefully and strip off      the outer bark. Spread out to dry on screens or baskets,      and store when dry. To help control di arrhea, cut bark      strips into small pieces for tea, or place powdered herb in      a blender and mix with honey.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dosages:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Raspberry is water soluble and works fine as an infusion.      Use one teaspoon of chopped dried leaves per one cup of      boiling water, steep five to 10 minutes, and drink two or      three times daily. A tincture, made from the fresh or dried      leaves, can be added to other herbs that are used to aid      the female reproductive system, such as squawvine and      motherwort. To use the root bark for diarrhea, simmer one      teaspoon of root in 1 1/2 cups of water for 10 minutes;      strain and drink every two hours.    </p>        <p>      <strong>Sweet Fern</strong>    </p>    <p>      Down by the development road, there's a cleared area where      trees were taken down. However, it is now starting to      become lush with bright new growth. The breeze blows      wonderful s cents-pine, dew-covered earth, and the      strong, deep, heady smell of sweet fern. As I start to      gather leaves, I find deer tracks and figure that the deer      must come down here at night, after the construction      <em>crew has left and all is quiet, to stand like I do now,      looking at all the changes. l imagine that they make new      plans, or maybe they just wait, like I do, to see how much      the development changes things. Maybe they can adapt. l      worry for them, though.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Description:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Sweet fern is a low growing, deciduous shrub that is      extremely aromatic when crushed. It is generally found in      dry soil along roadsides and in fields along the edges of      forest land. Sweet fern's leaves are alternate and occur      along stiff, woody stems. The leaf margins are wavy and      fernlike (hence the name), and the dark green leaves, which      grow as long as six inches, feel somewhat oily when      crushed. Sweet fern bears fruit in the form of a bristly,      light-green seed capsule that can be found on the plant in      the fall. Plants grow as tall as five feet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Medicinal Uses:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Externally, sweet fern has been used to relieve itching and      irritation from skin conditions such as poison ivy, general      rashes, insect bites, and shingles. Fresh leaves can also      be crushed and rubbed onto the skin to keep away insects      for a short period of time. Internally, sweet fern acts as      a stringent and is useful for mild diarrhea, stomach      cramps, and indigestion. It's also useful as a mouthwash to      help relieve gum inflammations and mouth sores. Not much      more is presently known about sweet fern's actions because      it hasn't yet been studied intensively. It has, however,      had repeated use in folklore remedies in the Northeast.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Harvesting:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Cut the plant's leafy twigs any time during its growing      season, spring through early fall. Remove individual leaves      from the twigs, and dry by spreading them out on screens or      other appropriate material. Or, bundle the leafy twigs to      dry, and strip the dried leaves for storage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dosages:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Externally, a strong tea of sweet-fern leaves can be      applied to the affected areas of skin on clean cloth      several times a day. If a whole-body rash is evident, fill      a bathtub with the strong tea, and soak your body for 20      minutes several times a day. Internally, you can ingest a      tea made with one rounded teaspoon of dried leaves to one      cup of boiling water. Steep the tea for 10 minutes and      drink several times a day.    </p>    <p>      Editor's note: Corinne Martin, a graduate of the Institute      of Traditional Herbal Medicine in Santa Fe, NM, is a      certified clinical herbalist who has studied plants for      over a decade.
