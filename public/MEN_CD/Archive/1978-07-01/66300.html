                        <h5 id="byline">      by JOYCE BEADLES    </h5>    <hr />    <p>      The Terry Beadles family of Michigan knows how to get from      middle-income, middleclass America ... to Middle Earth.      Just roll up your sleeves and "do it yourself"!    </p>    <p>      Two and a half years ago our family of four was living the      All-American Dream. My husband had a good job as an      insulation installer and I stayed home in a fouryear-old      "rancher" and raised our two sons (then 9 and 7). The house      was cute, it had white siding just like it was supposed to,      it was located in a nice middleclass and middle-income      suburb of Vicksburg, Michigan . . . and we were beginning      to grow quite dissatisfied with everything about the way we      were living.    </p>    <p>      Despite the heavy efforts we had made at decorating our      rancher, the placelike so many other suburban "cookie      cutter" houses these days-lacked any kind of personality or      integrity. And the flat land surrounding the home was      attracting more of its kind at an alarming rate. And the      development was growing more and more desolate with each      addition. And the increased automobile traffic that all      those new houses brought in was rapidly making all the new      asphalt and concrete streets around us too dangerous for      our sons to ride bikes on.    </p>        <p>      Finally-after four years of watching our AllAmerican Dream      steadily erode into a nightmare-we had had enough. "We      don't ask much," we told each other. "Just a home with some      character . . . in a more isolated spot . . . with real      native trees around it. Shucks. We'll even compromise and      call anything with a trunk three inches in diameter a tree.      But we've gotta get out of here! "    </p>    <p>      After several months of canvassing realtors' listings and      thousands of miles of not-so-patient searching . . . we      found what we were looking for! Fourteen acres. Not heavily      wooded . . . but stimulatingly wild. And those hills! After      four a years in a flat suburb, the hills seemed a      absolutely sensuous! And the neighbors were a real plus      too: Two owned 80 acres each and the third was a monastery.      All of three frowned on "development".    </p>    <p>      As soon as we had our option-to-purchase in hand, we      excitedly began de.signing our new home. "It should be a      rustic cabin!" we said . . . and then-because we had been      brainwashed by Mad ison Avenue for so long-we added:    </p>    <p>      Rustic in appearance, anyway. But of c nurse we'll need a      dishwasher, and air conditioners, and a clothes washer and      dryer, and mixers, and blenders, and ice crushers, and can      openers, and all the other electric appliances that are,      well, essential to the modern way of life."    </p>    <p>      Yes, it's true. Like so many others, we wanted out to the      simple life . . . but we wanted to drag all the blessings      (curses?) of "civilization" right along with us.    </p>    <p>      I'm sorry to have to report that it wasn't any part of our      Better Nature that made us "see the light" and change our      wicked ways. It was plain of money. Quite simply: If we had      had a contractor put up the house that we wanted      (beautifully rustic on the outside but with a starkly      efficient and mechanized interior) . . . we would have had      to mortgage away the better part of the rest of our lives      in order to pay for it.    </p>    <p>      That was a rude shock! We didn't want to give up a large      part of our earnings for the next 25 or 30 years just for      the dubious privilege of "moving up". We had better things      to do with that money. We wanted to travel. We wanted to go      back to college and take some "fun" courses. We wanted to      live . . . not grub along paying off an expensive      contractor-built house loaded with "timesavers". Still . .      . we did want that house. What to do?    </p>    <p>      And then-it was about May 1976-we started to notice a      number of articles here and there that dealt with      "alternative" architecture and energy taken from the sun      and the wind. We bought a book on the subjects . . .      borrowed a few others . . . and covertly read still more in      the local bookstores.    </p>    <p>      "That's it! " we shouted. "We can build the house      ourselves. And if we put it underground so the earth      insulates the building and modulates its heat requirements,      it probably won't take much fuel to keep the place warm . .      . why, we can probably do all our heating and cooking with      wood. And if we put up our own wind-powered generator . . .      why, we can have many of those electrical appliances we      want without ever having to pay a utility bill!" We were      just thrilled to death to make these discoveries.    </p>    <p>      And scared to death every time we thought about actually      putting our new discoveries into practice'. Could we really      build our own house? Should we? And if we did, should we      really build it underground? If that was such a good idea,      why didn't everyone else do it? And what about solar, wind,      and other forms of "alternative" energy? Did they really      work? Could we make them work for us? Boy! When you're      coming from middleclass America . . . that first step into      Middle Earth can be an overwhelmingly big and a frightening      one.    </p>    <p>      So we vacillated for a couple of months. We refused to face      the one subject we most wanted to think about squarely. We      diverted our attention to other things. We even agreed to      take a trip out west with some friends to give us more time      "to think about" what we knew in our secret heart of hearts      we really wanted to do anyway.    </p>    <p>      That trip-or rather the threat of itfinally proved to be      the catalyst that our Big Project needed. Because the night      before we were due to depart-and after the car was all      loaded-we woke up and just knew we were going to stay home      and build a house instead. And that's what we did.    </p>    <p>      What a relief! To tell the truth, we had always wanted to      explore and colonize a strange planet . . . and (      considering our thentenuous relationship with Mother Earth)      that was more or less what we had just decided to do. We      drew up a rough floor plan on July 2, 1876 . . . took out a      building permit . . . andfinally--set ourselves to work.    </p>    <p>      I always tell people that there are two versions of the      house we built: [A] what we intended to do, and [B] what we      actually did. In reality, things weren't quite that cut and      dried. What happened was our thinking and the building      kinda evolved together . . , from a sometimes      rather-impractical concept of how the world operates . . .      to the construction of a very satisfying, low-cost, and      energyefficient dwelling that now snuggles up to its ears      in a hillside overlooking some beautiful fields and      forests.    </p>    <p>      We wanted a fairly large house (2,300 square feet), we      wanted to build it in southwestern Lower Michigan, and we      wanted to heat it with the so-called "alternative sources      of energy". That was a big order right there: Although zero      is more common, temperatures of 20 below are not unusual in      our neck of the woods during the winter. Couple that with      stretches of horrible overcasts that can last two or three      weeks at a time during the worst cold snaps . . . and      you'll quickly realize that we don't get much help from the      sun when we really need it.    </p>    <p>      We knew right from the beginning, then, that we'd have to      rely on wood heat for our winter comfort. But could we warm      our whole 2,300square-foot home with just one stove? We      knew that might be stretching it a bit . . . but-maybeif we      built a two-story house and opened the lower level into the      upper floor (thereby turning the structure into one large      but compact space) and placed our wood-burner in the very      center of the lower level . . . well, maybe.    </p>    <p>      A two-story dwelling it would be, then. And underground ...      so the earth around it would help moderate the building's      temperature both winter and summer. And if we built      underground, concrete was obviously the best material to      use ... except that poured concrete would be too      complicated for Terry, the boys, and me to handle and too      expensive for us to have a contractor put in. And so we      settled for concrete block construction that we could do      ourselves. See! Our thinking and the design of our building      just more or less evolved into their current forms      together.    </p>    <p>      From the beginning of the project, money was always on our      minds (probably because we were never really sure we were      going to have enough to finish everything we had started).      In the first place, we borrowed $10,000 on a personal note      to buy our 14 acres. (My father cosigned, the banker was      brave, and we had to agree to repay the loan as soon as our      other house-the rancher-was sold.) We also had $2,300 in a      savings account when we began the whole undertaking . . .      and that was it, except for what we could squeeze from      Terry's weekly paycheck as we went along.    </p>    <p>      Our first major expense-after the purchase of the land-was      the $400 we shelled out to the operator who dug the 32' X      36' X 17'-deep hole for our house to sit down in. The act      was also our first real introduction to gravity:      Everything, including the excavator's bulldozer-we soon      noticed-eventually winds up at the bottom when you're      building on a slope.    </p>    <p>      I took over after the 'dozer had finished the rough work      and hacked out our building's footings with a pick and      shovel. (Another discovery: Clay can get mighty tough in      the summer sun.) Then, just as soon as I had that job      completed, we had a Redi-Mix truck backed in and the      footings poured.    </p>    <p>      Immediately after that it rained! A real gully washer which      rearranged our dug-out hillside so badly (gravity again,      you know) that we couldn't even see the freshly poured      cement anymore. So we gritted our teeth and cleared away      the mud . . . then spent the next four months laying the      blocks for the first floor walls, putting in the second      floor itself (so we'd have something to set our one section      of scaffolding up on), and laying the blocks for the second      floor walls.    </p>    <p>      I mixed all the block mortar by hand in a trough and Terry      laid up the walls. We used Type M mortar (which is rated      five times stronger than the regular stuff), just to make      sure the finished structures. would be able to hold back      the 17'-high banks of earth behind them. We also ran 3/4"      reinforcing rod down through every second running block in      the walls (then filled in around the rods with mortar), and      made every fourth one a double or "pillar" block (which was      filled solid with Type M mortar too).    </p>    <p>      All this work was complicated by the fact that we were      clocking 25 miles out to our building site and 25 miles      back again on Saturdays and Sundays. Weekdayswhen the boys      and I drove out in the morning or early afternoon in one      car and Terry came down after finishing work in Kalamazoo      (35 miles away in another direction)-were even worse. But      we always returned home-long after dark-brown from the sun      and dirt . . . exhausted . . . and satisfied.    </p>    <p>      Our life was further complicated during this period by the      fact that we had no supply of potable water on our new      property (every drink we took "out on the job" was carried      in, for months, in gallon milk jugs). An investment of $672      for a 142'-deep well eventually cured the problem . . .      sorta. Because, after spending that chunk of cash, we      didn't have anything left over for a water-pumping windmill      (and working a hand pump for that long a "lift" was tuff).      And thenonce we'd tapped our water supply (even if it was      the hard way at first)-we figured we really oughta go ahead      and install a septic system (which, by the time it was      backfilled and its plumbing, etc., was bought and      installed, forced us to borrow another $7,000 on a      three-year payback basis).    </p>    <p>      It was that septic tank loan which just about broke our      little hearts. The last thing we wanted to do at that time      was increase our indebtedness, but we were racing with the      clock: Our $10,000 loan had to be paid off in less than a      year . . . which meant that we had to finish off our new      home well enough to move into it so we could sell the      rancher and take the money from that deal to pay off the      $10,000 loan. If we had tackled our project on a somewhat      smaller scale, of course, we wouldn't have found ourselves      in that kind of bind. But we were already committed.    </p>    <p>      And that's just when Mother Nature let us know that she had      no intention of holding her winter snow back on our      account. Unfortunately, the walls of our new house were a      trifle short of being completed at the time and there was      absolutely no roof on the building at all.    </p>    <p>      So we spent more money for professional bricklayers to      finish off the last few courses of the main structure and      put up a round tower that will eventually become Terry's      astronomical observatory. A 1,200-gallon, sealed cistern      (that our water pumper fills on days when the wind blows so      we'll have something to drink on the days it doesn't) was      then set into place just outside the west wall of the house      and backfilled.    </p>    <p>      Which finally made it possible for Terry and another fellow      (a cement finisher by trade) to "build" our roof by pouring      three inches of concrete over a layer of galvanized steel      decking that was spread across laminated beams made of four      thicknesses of 2" X 8" yellow pine spiked together (the      laminated beams are actually stronger than solid 8 X 8's).      We then sealed the cement with tar and began working on the      inside of our new-but still far from completedhouse that      winter.    </p>    <p>      First we filled in between joists with fiberglass      insulation ( laying in wiring as we proceeded) and nailed      up our 1" X 6" fir ceiling. Then Terry and his helper      poured the 4"-thick downstairs concrete floor (which made      it possible for us to build a terrifically comfortable      stairway of 2 X 12's to replace the ladder we had been      using to get up and down). And in went the Thermopane      windows (four big ones on the south side of the house and      one tiny one-just big enough to be used as a fire escape-in      each of the boys' a bedrooms on the east). We roughed in      plumbing and raised interior walls. We started kitchen      cabinets of green oak and immediately tore them out and      rebuilt with particle board and ceramic tile ( lopsided      shelves, we found, don't quite do the trick). We installed      a wood-burning stove (an Estate Heatrola) which really      chewed up the wood, but had hardly any effect on our new      dwelling's temperature at all. ( Whether this was due to      the heater, us, or a certain amount of "curing" that our      house had to go through is a moot point. We'd had no other      experience with wood heat at the time.) It was a great day      when we moved the $50 "bargain" Heatrola out and put a $500      Grandpa Fisher in its place. ( We had heat for a      change-once we came home after 18 hours away and found      glowing logs waiting in the stove to greet us! -and we      could cook for the first time in our new home.)    </p>    <p>      At long last winter gave way to spring . . . and the solid      ground in our drive and yards turned into a virtual sea of      mud. So every day we hauled another load of I6'- . long 2 X      4's out to our property on the car roof . . . parked the      vehicle along the road . . . and then gaily slogged up a      footpath-2 X 4's on shoulders-to frame in another closet.    </p>    <p>      It's funny how bored we didn't get asday by day-we made our      house grow from a bare shell into . . . a bare shell with      more parts. ( Why is it that all the really hard work which      goes into a dwell- ing is hidden away from you until after      you have the floors, walls, and roof in and think you're      almost done?)    </p>    <p>      By then, scrounging had become a way of life for us. So we      pounced on the bargain, during Mud Season, when we were      offered 80 panes of double-thick 4' X 6' sheets of tempered      glass (enough to    </p>    <p>      cover the Trombe wall we had planned for the south side of      the house) for only five bucks each (they were seconds from      a patio door company). The bargain buy was delivered well      after dark on a very slippery and very windy night. What      fun! . . . and the breakage wasn't too bad, considering.      But the experience changed our plans for us (the thought of      lifting 60pound sheets of glass 17 feet in the air gave us      the shakes). Instead of a Trombe wall, we now have a      300-square-foot solar greenhouse (which also serves as a      wood drying room and vestibule) built onto the south side      of our home.    </p>    <p>      Throughout all this work we had used hand tools as much as      possible. For speed's sake, though, we also borrowed a      gasoline-powered generator from time to time so that we      could run an electric drill, a saw, etc.    </p>    <p>      It was a Red Letter Day for us, then, when we learned we      could buy a reconditioned Jacobs windplant (the best      windpowered electrical generator ever built) plus batteries      for only $2,325 from North Wind Power Company, P.O. Box      315, Warren, Vermont 05674. It wasn't long after that that      we were hoisting our very own "Jake" to the top of its      75-foot tower and watching it begin to charge its bank of      batteries with "juice".    </p>    <p>      Hey! We needed to finish off the wiring in the house so we      could use that electricity! And an exhaustive check of the      local building code with the township inspector turned up      an interesting fact: There was no building code for 32-volt      direct current wiring. This gave the family      electrician-me-a big shot of confidence. I might blow up      the house, the generator, or myself ... but I couldn't be      sent to jail for it. Well, my wiring job does look a little      ragged in places . . . but it works and it's never given us      any trouble.    </p>    <p>      Somewhere along the way that spring we also bought a used      pickup . . . which was a real life and car saver.      Unfortunately Terry had to sell the remainder (most had      already gone for 2 X 4's and nails) of his ham radio gear      to pay for the vehicle (and just after we had the      electricity in too).    </p>    <p>      By May of 1977 we had finished the plumbing on our new      house (Toilet Day ranked another big "celebration" red mark      on our calendar) . . . thus finally ending one water      problem (the lack of it). To keep the ledger balanced,      however, we immediately discovered another inconvenience      that had to do with water: The roof started leaking like a      sieve.    </p>    <p>      What happened was we had originally intended to completely      cover our house's roof and north, west, and east (except      for the two "fire escape windows" in our boys' bedrooms)      sides with earth. That's why we built the place of concrete      and concrete blocks in the first place (to carry the load      of dirt). But we ran out of earth-and money with which to      move samebefore we were able to realize our grand concept.    </p>    <p>      Well, as I've said before, there are two versions of our      house: [A] what we intended to do, and [B] what we actually      did. In this case, what we actually did was [1] put a      double-sloped metal roof on the building, [2] move into the      house in June of 1977, and [3] start adding 3-1/2" of      fiberglass insulation and T-111 woodpanel siding to all the      exterior walls that never quite got covered with earth.    </p>    <p>      As things currently stand, then, somewhat over half      (instead of all but the south side, as we originally      planned) of our new home's exterior is in direct contact      with the earth. The exposed portion of the walls-as I've      just notedis insulated with 3-1/2" of fiberglass and      covered with siding. And the buried sections are insulated      all around for the first two feet down from grade level      with one inch of styrofoam. We applied no insulation at all      to the outside of the exterior concrete walls from two feet      below the surface on down . . . so that the earth itself      could moderate the building's temperature both winter and      summer.    </p>    <p>      Once all the insulation and siding were in place, we began      to concentrate more and more on the "details" that have      added so much to our standard of living. We winterized our      water system, for instance. And converted an old 110volt AC      refrigerator to run on 32-volt DC so the electricity from      our Jacobs windplant could keep us supplied with ice cubes,      cold storage, etc. What luxury!    </p>    <p>      Another luxury that we soon added was hot water . . . when      my dad welded up a 9" X 18" heat-exchanger box from 3/16"      plate steel and we bolted it to the back of the Fisher.      (This, plus the Kalamazoo cookstove we had already added to      the kitchen-where it sits backed up to the same      heat-storing block wall that the Fisher stove backs up to      in the living roompretty well finished off our heating,      cooking, and water heating system.)    </p>    <p>      We've also pretty well finished off all our home's interior      walls with BondBloc ... a concrete-plaster-like compound      which contains a large number of fine fiberglass fibers.      When a coat of this material is troweled onto both sides of      a stacked block wall (with no mortar put in between the      blocks at all), it produces [A] a handsome, waterproof,      attractive surface and [B] a wall that is three times as      strong as one built with conventional mortar joints. (That      still doesn't beat blocks laid up with Type M mortar,      though, you'll notice.)    </p>    <p>      In short-although we do have a thousand things we still      want to do to our new place-the hardest work is now      completed. We take more time off these days to just relax      and enjoy living on our 14 acres. And-as so many others      who've made the switch from the urban and suburban      middle-class to the Middle Earth way of life have done-we      find we use our time and space a little differently now      than we did back in Vicksburg. We're currently more in tune      with the earth's cycles . . . and we love it.    </p>    <p>      On hot summer afternoons we retreat to our cool (naturally      earth-tempered) living room. In the fall, a revitalizing      brisk walk into the nearby woods yields heaping buckets of      walnuts and hickory nuts . . . that the family later cracks      while gathered around a cheerfully blazing winter fire in      the Fisher. And now that the grass has grown in and we've      done some work on the drive, spring is no longer Mud Season      . . . but a delightful time to "get back outside again" and      enjoy our 14 acres.    </p>    <p>      Sure, we still have plenty of work ahead of us. There are      carpets to put down in the bedrooms, storage space to      finish out, green oak walls to stain, light fixtures to      install, a woodshed and a carport to build. And we still      intend to add 400 to 600 square feet of glasstopped solar      panels to the hillside in front of the house . . . to feed      more heat into the greenhouse (and then on into the main      house itself) during the winter.    </p>    <p>      But we already have electricity, heat, hot water,      refrigeration, and all the other comforts of home . . . and      it doesn't cost us a cent (except for the telephone) in      utility bills! That's real freedom . . . the kind that far      too few people even dream of enjoying these days.    </p>    <p>      And, really, it didn't cost us an arm and a leg to start      living the gentler, more satisfying way of life we now      live, either. We figure that our land, the 2,304-squarefoot      house, windplant, water-pumping windmill, etc., so far has      cost us a grand total of just $23,983 ($11, 658 for the      house alone). And we'll probably spend at least another      $600 finishing off the new home and, maybe, $2,000 to      $3,000 landscaping the property. Which isn't too bad,      especially since we've "paid as we've gone" for the most      part and we don't have any 25- or 30-year mortgages staring      us in the face.    </p>    <p>      Sure, we've worked hard to build our place. But that just      made us healthier and stronger. And now that we're snuggled      into Earthwon (we feel that our new home really is "one      with the earth" and that "the earth has won us over") . . .      we're already thinking about what Earthtu might be like!    </p>    <p>      <em>EDITOR'S NOTE: Last December, MOTHER staffer Travis Brock      visited the home described in this article and has been in      touch with the family since.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Although Travis (who has inspected a number of underground      and semiunderground dwellings and talked to their designers      and builders during the past year or so) feels that the      Beadles family would have an even more efficiently heated      and cooled home if they had gone ahead and .Put the whole      thing underground as they originally planned . . . he      agrees that they aren't doing badly as things now stand.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Terry, Joyce, and the boys-for instance-got through last      winter comfortably while burning only about three cords of      wood. This is very good considering that (A J their new      home wasn't even completely finished off at the time,      JB/the same sized "conventional" house probably would have      consumed eight to 10 cords, and [C] other comparably sized      completely underground houses that Travis has visited have      burned comparable amounts of wood through roughly similar      winters.</em>    </p>    <hr />
