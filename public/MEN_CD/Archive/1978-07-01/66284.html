                		 <hr />		     <p>      One of the most persistent dreams of the great majority of      would-be self-employed entrepreneurs is "have a nice little      mail-order business that I can run all by myself entirely      from the kitchen table".    </p>    <p>      There's also no doubt, though, that there's an awful lot of      downright false and untruthful information being circulated      about the mail-order business (especially the "kitchen      table" variety) today . . . usually spread by rather shady      people who have something to sell to the folks they lure      into believing in The Dream.    </p>    <p>      Which is one of the main reasons why MOTHER is pleased to      present the following "unvarnished truth" about the      small-scale mail-order game as explained by home-business      authority Lillian Borgeson.    </p>    <p>      Well, MOTHER (which has always been almost entirely a      mail-order business) was started eight and a half years ago      on a kitchen table (even though she outgrew that original      kitchen within weeks of her launching) and she's getting      stronger every year. So there's no question such an      operation can grow and prosper.    </p>    <p>      "Make a million in mail order," says the ad. "Easy ... fast      ... start on a shoestring, work at home in your spare time      . . . GET RICH QUICK!"    </p>    <p>      "Wow," you say. "That sounds too good to be true." And      you're right.    </p>    <p>      It is a fact that you can start a mailorder business      working part time at home. Furthermore, home can be      anywhere with mail service, including a sun-powered      homestead in Far Boondocks, New Mexico. But it's also a      fact that hardly anyone makes a million in mail order, and      nobody does it overnight.    </p>        <p>      The process of building a mail-order business is slow,      demanding, and relatively risky, especially at first. In      fact, the failure rate for beginners is probably higher      than in any other type of home business. One reason, no      doubt, is that the misinformation rate for beginners is      equally high . . . especially for those who read and      believe the get-rich-quick come-ons. So here, for a change,      are some unvarnished truths. Listed below are the ten      questions most often asked by mail-order beginners. The      answers will let you know what it really takes to get      started in the business with some reasonable hope of      success. They should also help you to predict whether you      can or can't make it in mail order.    </p>    <h3>      [1] DOES IT TAKE ANY SPECIAL TRAINING TO BE      SUCCESSFUL IN MAIL ORDER?    </h3>    <p>      Not necessarily, but it does take certain aptitudes. In      mail order you sell through advertising alone, to customers      you never see. So any background in advertising is helpful,      and a knack for writing clear, punchy phrases is essential.    </p>    <p>      What few beginners realize, though, is that mail order also      demands methodical organization and a good head for grubby      detail. Excellent recordkeeping is a must. You have to pay      painstaking attention to nickel-and-dime differences in      costs and returns, and you can expect to spend a lot of      time sweating over a hot calculator.    </p>    <p>      Here's a typical example. Let's say you're making and      selling an item you call "Sproutrak", a simple device for      growing alfalfa sprouts on any kitchen counter. Each one      you make costs you $1.73 in time and materials, and each      mail order you get costs you $1.29 to process and ship.      You're selling the "Sproutrak" for $8.95 postpaid, and in      the October issue of <em>Gourmet Gazette</em> you ran a small ad      that cost you $300 and drew 89 responses. Meanwhile, an      identical ad in Dieter's Digest cost $494 but pulled 115      orders.    </p>    <p>      Okay: Which publication is paying off best for you? And are      you making money with both, either, or neither of the      magazines? Or were you actually coming out better with the      deal in your September Gourmet ad, in which you offered two      "Sproutraks" for $15.95 and pulled 57 orders, but had to      spend an additional 71  cents on each one for packing and      ship. ping? And so on.    </p>    <p>      That kind of figuring is actually the heart of the      business. If number juggling drives you up the wall, you'll      be miserable in mail order.    </p>    <h3>      [2] DO I NEED A PERMIT FROM THE POSTAL SERVICE IN      ORDER TO SELL THROUGH THE MAIL?    </h3>    <p>      No. You need no federal license at all, and federal      regulations for mail-order sellers are remarkably simple.      As long as your ads are truthful-and as long as you      fill orders promptly-you should have no trouble      meeting them.    </p>    <p>      In some areas, though, mail-order firms do have to get a      standard city or county business license, so you'll want to      check local requirements at city hall or the county      courthouse. You may also need a state issued "resale      permit", so check with state authorities, too.    </p>    <h3>      [3] WHAT DO I NEED IN THE WAY OF SPACE AND      EQUIPMENT?    </h3>    <p>      Not a lot, but the legendary "kitchen table"-the one      that stars in the rags-to-riches mail-order      tales-usually isn't enough. You need space to work      and space for storing or making the merchandise. You need a      typewriter, letterhead stationery, and files (or boxes or      shelves). You need a work surface for wrapping and labeling      packages, and wheels forgetting them to the post office.      And you should have fairly easy access to a duplicating      machine, a lowcost local printer, and a supplier of      shipping containers (you'll find the latter listed under      Boxes in your local Yellow Pages). And, of course, you need      a product with solid potential for profit.    </p>        <h3>      [4] HOW CAN I RECOGNIZE A GOOD MAIL-ORDER      PRODUCT?    </h3>    <p>      First and absolutely foremost, the price must be right.      Namely, very low. Specifically, your cost for the product      has to be low enough to allow for a very high markup in the      price you'll charge your customers. This is absolutely      essential.    </p>    <p>      The reason is that in mail order, the selling cost for each      item sold-that is, the cost of getting and filling each      order-is very high ... much higher than it is in      other forms of selling. Most retail stores, for example,      can operate profitably on a 40- to 60-percent markup (if an      item costs them $1.00 wholesale, they can afford to sell it      for about $1.40 to $1.60). Not so in mail order, where      advertising cost alone can easily run $3.00 or $4.00 for      each sale you make . . . as, you may have noticed, it did      in those "Sproutrak" examples.    </p>    <p>      Today, with the costs of both advertising and mailing      already high and rising, most professionals say you need at      least a fourto-one markup in order to come out ahead in      mail order. In other words, you have to charge your      customers at least four times as much as the product costs      you, and still come out with a price tag that won't scare      them away.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, it's very tough for a be ginning mail-order      firm to buy goods from wholesalers or manufacturers at      prices low enough to allow for that kind of markup. Which      is why, in many cases, the best product to start with is      something you can produce yourself at low cost. For      example:    </p>    <p>      *Something you grow ... such as herbs, seeds, or      earthworms.    </p>    <p>      *Something you make ... perhaps an unusual craft item.    </p>    <p>      *Something you write and have printed maybe a newsletter,      recipes or formulas, plans or patterns, or some kind of      hew-to-do-it guide or manual.    </p>    <p>      *Something you can buy cheap in bulk and "individualize" by      using low-cost equipment and your own creative ideas . . .      such as bumper stickers or T-shirts.    </p>    <p>      Check the mail-order ads in any national magazine's      classifieds (a favorite advertising medium for small firms)      and you'll find that many or most of the products are in      one of those categories. Check through back issues and      you'll also find that in many cases the same firms run the      same ads year after year ... a sure indication that they're      paying off.    </p>    <p>      In addition to meeting the price requirements, a good      mail-order product should also be easy and inexpensive to      package and mail (which means not perishable or easily      breakable) and unusual enough that the average customer      can't find it down at the local supermarket or department      store.    </p>    <p>      But just meeting those specifications doesn't guarantee      that your product will be a winner or even a comfortable      moneymaker. Sales appeal is something that nobody can      recognize in advance, not even the top professionals. One      of the most successful mail-order men in the      country-Joe Cossman-made a fortune selling two      of the unlikeliest products in merchandising history: "ant      farms" and shrunken heads. Who'd want them? Just about      everybody, it turned out. Then he almost lost that same      fortune by trying to sell low-cost, high-quality fine art      reproductions ... a "sure thing" that hardly anyone wanted      at all.    </p>    <p>      In mail order there's only one way to find out whether your      product idea is a winner or a dud. You simply have to test      it with advertising.    </p>    <h3>      [5] WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ADVERTISE A MAIL-ORDER      PRODUCT?    </h3>    <p>      Basically there are two standard ways to go. One is with      ads in magazines or (less common) in newspapers. The other      is with catalogs, flyers, or brochures mailed directly to      names you get from mailing lists.    </p>    <p>      There are a few cases where it makes sense for beginners to      start out with direct mail . . . when, for example, the      best prospects for your product are a small,      easy-to-identify group of individuals or business firms      that are easy to cover with a short, specialized mailing      list and a light load of inexpensive mailing pieces.    </p>    <p>      In most situations, though, direct mail just isn't      practical until you can spread that high cost-per-person      over a large number of products . . . when you're offering      a whole product line, in other words, rather than just one      or two items. Although many successful mail-order firms do      eventually sell through a combination of magazine      advertising and mailing lists, the ads should almost always      come first.    </p>    <h3>      [6] WHAT'S THE BEST PUBLICATION FOR MY AD?    </h3>    <p>      That depends on what you're selling. What you want is a      publication with presold, "selected" readership (readers      whose interests or background will make them      better-than-average prospects for your product).    </p>    <p>      So for starters, decide what kinds of people-cooks or      car buffs, hobbyists or homesteaders-might have a      special interest in the item you want to sell. And, for      almost any special-interest group you can think of, there's      probably at least one special-interest publication . . .      and more likely several. If you don't know what they are,      go to the reference section of any big public library and      start looking through the various directories of      publications. Ul rich's International Periodicals Directory      and Magazines for Libraries list thousands of publications,      organized by subject. Standard Rate and Data lists the      publications and their current ad rates. Business      Publication Rates and Data does the same for business      publications.    </p>    <p>      When you've narrowed the field to several possibilities,      write to the publishers and ask for sample copies, plus      their information cards for advertisers. Read the      publications carefully, looking for clues to the makeup of      their readership, and pay special attention to the ads.      Publications known to make money for mail-order advertisers      generally carry a noticeably large number of mail-order      ads. If a magazine has classifieds or a special section of      small mail-order ads, so much the better.    </p>    <p>      Be sure each advertisement you run is coded or "keyed", so      when orders start coming in you can tell which publication      and which issue is producing the most business. The easiest      way to do this is to make the key a part of your mailing      address. In the February issue of Gourmet Gazette, for      instance, the address in your ad could read "20 Cherry      Ridge Road, Dept. G-2, Anyplace, U.S.A". In June's Dieter's      Digest, the key would be "Dept. D-6".    </p>        <h3>      [7] HOW CAN I FIND THE BEST MAILING LISTS?    </h3>    <p>      The best mailing list you can get is the names and      addresses of your own satisfied customers. Building this      list is, in fact, one prime purpose of your magazine ads .      . . because generally the biggest payoff in mail order      comes as you expand your product line and, using direct      mail, hit your satisfied customers again and again for      repeat business. Even if the original ads themselves just      break even, the listbuilding process can make the whole      thing worthwhile in the long run.    </p>    <p>      You can also "beef up" your own list by renting lists from      professional brokers. Here, as with magazine ads, the aim      is to get a "selected" audience: not just names and      addresses, but names and addresses of people whose      occupation, hobby, or special interest is tied in with your      products. That's crucial, because a mailing to names on an      unselected list-something as broad, say, as      "residents of New Jersey"-is likely to produce      response of no more than one or two percent, maybe less      (far less). That is, you'll get orders from just one or two      percent of the people you mail to, which may not be enough      to cover the cost of the mailing. On the other hand,      response from a selected list (including your own customer      list) can run as high as f ive or even ten percent.    </p>    <p>      Many big mailing list brokers offer selected lists in      hundreds of different categories-everything from "art      show attendees" to "tractor owners", from "sculptors" to      "skeet shooters", from "abattoirs and slaughterhouses" to      "zwieback manufacturers"-at prices ranging from about      $30 to $45 per thousand names. Some will also send catalogs      of their lists free on request. [An extensive listing of      mailing list brokers and compilers can be found in Direct      Mail List Rates and Data, published twice a year by      Standard Rate and Data Service, Inc., 5201 Old Orchard Rd.,      Sko kie, Illinois 60077. The $65 directory should be      available in most larger libraries.-The Editors.]    </p>    <h3>      [8] HOW MUCH MONEY DO I NEED TO GET      STARTED?    </h3>        <p>      According to a study made several years ago by the U.S.      Small Business Administration, a few successful mail-order      operations have been launched with $100 or less, but most      begin with more than $1,000. On the other hand, other      beginners have bombed despite an original investment of      $50,000 or more.    </p>    <p>      In general, you need enough money to cover the initial      promotion and to keep the business going for six months to      a year. And this should be "risk" money ... money you can      afford to lose.    </p>    <h3>      [9] HOW MUCH MONEY CAN I REASONABLY EXPECT TO      MAKE?    </h3>    <p>      When you start small, just about everything that comes in      for a while has to go back into the business. After that,      you can expect to start earning the net profit typical for      mail-order firms: about eight to ten percent on gross      sales. But every now and then an unusually appealing item      will produce a profit of as much as 50 percent . . . and      that's the carrot that keeps a lot of mail-order people      running.    </p>    <h3>      [10] SOMETIMES I SEE ADS FOR MAIL-ORDER      "FRANCHISES", ADS THAT PROMISE BIG MONEY JUST FOR MAILING      OUT THE COMPANY'S CATALOGS. ISN'T THIS AN EASIER WAY TO GET      INTO MAIL ORDER?    </h3>    <p>      Maybe, but nobody ever put "easier" into the bank. In a      typical deal of this kind, you're a distributor for a      company's products. The company chooses, stocks, and ships      the products to the customers. You buy and mail the      catalogs, pass any orders you get on to the company, and      earn what is-in effect-a salesman's commission      on those orders.    </p>    <p>      In the meantime, though, you've paid for the catalogs, the      mailing lists, and the mailing itself . . . in short, for      the total cost of the direct mail promotion, which is      generally the biggest single expense in mail-order sales.      This is clearly a good deal for the party that's selling      the catalogs. For the party that's buying them, it's      usually not so hot.    </p>    <p>      The fact is that there is no easy way to make money in mail      order. The business isn't romantic or glamorous, and it's      no way to get rich overnight. It's just a business. But if      you're willing to go at it the long, slow, natural way . .      . it can be a very rewarding one.    </p>    <hr />
