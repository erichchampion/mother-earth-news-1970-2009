                <p><strong>      SEASONS</strong>    </p>        <h3>      Venus rising, horseshoe crabs, and other indications of      spring.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Fred Schaaf    </h5>		     <p>      With all the rapid changes in nature throughout springtime,      I wonder if four seasons are enough. After all, seasons are      time periods characterized by a set of events or states in      nature that are distinctly different from those of the      previous time period. Considering the many changes between      March and April alone, shouldn't we add in an extra season      during this time? It might be nice to have something like      the six seasons of the Elves, which appear in stories      written by fantasy writer J.R.R. Tolkien. Between winter      and spring comes "stirring"; between autumn and winter      comes "fading." After all, in much of the United States,      March (and at least some of April) are still extremely      cold, the trees are not fully leaved, and the time of      maximum blooming is still to come-conditions we      hardly associate with spring.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, we must be careful not to distort      reality by forcing it into too many organizational schemes.      Many events in the natural world are not sudden. Like the      cold spells which persist in March and April, these events      just grow fewer and less severe. There's also a positive      side to having four seasons; it makes the details of each      particular one more extreme. So as the cycle of seasons      rolls around again, the nature watcher can search for the      familiar details-patterns in nature and      life-and then delight in the recognition of seeing      them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Bringing May Flowers</strong>    </p>    <p>      Over 600 years ago, Chaucer opened his <em>Canterbury      Tales</em> "Whan that Aprille with his shoures sote      [sweet]/The droghte [drought] of Marche hath perced      [pierced] to the rote [root]..." Everyone knows about the      infamous April Showers, but does the saying actually hold      up to meteorological scrutiny?    </p>    <p>      Yes. Of course the <em>amount</em> of rain you see depends      on what part of the country you live in, and showers seem      to be a phenomenon mainly of Eastern states. Keep in mind      that I'm not talking about the amount of      precipitation-March would probably win hands      down-but the frequency of come-and-go sprinkles and      downpours. Through winter and March, low-pressure systems      tend to produce widespread, not localized areas of      precipitation. But in April, the higher sun of longer days      starts heating the ground significantly, causing warm air      near the surface to expand and rise up into still-cold air      aloft: this "convection" makes cumulus clouds puff up and      grow enough to produce showers and thundershowers. As the      year progresses, convective activity by no means stops, but      a variety of factors usually prevents it from giving rise      to showers on as many days as in April.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The living World</strong>    </p>    <p>      In addition to blooming flowers, May brings us the Season      of the Horseshoe Crab, when the crabs make their big coming      out. This "living fossil," which looks just like a walking      helmet, has virtually no living relatives in the animal      kingdom. From Maine to Mexico, you can see them traveling      the Atlantic beaches. (The only other place the horseshoe      crab exists in the entire world is Southeast Asia.) Perhaps      it's strangest characteristic-aside from its blood,      which is a rich copper blue-is its extra set of eyes,      which can see in ultraviolet light. As for its most useful      characteristic, it would have to be the strange chemical,      limulus lysate, which is found in the horseshoe crab's      blood. This life-saving chemical is used to test whether or      not medicines have become contaminated with bacterial      toxins.    </p>    <p>      This strange animal also provides an essential feast to      several species of migrating birds in May. The primary      location of this event is in New Jersey and the Delaware      shores of Delaware Bay for a brief period in late May.      Horseshoe crabs are then seen in enormous numbers on the      beaches, because this is when the females males lay eggs      for the males to fertilize. Enter hundreds of thousands of      birds, most in the midst of immensely long migrations, all      looking for horseshoe crab eggs and overturned horseshoe      crabs. One type of sanderling (a small type of shore bird),      called the Red Knot, travels 9,000 miles, from as far south      as Tierra Del Fuego in Argentina on its way up to northern      Canada.    </p>    <p>      Scientists believe that a significant part of the world's      total population of bird species may show up in this one      place for overturned horseshoe crabs. If for some reason,      the horseshoe crab did not keep his appointment one year,      most of these birds would perish, and entire species could      actually be threatened. Only recently has the magnitude of      this migration feast and its significance been recognized.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Diagrams for dusk and dawn show scenes about 45      minutes after sunset or before sunrise, as viewed from      40Â° north latitude (approximately correct for the      United States or southern Canada). "Age" of the moon is      amount of time since New Moon.-Adapted from Sky      Calendar, Abrams Planetarium, Michigan State University,      East Lansing, Michigan 48824.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SKY CALENDAR OF SPECIAL EVENTS FOR 1993</strong>    </p>        <p>		<strong>Astronomy</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Morning Venus and Solar Eclipse</em> . On April 1,      Venus rises in the East/Northeast only 35 minutes before      the Sun, but by the 10th it will rise an hour before the      Sun, and by the 30th, over an hour and a half. Always the      brightest point of light in the heavens, Venus gets even      brighter than usual this spring. It reaches "greatest      brilliancy" on May 7, but before then, we might see the      finest astronomical event of the spring: its close      encounter with the Moon on the morning of April 19 (see      "Sky Calendar"). If you can still locate the lunar crescent      towards midday, a small telescope or binoculars may show      the Moon approaching Venus until it moves right in front of      the planet. In Hawaii, the hiding before sunrise is      spectacular.    </p>    <p>      The partial eclipse of the Sun on May 21 is an early      morning event, visible from the northwestern two-thirds of      the United States. On the Pacific Coast, people can see the      Sun rise with a "bite" taken out of it. (Caution: Don't try      to observe this eclipse without the proper filter.)    </p>    <p>      What else is in the heavens this April and May? The finest      constellation sight right now is the Big Dipper, upside      down and at its biggest in the north sky at night.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Special Days</strong>    </p>    <p>      Almost every American knows of Easter, Passover, and      Memorial Day, but there are plenty of springtime holidays      and traditions which have only had prominence across the      Atlantic, and which may seem odd to Americans.    </p>    <p>      Oak Apple Day (Restoration Day), May 29, is a commemoration      of the battle of Wooster in 1651. An oak apple (or oat      gall) is a swelling on a branch caused by larval infection.      The tradition was to carry oak branches with galls in order      to symbolize loyalty to King Charles II (who hid in an oak      tree for 24 hours after being defeated by Cromwell in this      battle. Village children would gather nettles and playfully      whip other children who weren't carrying oak branches.    </p>    <p>      Then there are the days of "The Three Ice Saints of May" on      May 11, 12, and 13. The saints are Mamertus, Pancras, and      Servatius, respectively. Europeans considered these days to      mark the end of the time when killing frosts were likely to      occur. Not many Americans are aware of this tradition, but      it holds true for northern United States too.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Almanac for April and May 1993</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>April</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>May</strong>    </p>    <p>      1 April Fool's Day.
