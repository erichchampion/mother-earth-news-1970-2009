            		<p>    <strong>      NATURAL HEALTH</strong>    </p>		<p>    <strong>      MOTHER'S KITCHEN</strong>    </p>        <h3>      Whole grains are rich in fiber, low in fat and can be      delicious.    </h3>    <h5 id="byline">      By Anne Vassal    </h5>    <p class="credit">      AMY REICHMAN/ENVISION OTHERS:<br />      STEVEN MARK NEEDHAMAN/ENVISION    </p>                <p>      It will come as no surprise to any member of my family that      I'm writing about rice, one of my favorite foods. I was the      "Queen of Rice" growing up, never tiring of ol' "Uncle      Ben." I despised eggs for breakfast, and preferred a bowl      of hot rice and milk topped with butter and cinnamon-sugar.      My mother seldom had the time for special orders, so I      looked forward to overnight visits at my grandparents who      would spoil me with my breakfast treat.    </p>    <p>      While I was obsessing over rice, my baby brother was      "Prince of Pasta," throwing a fit if he missed his daily      fix of noodles or spaghetti. Young children seem to develop      carbohydrate addictions, perhaps because children listen to      their body's needs over its desires. I've never had a      preschooler approach me with, "Boy, I sure could go for a      16-ounce steak!" It'll take a few years of fast food      conditioning before a child's desires turn to beef.    </p>    <p>      Young (and old) bodies need a diet rich in complex,      unrefined carbohydrates. Our American diets have, however,      have given us an overabundance of protein; only      vegetarians, body builders, and pregnant women should be      overly concerned about their protein intake. Instead we      could benefit by consuming more grains such as rice, which      is the staple food of over half of the world's people.    </p>    <p>      Grains were once the dieter's forbidden food. (No starchy      foods allowed!) However, we are now finding that because      whole grains are rich in fiber and low in fat, they are      excellent foods for weight watchers. Carbohydrates burn      more calories than protein because up to one-third of the      carbohydrates aren't digested and are excreted, unabsorbed.      So some of the carbohydrate calories that you eat don't      count. Complex carbohydrates are also high in fiber which      fills you up so you eat less-not to mention the      nutritional benefits of whole grains. Rice bran has been      shown to have a cholesterol-lowering effect similar to oat      bran.    </p>    <p>      With all of the choices of different types of rice, and so      many interesting and flavorful varieties available on the      market, we don't have to get stuck in a rice rut with plain      old white rice anymore.    </p>    <h3>      Types of Rice    </h3>    <p>      BROWN RICE    </p>    <p>      Brown rice is the whole unpolished rice grain with only the      outer hull removed and the rice bran and germ remaining. It      has a slightly nutty flavor and chewier texture than white      rice. It is also the only form of rice containing vitamin E      and substantial dietary fiber. (The quick-cooking variety,      although lower in nutrients, is still superior to white      rice-if saving 20 minutes is important to you.)    </p>    <p>      WHITE RICE    </p>    <p>      <em>Converted</em> : Of all white rices, converted is the      most nutritious one to buy. This is because the process of      steaming converted rice before milling forces about 70      percent of the nutrients back into the grain. There is some      protein loss and almost all of the fiber is lost.    </p>    <p>      <em>Enriched</em> : Some of the nutrients that are lost in      the polishing process are partially replaced in the      "enriched" brands by spraying them on the surface of the      rice. (Don't wash "enriched" rice before cooking it.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Instant</em> : This rice is partially cooked and then      dehydrated, a process by which most of the nutrients are      lost. (Therefore I don't recommend this type unless you are      in a real hurry.)    </p>    <h3>      Popular Varieties of Rice    </h3>    <p>      <em>Long Grain</em><br />      Either white or brown, long grain rice has the largest      kernels. After cooking, the grains remain fluffy and      separate, making it perfect for pilafs, salads, and poultry      stuffing.    </p>    <p>      <em>Medium and Short Grain</em>    </p>    <p>      Brown or white, these shorter grains have a cohesive      quality so they produce a stickier rice.    </p>    <p>      <em>Arborio<br /></em> This is a short grain rice from      Italy used in risotto. When cooked, it produces a creamy      product with an al dente, chewy texture since it has the      ability to consume large amounts of liquid.    </p>    <p>      <em>Basmati</em><br />      White or brown, basmati is an aromatic long grain rice with      a nutty flavor grown in Iran or India.    </p>    <p>      <em>Wehani</em><br />      It is a brown, long grain aromatic rice which can be used      instead of wild rice and is much less expensive.    </p>    <p>      <em>Wild Rice<br /></em> Wild rice is not truly a rice, but      the seed of an aquatic plant usually hand-picked in the      Great Lakes region.    </p>    <p>      Various types and varieties of rice are available by mail      through:    </p>    <p>      Lundberg Family Farms<br />      Box 369<br />      Richvale, CA 95974<br />      916/882-4551<br />      Jambalaya    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>While grains were once the dieter's forbidden      word, they are actually an<br />      excellent food for weight watchers.</em></strong>    </p>    <p>      The Wishbone restaurant in Chicago serves delicious,      southern-style home cooking at affordable prices. One of my      favorites is their Jambalaya. Chef/owner Joel Nickson,      adjusted his recipe for us to prepare at home.    </p>    <p>      <em>1 3 to 4 pound chicken fryer, poached<br />      1 teaspoon olive oil<br />      5 cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 large onion, chopped<br />      ½ cup cajun spice (see below)<br />      ½ teaspoon saffron (1 ounce envelope) or 1 teaspoon      turmeric<br />      3 cups hot chicken broth (saved from the chicken)<br />      l½ cup uncooked white rice (do not use brown      rice)<br />      2 medium red peppers, sliced into ¼-inch      strips<br />      2 medium green peppers, sliced into ¼      inch-strips<br />      ¾ pound. Andouille* sausage or smoked sausage,      sliced into thin circles<br />      Louisiana Hot Sauce (optional)<br /></em> Shrimp      (optional): <em><br />      7 to 8 medium shrimp in the shell<br />      1 tablespoon olive oil<br />      2 cloves garlic, minced<br />      2 teaspoons cajun spice</em>    </p>    <p>      Poach chicken in three cups water in covered pot on low      heat for about one hour. Preheat oven to 350° F. After      saving broth, de-bone and tear into bite-size pieces. Next,      sauté garlic and onion until soft. Stir in cajun      spice and saffron, then add hot broth, rice, peppers,      chicken, and sausage. Transfer ingredients into a deep      oven-proof casserole with a lid. Cover and bake for      approximately 40 minutes, or until rice is thoroughly      cooked. Taste to see if you prefer it any hotter. If taste      is too bland, add a few drops of hot sauce, such as      "Louisiana Hot Sauce."    </p>    <p>      Bulk Cajun spice:    </p>    <p>      <em>1 cup paprika (Hungarian preferred)<br />      ½ cup salt<br />      1/8 cup (3 tablespoons) cayenne pepper<br />      1½ tablespoons white pepper<br />      1/8 cup (3 tablespoons) garlic powder (not garlic      salt)<br />      1/8 teaspoon onion powder<br />      1 tablespoon dried oregano<br />      1 tablespoon dried thyme</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Shrimp preparation: In a skillet, heat oil and      sauté shrimp (in shell), garlic, and cajun spices      until shrimp is done. Serve placed on top of      Jambalaya.</em>    </p>    <p>      *A creole sausage found at butchers or gourmet grocers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Porcini Mushroom Risotto</strong><br />      This entree is at its best when prepared with fresh porcini      or shitake mushrooms. Since these mushrooms are expensive,      I buy a few ounces to add to regular mushrooms. Dried      mushrooms may also be used if fresh porcini or shitake are      unavailable.    </p>    <p>      <em>½ cup pancetta (Italian bacon), diced<br />      2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      5 cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 medium onion, diced<br />      1 pound package arborio rice<br />      1 cup white wine<br />      2 cups chicken broth<br />      1 cup water<br />      ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      ½ pound mushrooms, chopped (porcini, shitake,      button)<br />      ½ cup pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese,      grated<br />      1/2 cup parsley, chopped freshly ground pepper</em>    </p>    <p>      In a small non-stick skillet, fry pancetta until brown; set      aside. In a large soup kettle, sauté garlic and      onion. Add rice and cook on medium heat for a minute or      two, stirring so rice doesn't stick or burn. Never put a      lid on the pan. Add wine and cook for five minutes,      stirring occasionally. When rice becomes dry, add one cup      of chicken broth; cook for 10 minutes, stirring      occasionally. Add other cup of broth and cook for 10 more      minutes. Add water, cayenne, and mushrooms, cooking until      rice begins to stick and isn't soupy. Stir in parsley and      cheese. Add seasonings and ground pepper. Serve topped with      extra parsley and grated cheese. Serves six.    </p>    <h3>      Tomato-Pesto Risotto    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 tablespoons olive oil<br />      4 cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 medium onion, finely chopped<br />      1½ cups arborio rice<br />      1 cup chicken broth<br />      1 can (28 ounces) Italian plum tomatoes, chopped. Save      juice.<br />      ½ cup water<br />      salt (optional)<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      ½ cup freshly grated parmesan or romano cheese<br />      1/3 cup pesto sauce, homemade or bottled</em>    </p>    <p>      In large pot, heat olive oil; add garlic and onions.      Sauté but don't brown. Add rice and stir for one      minute. Add broth and cook on medium heat (uncovered) for      five minutes, stirring occasionally. When rice begins to      stick, add tomatoes and juice. Cook for about 10 minutes      until rice begins to stick again. Add seasonings, cheese,      and pesto. Serve immediately topped with grated cheese.    </p>    <p>      Pesto<br />      <em>3 cloves garlic<br />      2 tablespoons pine nuts or walnuts<br />      2 cups fresh basil leaves (or substitute cilantro or      parsley)<br />      2 tablespoons lemon juice<br />      2 tablespoons olive oil (or more if dry)<br />      dash cayenne and salt<br />      ¼ cup freshly grated parmesan cheese</em>    </p>    <p>      In food processor or by hand, chop garlic and nuts. Add      basil and chop. Add rest of ingredients and blend. Serve      immediately or freeze in plastic wrap-the pesto turns      brown quickly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Broccoli-Cheese Pie</strong><br />      Crust:<br />      <em>2 cups cooked, warm rice<br />      1 tablespoon oil<br />      1 tablespoon butter, melted</em>    </p>    <p>      Filling:<br />      <em>1 teaspoon oil<br />      1 small onion, minced<br />      2 cups broccoli, chopped<br />      2 eggs<br />      ½ cup low-fat milk<br />      ¼ teaspoon cayenne pepper<br />      ¼ teaspoon salt<br />      1/8 teaspoon nutmeg freshly ground pepper<br />      1½ cups low-fat cheddar cheese, grated</em>    </p>    <p>      Preheat oven to 350° F. In a nine-inch pie pan, mix      rice, butter, oil. Pat on bottom and sides. Bake for five      minutes and remove. Sauté onion for about one minute      in a small skillet or in the microwave. Place onion and      broccoli on top of crust. In a blender or food processor,      mix eggs, milk, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. Pour mixture over      broccoli and onions. Sprinkle grated cheese on top. Bake 30      to 35 minutes until a knife placed in the center of pie      comes out clean. (Don't over-bake or broccoli will be      overcooked.)    </p>    <h3>      Southwestern Salad    </h3>    <p>      <em>2 cups long-grain, cooked brown rice (works best cooked      at least one day before and refrigerated)<br />      1 cup corn, fresh or frozen<br />      1 15 ounce can of small red beans (kidney or black beans      can be used instead)<br />      1 green or red pepper, chopped<br />      ½ medium red onion, finely chopped<br />      3-4 green onions, chopped<br />      ½ cup cilantro (or parsley), chopped</em>    </p>    <p>      DRESSING:<br />      <em>1 large clove garlic, minced<br />      1 small hot pepper, minced or ¼ teaspoons cayenne      pepper juice from 1 lime<br />      1 tablespoon oil<br />      1 tablespoon red wine vinegar<br />      ½ teaspoon ground coriander<br />      ½ teaspoon ground cumin<br />      1½ teaspoon chili powder pinch of sugar salt to      serve</em>    </p>    <p>      Stir dressing into salad and chill for an hour or so before      serving.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Creamy Rice Pudding</strong><br />      This is a simple no-bake rice pudding to make with your      children. It's good even for breakfast.    </p>    <p>      <em>2 egg yolks<br />      ¼ cup maple syrup<br />      1 tablespoon brown sugar<br />      1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />      1/8 teaspoon nutmeg<br />      2 cups low-fat milk<br />      3 cups cooked brown rice<br />      1 teaspoon vanilla<br />      ½ cup golden raisins (optional)</em>    </p>    <p>      In a blender put yolks, maple syrup, sugar, cinnamon,      nutmeg, and milk. Blend until foamy. Pour into saucepan and      add rice. Simmer on low heat, stirring occasionally, until      pudding thickens slightly (about 20 minutes). It will      continue to thicken as it chills. Stir in vanilla and      raisins. Serve chilled, sprinkled with cinnamon.    </p>    <p>      <em>Here are a few MOTHER tips for you from Lil Carry that      will add some sass to ordinary white rice. First, wash rice      with cold water twice. Then cover rice with an inch of      water. If you intend to eat the rice with fish or fowl, add      four chicken bouillon cubes before bringing the water to a      boil. If you plan to eat the rice with beef, drop in four      beef bouillon cubes.</em>    </p>
