                <p>      <em>Do you like to make music and create beautiful things?      You can combine both in this craft.</em>    </p>          <h5 id="byline">By Assunta Martin</h5>        <p>      After years of experimenting with crafts as varied as      weaving, kite making, and building electric dulcimers, my      husband, Augie, and I have finally hit on the undertaking      most suited to our temperaments: drum making! Appealing to      both the artist and the musician in us, these simple      instruments offer visual beauty and exciting sound. And      because each creation is unique, we wait eagerly for each      drumhead to dry so we can enjoy the new tone. What's more,      our instruments sell in craft and music shops for $20 to      $50 each, with occasional requests for custom-made models      that bring in as much as $100!    </p>    <p>      But enough of our enthusiasm. Let's get on to <em>your</em>      instruments and see how to make them!    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLLECTING YOUR MATERIALS</strong>    </p>        <p>      To construct a drum, you'll need some sort of a suitable      body (more on that later), a leather punch, scissors or a      cutting knife, and-since no form of tanned leather      will serve your purpose well-a piece of rawhide. We      order 2' X 3', ready-to-use rawhide swatches from our local      hobby shop for $9.00 each. We're also lucky enough to have      access to a couple of free goatskins per week from a farmer      down the road. To remove the hair from these small and      easy-to-handle hides, we soak them in a mixture of one can      of lye to 15 gallons of water. Goatskins, however, are      considerably thicker than purchased rawhide, so we use them      only for larger, deep-toned tom-toms.    </p>    <p>      Of course, for most purists who wish to start from scratch      by using totally untreated skin, a trip to the      slaughterhouse is probably in order. There, fresh hides,      roughly 6' X 8', can usually be bought for about $35. From      personal experience, though, we don't recommend this route.      First of all, the newly stripped skins weigh 75 to 85      pounds each and are slippery, gory, and all but      unmanageable. Furthermore, our nauseating journey through      the "kill room" to the salt pits where the skins were      stacked sent us on a frantic search for vegetarian recipes!      The rawhide then had to soak for three to five days (we      used a 35gallon trash container), after which, our source      claimed, the piece could be scraped free of hair and any      remaining organic matter by "shaving" it with a file. We      soon discovered, however, that we lacked the time, energy,      and dexterity such a process calls for. (Perhaps those more      experienced in this area will have greater success than we      did.)    </p>    <p>      But though <em>that</em> task turned us off, searching out      bodies for our instruments became one of our favorite      pastimes. Nurseries offer a wide variety of ceramic and      pottery containers that can make suitable drum bodies, as      can the casks and wooden planters such outlets generally      stock. Pipes, well casings, fittings, and tubes of nearly      every dimension and material, from clay to plastic, can be      found at local plumbing stores. (We've even made a fine      drum from a $4.00, 1'-long piece of heating-duct pipe.)      Furthermore, potter's seconds, flea markets, and garage      sales should never be overlooked. As a matter of fact,      because a drum can be either single-or double-headed,      almost any hollow form will do. In our initial enthusiasm,      both my sourdough-starter crock and an abandoned birdbath      pedestal were transformed into percussion instruments! In      addition, if you are fortunate enough to own a lathe, you      can turn beautiful wooden bodies. (White cedar, or      arborvitae, was highly favored for drums by the Chippewa      Indians, who patiently whittled and burned out tree      trunks.) Hollow logs that are rot-free and show no signs of      splitting or cracking are also great drum bodies, but they      aren't easy to find.    </p>    <p>      Most of these suggested bases require no work other than      locating them. However, if you plan to use plastic duct      pipe, sand its edges to prevent them from cutting the      stretched skin. You also may want to decorate these rather      plain-looking shells (we use bright acrylic paints); this,      of course, you'll need to do <em>before</em> lacing on the      drumhead.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSTRUCTING THE DRUM</strong>    </p>    <p>      Before you attach the skin to the body you've selected, the      dry rawhide must be soaked for a minimum of four hours in a      large container of cold water. (Hot water will cause the      tissue to break down, which will destroy the drum's fine      tone.) We usually soak our drumskins in the bathtub      overnight. When the hide has absorbed enough water to      become flexible and springy, we squeeze out the excess, as      you'd squeeze a waterlogged sponge, and start lacing.    </p>    <p>      Each culture has developed its own unique style for      attaching drumheads, and the lacing can become a very      decorative feature, depending on one's inventiveness. For      the sake of simplicity, I'll give directions for the two      most common techniques.    </p>    <p>      First, place the rawhide swatch on a table or board and,      using either scissors or a sharp knife, cut 1/4"-wide      straps from around the skin's border to produce lengthy      thongs. It you're making a very large instrument, cut the      laces 1/2" wide or more.    </p>    <p>      Next, cut out a circular drumhead with a diameter 2" larger      than that of the drum you wish to cover. If you're using a      cylindrical form, such as duct pipe, you'll probably want      to double-head it (that is, put a beating surface on each      end). If so, cut out two heads of equal size.    </p>    <p>      Now, using a leather punch, make evenly spaced holes, no      more than 2" apart and 1 from the drumhead's edge, all      around the skin's circumference. Be sure, though, when      using two pieces, that each has an <em>equal</em> number of      holes. Center the drum body on top of one head, then place      the other skin on top of the drum. A clean look is achieved      by locating the upper holes directly over the bottom ones,      but this is largely a matter of taste; if you choose a more      random lacing pattern, it won't affect the ease of the task      or the drum's sound in any way. Run the thong through the      top slit, down through the bottom one, and then bring it up      again diagonally to the next top hole. Continue this      process around the drum, and if the end of your strip runs      short, just attach another rawhide piece with a square      knot, or splice it as shown in the accompanying      illustration.    </p>    <p>      At this point, the thong will not yet be secured. Before      tying it off, gently pull and tighten the head and lacing.      Be careful not to stretch it too much, or the wet rawhide      will tear. Keep working at it, going around the perimeter      several times. Don't overdo this, though, because as the      hide dries, it will tighten considerably. When the head's      surface appears to be smooth and wrinkle-free and the thong      is tight, but not taut, tie the two ends of the lace      together where they meet.    </p>    <p>      Since we have access to a pottery source. most of our drums      are one-sided, and we've found that single-head lacing is a      pleasingly simple operation. Just invert the container over      the prepunched circle of skin, then prepare half as many      thongs as there are holes. We tie the first lace in a hole      with a square knot ...bring it across the bottom of the      base and up to the hole on the opposite side ...and secure      it with another knot. After following this procedure around      the body until all of the "sets" of holes have been laced,      we check for surface smoothness and tighten up any loose      knots.    </p>    <p>      Just recently we've added a new look to single-headed,      earthen pottery drums. We drill evenly spaced holes around      the edge of the pot and tie the drumhead on with separate      thongs. Some instruments laced in this style can be seen in      the accompanying photo.    </p>    <p>      If the container you choose has a lip, no lacing is      required. First, make sure the surface is smooth and tight;      next wrap a band of rawhide 1/2"-1" wide around the      overlapping head and tie it.    </p>    <p>      Whatever the style of drum, you'll have to decide whether      or not to trim off any extra hide that protrudes around the      edges. If you do snip off the surplus, leave at least 1/4"      around the lacing holes.    </p>    <p>      When drums are drying, double-headed versions must be      placed so that the air can circulate over both heads. Keep      in mind, too, that a drum must dry slowly and evenly, as a      too-rapid dehydration would cause the skin to wrinkle,      buckle, or pucker-and might even warp the frame.      Therefore, place your creation in a warm room with a      consistent temperature, but at some distance from any heat      source. And, no matter how great the temptation, don't      touch or thump the skin during the drying process. In 24      hours, your patience will be well rewarded. Your drum will      be ready to be played on as much and as hard as the spirit      moves you!    </p>    <p>      Some final notes: The tighter a head is stretched, the      higher the drum's tone will be, though dampness and cold      weather will tend to deaden the sound. Should the latter      occur, just warm up the instrument near a stove for ten      minutes, and the head and laces will tighten again.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ADDED TOUCHES</strong>    </p>    <p>      You may want to beat your drum by hand or with one or two      sticks, and-as is the case with constructing the      actual instrument-there are many ways to make such      beaters. Moreover, the type of stick will vary the sound      produced. Corks, Superballs, or handstitched suede "gloves"      attached to dowels or chopsticks all work wonderfully and      take only minutes to make.    </p>    <p>      Then too, decorating your instrument may prove to be as      much fun as constructing it. Feathers, bells, beads, and      paint can all be added. Some southwestern Native Americans      even paint the drumheads, but to follow their example, you      must apply the paint after the hide has dried, or the      colors may run. However, in our opinion, a completed drum      in its most simple form looks attractive as is and really      doesn't need too much extra "embroidery" on it.    </p>    <p>      If you're inclined, as we were, to make more than one drum,      you'll soon have a bunch of odd-size rawhide pieces, which      can be turned into rattles. To do so, I use waxed linen      thread to sew simple forms, such as a ball, leaving one end      open. Then with a funnel I pour rice or popcorn into the      soaked and wrung-out shape and let it dry overnight. Next      day, I remove most of the filling ...insert a dowel ...bind      the ball to it with a small strip of wet hide ...and let      the rattle finish drying. These shakers make great      additions to our percussion collection!    </p>    <p>      <strong>IDEAS GALORE</strong>    </p>    <p>      There's really no end to the variety of drums that can be      made. In all cultures the world over, people have been      entranced by rhythm-producing instruments, and they've left      us traditional examples made from wood, horns, shells,      pottery, baskets, gourds, and metal-with our      generation adding plastic to that list. We've found, in      fact, that plasticpipe drums sound as good as any of the      others and are very inexpensive to make.    </p>    <p>      We've discovered, too, that reading about drums has been      almost as fascinating as making our own. (We particularly      liked <em>Musical Instruments of the World: An Illustrated      Encyclopedia</em> from Diagram Group, Paddington Press      Ltd., Two Continents Publishing Group, 1976; $29.95.) And      our enthusiasm for our craft is far from waning. It seems      we come up with a new idea almost every day, and we      sincerely wish you all the excitement we've found in the      course of rediscovering the world's oldest musical      instruments.    </p>
