                <p>      <em>When you start thinking about weatherproofing your      house, look down. You may need to.. .</em>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Bob Johnson    </h5>        <p>      Quite often homeowners are so busy insulating, caulking,      and weatherstripping obvious energy leaks that they fail to      check their homes' foundations for the kind of seepages      that can cause cold floors (and feet), higherthan-need-be      utility bills, frozen water pipes, and drafts up walls and      around heat ducts.    </p>    <p>      After years of being exposed to cold, rain, and snow, the      mortar that holds together the foundations (usually block,      rock, or brick) of older homes tends to develop holes and      cracks. It takes only a few minutes to determine whether      your underpinning needs attention, and-better still-just a      few sparetime hours to make the repairs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT CAN YOU DO?</strong>    </p>    <p>      There are two ways to stop such leakage without having to      resort to building a new foundation, and, surprisingly, the      more expensive method is not in most cases the best.    </p>    <p>      The first process-and the least effective, to <em>my</em>      way of thinking-is to put fiberglass batts or roll      insulation on the <em>inside</em> of the leaking wall. You      see, it's virtually impossible to recover the cost of this      repair in energy savings over a reasonable period of time,      and though this procedure may stop the leaks, it doesn't      stop the deterioration.    </p>    <p>      The alternative is to point or plaster (or both) the      bulwark. These jobs can be accomplished in a few hours-even      by a noviceand the raw materials are <em>not</em> costly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WHAT YOU'LL NEED</strong>    </p>    <p>      The supplies necessary for pointing and plastering include      masonry-grade cement, sand, and water. <em>(EDITOR'S NOTE:      The author recommends masonry-grade cement because it is      finely ground and thus quite adhesive, and also because it      contains additives that control the setting time and add      waterproofing.]</em> Each project will require a different      amount of grout, but a 94-pound sack of cement (about      $4.50) and 2 cubic feet of sand (around $16.00 a cubic      yard) should carry you through a weekend of plugging the      gaps ...and even leave you with filler for the children's      sandbox!    </p>    <p>      If you don't have a mortar box or cement mixer on hand, an      old galvanized foot tub or a five-gallon plastic bucket-the      kind industrial supplies come in-will work fine. Just be      sure to clean all utensils as soon as you're finished for      the day. You'll also need a small pointing trowel, a      plastering trowel (if you decide to do both jobs), a wire      brush, a whisk broom, a big, sturdy screwdriver, a putty      knife, and a spray bottle (the kind window cleaner comes      in).    </p>    <p>      Don't, however, rush off to the hardware store and pay a      big price for professionalquality trowels. Such flexible      tools, which will spring back to their original shape, are      certainly the best, but less expensive models will work      just as well for a short time, and the difference in price      is usually $10 or more. Better yet, if you plan ahead by      looking around at garage sales and flea markets, you'll      probably be able to find quality tools at secondhand      prices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GETTING READY</strong>    </p>    <p>      Now that you have your implements assembled and have      arranged to have the cement and sand delivered, it's time      to prepare the foundation.    </p>    <p>      Carefully clean "rotten" mortar out of all cracks that need      repair. Use the heavy-dut% screwdriver and putty knife to      pry out the decayed grout, which will be grainy and      crumbly, and then go over the cracks with the wire brush.      Finally, sweep out any remaining small particles with the      whisk broom and wipe out the dust with an old terry towel.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MIXING THE MUD</strong>    </p>    <p>      The rule of thumb for making grout is two parts sand to one      part cement. This ratio produces concrete that's rich      enough to bond well to the existing foundation material.      Before adding water to the cement and sand, though, make      sure they are <em>thoroughly</em> mixed. Each grain of sand      must be coated with cement if a good cohesion is to be      established. Do the dry-mixing by folding the two      components together until the whole batch <em>is</em>      gray-dark gray if the sand is damp-and make sure there      isn't a hint of yellow sand color <em>anywhere,</em> and      that there's no caking at the bottom of the container.    </p>    <p>      Next, stack the mixture to one side of the vessel and pour      water, a bit at a time, into the hole you've created. Pull      the sand/cement blend into this reservoir, mixing      constantly. Continue until the mortar has the consistency      of extra-stiff cake batter.    </p>    <p>      The proper thickness of the cement will depend somewhat      upon the skills and preferences of the person applying it.      If you'd like a stiffer grout, sprinkle a little cement on      the mixture and blend it in. If, on the other hand. the mud      is too thick to suit you, mix in a few squirts from the      water bottle.    </p>    <p>      When you're satisfied that the mixture is right, it's time      to apply it to the foundation. First, though, spray water      on the area to be worked so that the mortar will adhere to      it (this process is especially critical in warm weather).    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO POINT...</strong>    </p>    <p>      Pointing involves putting grout in the cracks and-as best      you can-making it look like the original mortar. This      technique is most effective in cases where there are just a      few small cracks, or when the foundation is made of fairly      sizable pieces, such as cement blocks or large rocks.    </p>                        <p>      <strong>Materials needed to</strong> <strong>repair cracks      and deteriorated joints in a brick foundation: mixing      container,<br />      masonry-grade cement, spray bottle, whisk broom, pointing      trowel, putty knife, screwdriver, wire<br />      brush, and plastering trowel.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>There are several steps in pointing a brick      foundation: First, remove the old, deteriorated grout      from<br />      between the bricks, using the screwdriver and putty knife.      Next, give the joint a good going-over<br />      with a wire brush. Then sweep it out with a whisk broom and      wipe it clean with a towel. Spray the<br />      to-be-repaired area with the water bottle, apply the new      mortar to the cracks with a pointing trowel,<br />      scrape off the excess, then smooth the grout with the broom      of the travel.</strong>    </p>    <p>      First, pick up a small amount of the mud on the edge of the      trowel and push it into the fracture. If the crack is long      and straight, you can use the trowel to form ridges in the      grout (in the container); then cut off beads with the edge      of the tool and press them into the joint. Once the mortar      is in the crevice, run the point of the trowel down the      middle of it to force it between the blocks. Repeat the      process until the fissure is filled, then scrape off the      excess and smooth it down one last time with the bottom of      the trowel. (Dampening the tool with water from the spray      bottle before the last step will give the job a      slicker-looking finish.)    </p>    <p>      Pointed joints aren't always neat-especially when the work      is done by an amateur-because the new grout is a different      color, and it's difficult to make a filled crack look like      the original. On the other hand, the method is effective.    </p>    <p>      <strong>OR PLASTER</strong>    </p>    <p>      If you can ice a cake or spread peanut butter on a piece of      bread, you can plaster over an old foundation and usually      come out with a professional-looking job. Plastering takes      longer than pointing, and the materials cost more, but the      technique is the best one to use for badly deteriorated      foundations constructed of relatively small components,      such as bricks.    </p>    <p>      The preparations required for plastering are the same as      those for pointing, except that you need to pay a little      more attention to the consistency of the mortar, since      you'll be putting a coat of concrete over the outside of      the foundation. As noted earlier, the only additional tool      you'll need is a plastering trowel, which is a long,      narrow-handled device with square ends.    </p>    <p>      Apply the mortar in globs and then spread it over the      surface with sweeping circular strokes of the trowel, all      the while carrying the leading edge just a fraction of an      inch <em>above</em> the working material so the tool      doesn't gouge it. After applying a few square feet of the      cement, go back over it carefully to put on the finishing      touches. Some folks like a smooth surface-which you can get      with a little practice and patience-while others prefer a      rough, grainy look. It's really just a matter of taste.    </p>    <p>      A quarter of an inch of concrete coating on the foundation      will usually be sufficient, but up to two inches can be      used. (You can also employ a base of chicken wire or wire      mesh to give the plaster increased strength and to prevent      cracks.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>AND REMEMBER ...</strong>    </p>    <p>      Filling holes is only part of the job of weatherizing a      foundation. Insulation should be added to crawl space      covers, and if you have a basement with windows, those      should be given some attention, too. A good way to keep      cold air from getting in around the windows (and the      ventilation blocks) is to cut fiberglass insulation to fit      the opening, back it up with fiberboard, and then drive a      couple of stakes in the ground to hold the "sandwich" in      place.    </p>    <p>      So, grab a trowel, mix some grout, and get down to the      basics of making <em>your</em> home more energy-efficient.    </p>
