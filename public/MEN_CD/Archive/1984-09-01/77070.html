        <p><em>Conventional</em> <em>publishing wisdom claims that it's a mistake to run poetry in a "consumer" magazine. Although that may often be true, we're convinced that MOTHER's readers are the kind of people who look for beauty in the practical and search out practicality in the beautiful ...and who realize that good poetry can be useful as well as inspiring. In fact, the best of poems can help us recognize the wonderful-and often well-hidden-similarities that all humans share ...and, by doing so, can make each of us feel a little bit less alone. The poetry included in this occasional feature-be it brand-new or previously published, written by a recognized poet or a first-timer-will be material that, in the eyes of MOTHER's editors, helps us see ourselves in the words of others. It's that quality, and the fact that the work presented here will reflect the range of subject areas usually presented in this magazine, that gave this feature its name.</em></p><p><strong>Rowing the Boat</strong><br /><br />No matter which oar I pulled or how I churned, battering with the oar's end weed that clung, the skew-keeled boat merely lurched and turned widdershins like a top backwards slung, so backwards was the way we rowed her so we went out and away from what we pointed at till we arrived at the place the boat was bent and dropped our lines and panting sat while wild birds flipped in the air and dove for the same bugs the bass were rising for that we hoped to hook so that we could prove ourselves in the boat equal to birds, bugs or bass in the dark on the water where the air is black as a bat and the white stars stare.</p><p>-David Lunde</p><p>Excerpted from Sludge Gulper 1, by David Lunde Copyright 1971 by David Lunde Published by Basilisk Press and reprinted by permission</p><p><strong>Knob Pines</strong></p><p>Insufficient, like all apologies,<br />they are the arms of the starved<br />dead, stiff extrusions from shallow<br />graves. The loggers clearcut first,<br />then planted these excuses and left.<br /><br />We watch the knob pines wave; even<br />the fog moving inland is enough<br />to make them sway: their defeated<br />roots gnarl around too little clay,<br />and they fall, unhonored, into bone</p><p>yards of themselves, making a low,<br />tangled sky, the last landscape<br />of snakes. Heavy with their resinous<br />cones, the knob pines hold each other<br />and conspire; their only wish is fire.<br /></p><div class="sidebar"><p>If fire were to rise from the crotch<br />of the hill; if fire were to suck life<br />out of air like a slow, red mouth; if<br />fire unsprung these cones into glowing<br />seed, the dead could rise after.<br /><br />We make large, decisive noises<br />against the resurrection of these t trees,<br />and listen, at noon, to their silence.</p><p>-David Swanger</p><p>Reprinted with permission of <em>Poetry</em><em>Northwest</em> <em>(Spring</em> 1984 Vol. XXV.
