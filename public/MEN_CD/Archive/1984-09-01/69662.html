                <p>      <strong><strong>At Gary's suggestion, MOTHER took a look at      what's going on in the bioregional      movement.<br /></strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      This past May, more than 200 people from all over the      United States and Canada, as well as from places as far      away as Germany, Australia, and South Africa, gathered near      Kansas City, Missouri, for the first North American      Bioregional Congress (NABC). The      participants-including MOTHER staffer Emily Stetson      - were a decidedly diverse group of individuals      involved in organic farming, urban reforestation, Green      politics, water conservation, appropriate technology, the      rights of native and tribal peoples, and more. During the      cooperative five-day event this multifaceted body came      together - in the true sense of the verb      <em>congress</em> - <em>to work</em> toward and      celebrate the vision of a sustainable, harmonious North      America.    </p>    <p>      Although folks in various bioregions (the Ozarks, the Great      Lakes, etc. - see the sidebar, "What's Your      Bioregion?" of this issue) have been meeting in separate      congresses for some time, NABC marked the first      <em>continental</em> convening of bioregionalists. The      congress-a result of more than two years of planning-was      coordinated by the Bioregional Project of New Life Farm,      the NABC Coordinating Council, the Ozark Area Community      Congress (OACC), and the Kansas Area Watershed (KAW)      Council.    </p>    <p>      Using the four years' experience of the OACC as a guide,      the participants at the congress formed committees to      address various topics of significance to bioregionalism:      Green politics, permanent agriculture, the bioregional      movement itself, forestry, water, appropriate economics,      communications/media, education, arts and culture,      community empowerment, environmental defense, peace, and      native Indian and land-based peoples. These committees met      several times each day to develop draft statements that      were later presented to the congress as a whole. A myriad      of workshops, panel discussions, slide shows, and      projects-including the handcrafting of a 17-square North      American Bioregional quilt-filled the time not devoted to      daily congress meetings or committee work.    </p>    <p>      The week-long work of the committees culminated in the      final plenary session, when the draft statements and      resolutions of each committee were presented to, discussed      by, and decided upon by consensus of the entire congress.      Taken as a whole, these detailed resolutions form the joint      statement of all those in attendance at NABC.    </p>    <p>      The most powerful result of the congress, however, was      perhaps one that couldn't be recorded as such on paper, but      it was felt by each of us who participated. We came to the      congress as a diverse conglomeration of individuals and      organizations and causes from all parts of the continent .      . . and we left as one body, with our visions and energies      unified. Through our sharing of ideas and learning about      one another's efforts, we became aware of the      interconnectedness of our purposes. Green politics,      antinuclear efforts, and organic methods of agriculture,      for example, all have a place within the larger picture of      the bioregional movement. And with this awareness came the      recognition of our enormous combined potential as one      grassroots effort to make our alternative vision for this      nation, this continent, and this world become a reality.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: You can obtain a copy of the NABC I Congress      Proceedings-which includes committee reports, resolutions      of the congress, and various articles for $10 prepaid from      the Bioregional Project/NABC, New Life Farm, Box 129,      Drury, MO 65638.
