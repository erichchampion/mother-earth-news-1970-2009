                <p>      "I've decided to devote my life to cultivating my natural      beauty!" (Lucy, in Clark Gesner's You're A Good Man,      Charlie Brown)    </p>    <h5 id="byline">By Lin Grensing</h5>    <p>      Now, I realize that some folks scoff at beauty aids and      cosmetics. That's just because they don't know how      rejuvenating playing with cosmetics can be. Taking a few      minutes a day-or a couple of hours one afternoon a week-to      attend to one's "natural beauty" can be very relaxing.      Besides, it's <em>fun!</em> And this luxury doesn't have to      be expensive or hazardous to your health ...not if you make      your own beauty aids out of all-natural ingredients found      in your kitchen or garden. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE In issue 87,      the mini-manual, "MOTHER's Guide to Hazardous Household      Substances,"pointed out some of the dangers of using      commercial cosmetics.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Of course, there are about as many different concoctions to      be made from such raw materials as there are ingredients to      make them from. But for starters, let me guide you through      a day's worth of some of my favorite easy-to-create home      beauty recipes.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>MORNING ABLUTIONS</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Waking up in the morning can mean bad breath and furry      teeth, right? You can combat these foes easily by brushing      with "tooth soda," a teaspoon or so of baking soda mixed      with an equal part of salt and topped off with two drops of      oil of peppermint. <em>Now</em> doesn't your mouth feel      fresher? <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: One of our editors found that      this recipe also erased coffee and tea stains from tooth      enamel.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Next on your agenda is livening up that old sleep-filled      face. If your skin is oily, wash it with uncooked oatmeal      (or bran plus a tad of baking soda) blended with just      enough water to make a paste. Massage this into your face      and neck . . rinse it off with warm water ...and, using a      cotton pad, rub on an astringent made of equal parts of      water and apple cider vinegar. If you have dry skin,      squeeze the juice from one lemon and one tomato into a dish      and add an equal amount of almond oil (or safflower,      apricot kernel, or any other pure vegetable oil you may      have on hand). Gently massage this rich formula into your      face and neck, then rinse it off with tepid water. For an      astringent that will get rid of all the excess oil, try      swabbing on plain old witch hazel.    </p>    <p>      OK, now that your face is awake, jump into the shower and      lather up the rest of your skin with pure and gentle      castile soap. Here's a recipe that will make your castile      go further: Mix 3/4 cup of almond meal with 1/2 cup of rice      powder and 1-1/4 cups of the shaved soap; store this in a      tightly sealed jar. When you want to use it, simply lather      it up in your hands with warm water.    </p>    <p>      While you're in the shower, what about a shampoo? Almond      meal adds nutrients and oil to your hair while cleansing      it, so wet your crowning glory and, applying small handfuls      of the meal at a time, rub the gritty stuff into your hair      and scalp while adding water to work up a good lather.      (This takes a little longer than with ordinary soap, but      it's worth it.) For a rinse, use a tablespoon of apple      cider vinegar or lemon juice diluted in one quart of water.      If your hair's oily, you may want to towel it dry and then      apply watered-down witch hazel with cotton pads.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>NIGHTLY REFRESHMENT</strong></strong>    </p>    <p>      Got a special event to go to this evening? But-what's      that?-you were up all last night with a sick child, and one      glance in the mirror tells you that today you don't just      <em>feel</em> frazzled, you look it? Don't worry: All you      need are a few extra beauty tricks to add to your normal      routine to pull you together and make you glow.    </p>    <p>      First, smooth a little milk under your weary eyes to remove      any puffiness. Let it dry, then repeat the treatment. While      your eyes are resting, soften and smooth your elbows by      letting each rest on the cut side of a halved lemon for      about ten minutes.    </p>    <p>      Next, relax in a nice warm bath that's lightly laced with      the juice of a fresh grapefruit. This will not only refresh      you but, because of the citrus's slight bleaching effect,      will do wonders for tired, sallow skin.    </p>    <p>      After your bath, put your feet up and read a book or listen      to Chopin while a stimulating natural mask feeds your skin      and really boosts your complexion with its astringent      powers.    </p>    <p>      Before you put on a mask, though, be sure your face is      ready for it. Gently massage your skin and splash on a      little warm water so your pores will be open and receptive.      Restive Here are a few mask recipes.    </p>    <p>      For normal skin, mix 1 tablespoon of wheat germ with 1      tablespoon of honey. Apply the creation liberally, leave it      on for about 20 minutes (or until your face feels tight and      tingly), then rinse the mask off with cold water. After      removing all traces of it, pat on ice-cold water to close      your pores again.    </p>    <p>      Delicate skin will practically purr with pleasure beneath a      mask made from a few dried apricot pieces blended with an      equal amount of honey. Let the mask stay on your face for      20 minutes, then wash it off ...first with warm, then with      cold, water. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Facial masks are slightly      drying, so you may want to smooth on an emollient or lotion      after using one. Almond oil mixed with a drop or two of      scented oil -such as sandalwood, rose, or whatever      you prefer feels pleasant.]</em>    </p>    <p>      Create a complexion mask for oily skin by adding just      enough milk to a cup (or so) of uncooked oatmeal to make a      paste. After spreading this concoction on your face, wait      10 to 15 minutes and then wash it off.    </p>    <p>      <em>Now,</em> after you've had a luxurious shower or bath      and a facial, don't you feel battery You're rested and      relaxed, your skin's all aglow, and you're ready for that      night on the town! Later, when you' come home, unwind with      a cup of rose hip or chamomile tea. As you sit back and      sip, place the tea bags (or cotton pads soaked in the tea)      over your eyelids to ward off or ease redness and      puffiness.    </p>    <p>      Then, before going to bed, try dabbing on just a little      plain mayonnaise. The natural emollients in this creamy      dressing will soothe you right off to sleep.    </p>    <p>      And there you have a full day's quota of back-to-basics      cosmetics. Frivolous? Perhaps. But once you get started,      you'll find that at least occasionally devoting yourself to      the cultivation of your "natural beauty" can be      spirit-lifting and harmless fun!    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: With a "patch test, " check for allergies to      any ingredients you've never used before: Put a little of      the substance on the sensitive skin inside your elbow, and      cover it loosely with a Band-Aid for 24 hours. If your skin      shows no sign of irritation after that time, the ingredient      is probably safe for you to use.    </p>    <p>      For further reading on natural cosmetics, Jeanne Rose's      books can't be beat.
