                    <p>      IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT      BETWEEN 1.7 MILLION AND 8.8 MILLION METRIC TONS OF      PETROLEUM ARE SPEWED INTO THE OCEANS EACH YEAR , says a      study released by the National Research Council. Although      tanker mishaps and offshore operations account for some      marine oil pollution-0.4 and 0.05 metric tons a year      (mta) respectively-the biggest contributions come      from more chronic sources: routine tanker operations (0.7      mta), municipal wastes (0.7 mta), other runoff and wastes      (0.5 mta), marine bilge and fuel oils (0.3 mta), and      petroleum carried in rainwater or the atmosphere (0.3      mta).<br />      <br />      MEANWHILE, THINGS AREN'T ANY BETTER HERE ON DRY LAND:      According to an article in Technology Review , more than 1      billion gallons of used lubricants are generated in the      United States annually-and about half, some 500      million gallons, are dumped directly into the environment      in landfills and through other improper disposal methods.      Worse yet, the most common offenders by far are those of us      who change the oil in our own automobiles. Of the 350      million gallons of oil drained from crankcases by      do-it-yourselfers each year, only about 18% is recycled or      burned as fuel. Forty percent is poured directly into the      ground, and another 20% is dumped in the garbage (the      remaining 22% is essentially unaccounted for). If you're      guilty of contributing to the problem, stop now: Some      service station operators will gladly take your used      crankcase oil and recycle or dispose of it properly.<br />      <br />      ALL IS NOT ROSY AT THE WORLD'S LARGEST ETHANOL PRODUCTION      PLANT in South Bend, Indiana. As we mentioned in this      column in issue 93, the $186 million facility can convert      20 million bushels of corn into more than a million gallons      of fuel ethanol each week. Unfortunately, the plant also      produces a powerful, offensive odor-a problem that      the citizens' group CEASE (Committee of Environmentalists      Against the Stench of Ethanol) has no intention of      tolerating. While New Energy Company of Indiana, the      plant's owner, claims that measures to curb the smell would      cost $4 to $5 million-a price the firm says it can't      afford-CEASE points to the odor's detrimental effect      on South Bend's environment and economy, and is threatening      legal action.<br />      <br />      NO SIMPLE FUNERAL FOR THE COUNTRY'S FIRST ATOMIC POWER      PLANT: In 1982, after a quarter century of operation, the      Shippingport Nuclear Reactor-the first such      generating facility in the U.S.-was shut down. After      considerable deliberation over how to dispose of the      radioactive pressurized-water reactor, DOE has decided on a      somewhat elaborate funeral rite. Sometime in mid-1989, the      pressure vessel (which contains the "hot" core) will be      lifted by a crane, encased in concrete, and loaded onto a      barge on the Ohio River. From there, the 770-metric-ton      corpse will travel to the Gulf of Mexico, through the      Panama Canal, and up the West Coast to its final resting      place: a large pit at the nuclear waste disposal site at      Hanford, Washington. Total cost: $100 million. And not      incidentally, 15 more U.S. reactors are due to be similarly      decommissioned by the year 2000.<br />      <br />      HOW MUCH HAVE CARBON DIOXIDE LEVELS IN THE ATMOSPHERE      CHANGED SINCE THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION? To answer that      question, scientists at the University of Bern in      Switzerland studied ice core samples taken from 200 meters      below the surface of western Antarctica. Their findings:      Around the year 1750, atmospheric CO, levels amounted to      about 280 parts per million. In 1984, CO, concentrations      measured about 345 ppm-a whopping 22% increase, and a      disturbing indication that predictions of the greenhouse      effect (a global warming trend caused by the trapping of      heat by carbon dioxide) could be all too accurate.<br />      <br />      OPEC MAY BE FLOUNDERING NOW, BUT IT'LL BE STRONGER THAN      EVER IN THE NINETIES if the current oil glut causes a      reversal of conservation trends, according to a report by      The Worldwatch Institute (1776 Massachusetts Ave. N.W.,      Washington, D.C. 20036). Although increased oil production      by non-OPEC countries-particularly Mexico, Great Britain,      and the U.S.-has helped to weaken the OPEC cartel,      the stage is being set for another turning of the tables.      "OPEC is producing only half as much oil as it did four      years ago," says Christopher Flavin, author of the study,      "while outside OPEC, oil reserves are being drained more      quickly than ever." Noting that Middle Eastern OPEC nations      have 56% of the world's oil, Flavin points out that "at the      1984 extraction rate, U.S. oil reserves would last only      nine years, while Saudi reserves would last 100 years."      Ironically, today's plummeting petroleum prices-due      in large part to a decade of energy awareness and vastly      improved efficiency-are tending to discourage      investment in renewable energy technologies, worsening the      picture for the decades to come.<br />      <br />      FEDERAL INCOME TAX CREDITS FOR CONSERVATION AND RENEWABLE      ENERGY EQUIPMENT END ON<br />      DECEMBER 31. Despite repeated efforts to gain an extension      of the credits-which have been largely responsible      for the growth of today's renewable energy industry and      have enabled thousands of Americans to reduce their      consumption of electricity and fossil fuels-the tax      incentives created as part of the National Energy Act of      1978 will cease at the end of this year.    </p>
