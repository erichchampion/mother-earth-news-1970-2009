                    <p>      Clamp this simple spritsail onto any small, square-sterned      rowboat or dinghy (such as the build-your own model      featured in our last issue), and-presto-you'll      have yourself a fine little wind cruiser! The rig, though      admittedly not quite as efficient ( <em>or</em>      complicated) as those on "real" sailboats, performs nicely      on a broad reach, and with a good breeze can even bring a      boat around to tack at about 30Â° into the wind.      Moreover, since the mast, boom, and rudder work as a single      unit, even a novice can readily master the sail's      operation.    </p>    <p>      By following the drawings, you should be able to assemble      the entire pusher sail for no more than $45. Those of you      who'd prefer to work with larger-scale drawings than we're      able to present here, or who are also interested in      constructing the plywood dinghy featured in MOTHER NO. 95,      may want to purchase a complete set of plans that detail      the building of both units. The plans are available for      $10.00 plus $1.98 shipping and handling from Boat Plans,      THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> PLANS, P.O.
