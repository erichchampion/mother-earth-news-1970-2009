                    <h5 id="byline">      by Geoffrey Proust    </h5>    <p>      My wife, Barbara, and I operate a stained-glass business      out of our home studio . . . and although we both enjoy      combining the independence of self-employment with the      creativity of artistic endeavor, our craft does present us      with a special problem.<br />      <br />      Working with stained glass, you see, exposes us to toxic      lead vapors given off in the joint-soldering process, as      well as fumes from flux. Lead is an especially nocuous      poison because it accumulates in the body with each      exposure and can eventually result in anemia, kidney      dysfunction, and even permanent brain damage.<br />      <br />      Clearly, a solution was required. It was obvious that      simply forcing air across the workbench and into another      part of the studio wasn't the answer, nor was relying upon      a household window fan to do a major ventilation job. But      the variable-position exhaust system I made (using a      swing-arm incandescent desk lamp, a plastic bucket, some      ducting, and a blower) provides positive suction and      removal of the offending vapors at any point within a      6'-diameter circle on our table . . . at a cost (less than      $45) that even a hobbyist could justify.<br />      <br />      The system I devised consists of two components: the      suction apparatus and the movable support arm for the      suction head. The lat ter is just a swiveling all-position      arm lamp of the kind frequently used for drafting and      design work. To convert it, I drilled out the rivets that      held the shade to its mount, removed the electrical parts      (by clipping the plug and drawing the wire through the      arms), and fastened a 7"-diameter plastic ice cream bucket      in place of the shade, using No. 6 X 1/2" machine screws. A      4" opening cut into the bottom of the bucket accommodates      the flexible suction tube.<br />      <br />      The air-handling apparatus is almost as straightforward.      Once I'd established where I wanted to bolt my support arm      (a table-edge mount allows a 180° sweep, while a      centrally located base provides a full 360° reach), I      hung enough 6" round galvanized ducting overhead to reach      from the nearest outside wall to a point above the arm.      Then I attached about 7 feet of 4" flexible clothes-dryer      hose to the hole in the plastic suction head and used a      4"-to-6" adapter to connect the hose's opposite end to the      duct.<br />      <br />      My exhaust fan is a used 2.9-amp squirrel cage blower with      a free-air delivery rate of 350 cubic feet per minute      (Dayton No. 2C841). Centrifugal fans are usually designed      to blow, rather than draw, air, but I installed a 6"-duct      adapter plate to its inlet anyway. By using the oversized      duct, keeping its length and the number of elbows in it to      a minimum, and cracking open a window to allow vented air      to be replaced, I figure I've made an acceptable compromise      between efficiency and cost. (One particular fan that's      made just for ducted systems-the Dayton      1C791-costs over $100.) To install it, I cut an      opening in the exterior wall, mounted the blower, and used      a wall cap on the outside to cover and protect the exhaust      outlet.<br />      <br />      Naturally, my ventilation system would work with fumes,      vapors, smoke, or anything without sizable particulate      matter in it. But if the substance you're venting is      flammable, be certain that the fan you choose is a      nonsparking "explosion-proof" type, even though it'll cost      more; by the same token, dusty substances will demand a      sealed motor with greater power.    </p>
