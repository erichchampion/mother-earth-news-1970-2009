                      <h5 id="byline">by Jody M. Wright and MOTHER's staff</h5>        <p>      It sometimes seems a shame that the whole wonderful panoply      of Christmas is fated to charm us for a few all-too-short      days, and then the sparkling ornaments, colored lights,      well-stuffed stockings, and other decorations sit in boxes,      unused, for the next eleven months. I was following this      line of thought one day and came up with the idea of a      stocking/ puppet. One side would be a beautiful Christmas      stocking-either in red or in a nontraditional      fabric-but turn it inside out and you'd find a      delightful horse puppet. The stocking itself would brighten      any child's (or adult's) holiday, but long after, when the      candies, fruits, and presents that once filled it were      memories, a perky pony playfellow would remain to accompany      the youngster on many imaginary journeys.    </p>    <h3>      PLAIN AND FANCY FIXINGS    </h3>    <p>      I fashioned my stocking/puppets from new fabric, but you      could make yours from any colorful scraps you have on hand.      I'll give you directions for sewing the complete gift with      the stocking side in "designer" fabric, then tell you how      to make the more traditional version.<br />      <br />      To duplicate my patchwork example, you'll need the      following materials: 1/2 yard each of maroon, maroon      calico, and beige cotton fabric; 1/2 yard of polyester      batting (I've found that worn-out cotton mattress pads are      a great substitute); a small scrap of solid brown fabric      for the ear linings; a 2" X 19" strip of dark brown felt,      plus enough of the same felt for two eyes approximately      1-1/2" in diameter (the strip can be pieced, if necessary);      maroon, beige, and dark brown or black thread; and a      pattern taken from the diagram shown. To enlarge the      diagram to a full-size pattern, rule a 1" grid on a sheet      of brown wrapping paper that's at least 17" X 21 ", or use      1" graph paper. Then, following the diagram, copy the      design one square at a time onto the paper (a 3/8" seam      allowance is already included). Cut out the pieces and      identify them for future reference: You may want to sew      lots of stocking/puppets as gifts!    </p>        <p>      <strong>CUTTING REMARKS<br /></strong> Using your paper      pattern pieces pinned to the material, cut out two ears      from the solid brown fabric, two stockings and two ears      from the solid beige fabric, one stocking and four strips      from the solid maroon, five strips from the maroon calico,      two stockings from the polyester batting, and the mane and      eyes from the dark brown felt. If the beige fabric has a      wrong and a right side, be sure to reverse the stocking      pattern so you'll end up with two matching sides when      they're sewn together.    </p>    <h3>      MAKING (IT) UP    </h3>    <p>      Begin by sewing the strips together: Take one strip of      calico and one of maroon, pin them with their right sides      together, and stitch down the length of one side. Continue      in this manner, alternating solid and calico strips, until      all the strips have been sewn. After pressing the seams      open, pin the stocking pattern to the patchwork rectangle      and cut out one stocking. Again, remember to flip the      pattern on the material so that the completed stocking will      have the right sides of the fabrics facing out.<br />      <br />      Next, lay one piece of batting on the wrong side of the      patchwork stocking and pin or baste it in place. Do the      same with the maroon stocking, then pin it to the patchwork      one, right sides together. Leaving the stocking top open,      baste and then stitch the two halves together. Remove any      basting stitches, clip all curves, and trim the batting to      about 1/8" from the seam.<br />      <br />      Now let's make the puppet. Pin the felt mane, with the      fringed edge pointing inward, onto the right side of one      beige stocking piece. Pin the second beige stocking piece      to the first, right sides together, and then stitch around      the horse, leaving the bottom open (this opening, of      course, corresponds to the top of the stocking). Clip all      the curves, and turn the horse right side out.<br />      <br />      Match one piece of brown to a piece of beige to form each      ear. Stitch the sides, clip the curves, and turn the ears      right side out. Turn the raw edges in at the bottom, and      sew the folded edges together with a running or slip      stitch. Now, fold each ear lengthwise, slightly off center,      with the brown lining inside. Hand-stitch the folded ear in      place below the mane so that it points forward. (If you      have it, slip a piece of fairly stiff plastic inside the      horse's head to act as a darning egg to prevent your needle      from poking all the way through the puppet as you sew.)      Take several small stitches about one-third of the way up      the back of each ear to hold it close to the head. Position      the felt circles for the eyes, and sew them in place using      a blanket stitch. A line of white thread from the center of      each eye to the rim will help to give your horse a lifelike      expression.<br />      <br />      Finally, fit the stocking-wrong side out-inside      the puppet, making sure that the seams of both pieces line      up. Fold the unseamed edge of the stocking over that of the      puppet, turn under the raw edges, and hand-stitch them to      make a narrow hem.</p>      <h3>A TRADITIONAL RED STOCKING</h3>      <p>      To make a more conventional Christmas stocking, you'll need      1/2 yard of red flannel and a 17" X 3-1/2" strip of white      fake fur to replace the maroon and calico fabrics, and red      thread instead of maroon. Cut two stocking pieces from the      flannel, and cut the polyester batting and the parts for      the horse as described above. Pin each batting stocking to      a flannel one, making sure there are two corresponding      halves. With the flannel pieces together and the batting on      the outside, pin, baste (don't skip this step), and stitch      the halves together, leaving the top open. Trim the batting      1/8" from the seam and clip all the curves.<br />      <br />      Make the horse from the instructions already given. Then      insert the flannel stocking, inside out, into the puppet.      Match the seams and the open edges, and pin the two      sections together around the opening. Next, pin the fur      strip-right side against the puppet-around the      edge of the opening. Baste a seam over the pins and then      sew it. Stitch the fur strip's ends together, and trim the      seam. Trim the batting, too, about 1/8" from the cuff seam.      Now turn the puppet/ stocking inside out so the red flannel      is on the outside. Fold the fur down over the top to make a      generous cuff. Turn the raw edge of the fur under 1/4" and      slip-stitch the cuff to the flannel, being sure the      stitches don't show on the puppet side.    </p>    <h3>      MIX AND MATCH    </h3>        <p>      So, with one simple pattern you can please every child on      your Christmas gift list and, at the same time, produce      lovely decorations that either complement a special holiday      decor or add to the traditional color scheme of the season.      Who says that Christmas comes but once a year? With this      stocking/horse puppet, it can be enjoyed all year long!<br />			Two Sewing Tips<br />      1. A milliner's needle-longer than common hand-sewing      needles and available in most sewing departments-may      prove very useful in basting and stitching the polyester      batting and the fur.<br />      2. A 5" X 7" strip of staff but bendable clear plastic,      such as that used to cover windows in wintertime, will      greatly simpli fy the business of attaching the eyes and      the ears.    </p>
