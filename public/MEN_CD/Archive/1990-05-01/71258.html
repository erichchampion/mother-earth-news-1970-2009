            <p>      Issue # 123 May/June 1990    </p>    <p>      <strong>DISPATCHES</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Ben Finney    </h5>        <p>      <em>A plan to tap the volcanic energy of Hawaii's Big      Island for domestic use is encountering rough surf.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Hawaii seems perfect for geothermal power-at least to      the politicians, planners, engineers and builders who seek      to reduce the state's more than 90% dependence</em> on      imported oil. As an archipelago of recent volcanic origin,      Hawaii has no fossil fuels to bum, but it <em>does</em>      have an ever-growing demand for energy. The      geotechnological solution to this oil dependency is to      exploit the very source of the islands diemselves--the      magma from a "hot spot" lying below the earth's surface. By      periodically punching through the Pacific Plate as it      slowly slides northwest toward Asia, the magma cooled and      formed (and is still forming) the Hawaiian chain. The      southeasternmost and youngest island of the chain, the Big      Island of Hawaii, sits right over this hot spot and boasts      active volcanoes through which erupting lava constantly      adds to the island's real estate. In the depths of a rift      zone leading from Kilauea volcano, magma superheats a      deposit of water, which when piped up to die surface and      converted into high-pressure steam is capable of driving      powerful turbine generators.    </p>    <p>      Electricity from volcanoes would not only reduce oil      dependency and hence the state's vulnerability to outside      forces, it would also play a small but positive part in      slowing CO 2 buildup from fossil fuels and the accompanying      global warning. (Unchecked, this warming could result in      the inundation of Hawaii"s famed coastline, where most of      its people live.) So an ambitious initiative is now under      way to develop a series of geothermal stations on die Big      Island to produce some 500 megawatts of electricity, much      of which would be exported via an undersea cable to the      island of Oahu, where 80% of the state's people live.    </p>    <p>      The drilling is not difficult by today's standards.      Geothermal technology is proven, as power plants in Italy,      Iceland, California, New Zealand and other places have      shown. Indeed, a test plant on the Big Island built for      experimental purposes worked well enough to be successfully      hooked into the island's power grid over a period of      several years. So, from the perspective of the engineers      and the planners sitting in Honolulu offices, geothermal is      definitely part of the solution.    </p>    <p>      The trouble is that the Wao Kele Puna rain forest lies over      much of the geothermal zone-the last major lowland tropical      rain forest in the United States, say the      environmentalists, <em>and</em> the abode of the volcano      goddess, Pele, say her Hawaiian worshipers. So, the project      is now embroiled in a tropical variant of NIMBY ("not in my      backyard"). An energy initiative that looks good from a      statewide and global perspective looms as technological      evil incarnate to those who see the rain forest as a unique      and fragile biological resource, and to those who regard      any tampering with the dwelling place of Pele as nothing      less than a desecration.    </p>    <p>      A couple of environmental groups-the Rainforest Action      Network and the Pele Defense Fund-have been pressing the      anti-geothermal case very aggressively through      demonstrations, legal suits taken all the way to the      Supreme Court, newspaper ads and the national media. The      Rainforest Action Network and its local affiliates marshall      a variety of experts to testify how geothermal development      will inevitably destroy the rain forest through road      building, site development and the inadvertent introduction      of exotic noxious gases and fluids. They also raise the      specter of ugly high-power transmission lines strung over      the island and then laid down in waters frequented by      wintering humpback whales, exposing all creatures along the      route, human, cetacean or otherwise, to dangerous      electromagnetic radiation. In addition, they question the      economics of the project, particularly the several billions      of dollars to be spent on the undersea cable, which they      claim is an unproven technology. Their solution to Hawaii's      energy crunch is to reduce consumer demand through a      vigorous campaign for energy efficiency, thereby preserving      the rain forest, reducing the islands' contribution to      global warming and saving the consumer money, to boot.    </p>    <p>      The Pele Defense Fund is a small but vocal group of      Hawaiians, most of them from the Puna district, where the      geothermal stations are being built. Puna, argue these      advocates, is still a very Hawaiian place in a state      otherwise overrun by Americans from the mainland,      foreigners and real estate developers eager to cash in on      the influx of both tourists and new residents. The Puna      Hawaiians, they say, wish to be left in peace to worship      their volcano goddess and maintain their rural lifestyle      away from development, which in their experience has always      meant loss of land and cultural integrity. Why should we,      they ask, sacrifice our forest, our Pele, our lifestyle, so      that the people on Oahu can have more power to build and      air-condition more tourist hotels?    </p>    <p>      Wounded by these charges, government planners and      geothermal engineers cite their own experts, who testify      that environmental and social impacts can be controlled and      mitigated, and that neither the Puna rain forest nor the      power of Pele will be destroyed. Sitting uncomfortably in      the middle of the controversy is John Waihee, the first      indigenous Hawaiian elected governor of the state. While      acknowledging the opposition's case, he has continued to      press for geothermal power as a necessary and desirable      energy initiative. On the other hand, he must often find      himself wishing that magma, rain forest and Pele weren't so      closely associated.    </p>    <p>      <em>Ben Finney is a cultural anthropologist at the      University of Hawaii in Honolulu and a contributing editor      for</em> <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> magazine.    </p>
