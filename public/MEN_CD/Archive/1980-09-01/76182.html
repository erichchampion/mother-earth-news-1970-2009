                    <p>      Even homesteaders need to relax and enjoy themselves from      time to time, right? And almost everybody these days wants      to cut his or her cost of living. So how about a little      doit-yourself entertainment?    </p>    <p>      And that's what this column is all about. Down-home music      that you can make . . . and the instruments (which, in some      cases, you can also make!) to play that music on.    </p>    <p>      The important thing is that this is your column. If you      like it, write to me and let me know. If you have some      ideas for this feature, let me know that. I'm open to any      suggestions or information you care to contribute. I'll      even try to answer your questions about down-home music . .      . but-both for the benefit of all MOTHER's readers      and to ease my correspondence load-I'll deal with      those questions, whenever possible, here in this column . .      . rather than in personal letters.    </p>    <p>      Address your correspondence- for this column and this      column only-to Marc Bristol, 31722 N. E. 180th Place,      Duvall, Wash. 98019.    </p>    <h2 id="subtitle">      Bass and Washboard Update    </h2>        <p>      As almost anybody who's the least bit musically inclined      can tell you, a band wouldn't be complete without bass and      percussion instruments. The rhythm-makers add definition      and focus to any piece of music and seem to make the melody      bounce along more naturally. And, in most      <em>homegrown</em> music, these necessary roles are played      by the washtub bass and the scrubboard . . . two      instruments that I introduced to you in my first column      (back in MOTHER NO. 50).    </p>    <p>      Since that initial article, though, I've picked up a whole      passel of new information on the two homegrown musicmakers      (some of it from readers of this column, and some gathered      during interviews and workshops) . . . and now I'm going to      wrap up all those gleanings into a neat package for you.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEW TUB DESIGN</strong>    </p>    <p>      The first item I'd like to pass along was described to me      by a MOTHER-reader, Kevin Potter. He calls the invention an      upright washtub bass . . . and it's essentially a      banjo-style version of the bull fiddle, which uses the tub      for a "pot".    </p>    <p>      Kevin's creation is a hybrid instrument . . . made partly      from scrounged pieces and partly from elements of a      conventional bass fiddle. The neck of the musicmaker is a      hardwood push-mower handle, and the stand is actually a      chair or table leg. The fiddle's tuning peg, bridge, and      string are the same as those used on a "real" instrument.      (Kevin and I agree that it is possible to make the same      pieces out of any good hardwood scraps ... and that you      could use nylon filament, or even <em>clothesline,</em> for      the string.)    </p>    <p>      In addition, you'll have to find a length of 2" X 3" wood      for a back support (actually, any board that's      <em>close</em> to those dimensions will work, as long as it      comfortably spans the diameter of the tub at the      container's open end). You'll also need a U-shaped brace .      . . which can be welded together out of scraps of steel or      iron. At its open end, this brace straddles the neck of the      instrument and is bolted to it . . . while its closed end      is lag bolted-through the tub-into one end of      the back support (see the accompanying illustration).    </p>    <p>      The mower-handle neck is attached to the tub with wood      screws and a small angle bracket. You'll also need one      turn-buckle per string, a double-ended screw to secure the      chair leg in place (if it didn't come with one of its own),      and a small piece of hardwood to use as a "nut" (where the      strings rest at the top of the neck).    </p>    <p>      You can form the holes to hold your tuning pegs by one of      two methods. On <em>his</em> project, Kevin employed a      series of six different drill bits . . . boring about 1/4"      deeper with each successively small er bit.      Another-and equally effective-way to form the      conical hole is to make the initial bore with the      <em>smallest</em> size bit you have, and then enlarge the      opening with a repairman's tapered hand reamer . . . a tool      which is available at most hardware stores. (The turnbuckle      tailpiece is simply bolted in place through a hole drilled      in the tub's bottom rim.)    </p>    <p>      As you can see from the diagram, the neck tilts slightly      backward from the edge of the "drum". That's to allow for a      taller bridge (which must be set at a height that will keep      the string almost parallel to the neck) . . .      because-as a general rule-the higher the      bridge, the more resonance and volume your instrument will      produce. (If you buy a standard bridge, of course, the      dimensions of that store-bought part will determine the      neck angle on your washtub bass.)    </p>    <p>      The great advantage of Kevin's innovative design is that it      gives you the option of adding extra strings to the      instrument to extend its tonal range. (It's even possible      to make a four-string upright tub bass . . . but if you do      so, you'll need to use a wider piece of wood for the neck.)      The instrument is played like a "real" bull fiddle (not      like the regular gutbucket I described in my original      column) . . . and can also be bowed-if it's fitted      with more than two strings-after you've reshaped the      neck to match a commercially manufactured bridge.    </p>        <p>      <strong>AIRCRAFT CABLE STRING</strong>    </p>    <p>      I picked up some more good ideas on gutbucket design from      Jimmie Fadden of the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band. (Although his      fans probably know Jimmie for his stellar harmonica      work-particularly his performance on "Will the Circle      Be Unbroken?"-he used to play the tub bass back when      the group was just a fledgling jug band!)    </p>    <p>      The key feature of Fadden's instrument design is the use of      1/16" stainless steel aircraft cable for string. The strong      filament-which can be bought "readymade" with a steel      ball attached to one end-is secured to the tub bottom      by means of a scrounged bicycle brake adjuster. First,      drill an appropriate-sized opening in the center of your      washtub's bottom. Then pass the aircraft cable through the      open shaft of the bike part . . . and fit that tube into      the hole. The unit is attached to the bottom of the tub      with a two-inch-diameter plywood washer and a matching felt      washer that are glued together. Last of all, tighten the      whole assembly-on the "outside" of the tub's      floor-using the nut that came with the brake adjuster      (see the drawing for details).    </p>    <p>      At the opposite end of the cable-near the top of the      instrument's neck-Jimmie uses a length of      small-diameter copper tubing to reinforce the hole where      the string passes through the neck. And, to make a secure      "tuning machine", the musician employs a bolt . . . with a      hole drilled in its center large enough to accommodate the      cable. Two nuts are fastened onto the bolt (one on either      side of the cable), and the whole unit is screwed into the      side of the neck. Then when the musician tunes his bass,      the string will wrap around the bolt and stay clamped      between the nuts. This creates a fairly permanent situation      . . . as opposed to the commonly used "wrapped and knotted"      clothesline method, with which the string tends to slip and      even has to be retied occasionally.    </p>    <p>      While we're on the subject, I'd like to add a word or two      about strings: In my original column on washtubs, I said      that -among other choices of materials-you      could use a regular gut D string. Well, since then I've      seen musicians using G's and A's, too. The pitch,      therefore, doesn't seem to matter much . . . just as long      as the string is noncoated. The size of the string will be      up to you . . . and will probably depend on how large a tub      your instrument has.    </p>    <p>      A further warning: If you're going to play tub bass during      along jam session, you might want to wrap your plucking      fingers with adhesive tape to keep them from blistering.      During his gutbucket stomp days, Jimmie also wore a heavy      canvas glove on his nonpickin' hand, with pads of thick      leather sewn across the fingers at the point where they      touch the string. He says that a groove quickly wears into      the leather, making it easy to maintain that same point of      contact. (If you use this technique, you might like to      follow Jimmie's example further, and cut off the ends of      the glove's fingers for natural air conditioning.)    </p>        <p>      <strong>THE LATEST ON WASHBOARDS</strong>    </p>    <p>      As I've mentioned in this column before, Billy Hults and I      are working on a book about washboard construction and      playing technique. In the course of our research, we've had      a chance to speak with some of the best designers and      players of the homegrown instrument . . . and we've learned      a great deal from the conversations.    </p>    <p>      For instance, I originally reported to you that brass      scrubboards have the best tone. Well, since that time I've      heard all kinds played . . . and I've come to the      conclusion that-as far as sound is concerned, at      least-your choice of materials should be purely a      matter of taste. (Even the bass models don't all sound the      same, partly because of differences in back bracing.)    </p>    <p>      In fact, Jeff Hanna (another member of the Dirt Band)      swears by his own enameled steel model, which has a sharper      tone than brass and-according to Jeff-lasts      longer than do boards made of any other material. (All the      fulltime washboard players I know wear out their brass      models in fairly short order.) I also discovered      that-contrary to my earlier opinion-glass      washboards can produce good percussion effects. (This      revelation came from Rich Kuras of Corvallis, Oregon, who      plays his unusual scrubber with plastic guitar picks.)    </p>    <p>      <strong>NIMBLE THIMBLES</strong>    </p>    <p>      As you may know, the most common method of playing the      washboard is with thimbles . . . but many performers find      it difficult to keep the little finger-protectors in place.      Some folks actually tape them onto the ends of their      fingers so the "digit guards" won't fall off in the middle      of a fast song! However, that method just isn't convenient      for multi-instrument musicians.    </p>    <p>      My friend Todd Parks has devised one solution to the      problem: He simply epoxy-glued his thimbles onto the      fingertips of a pair of light cotton gloves . . . so now      Todd can whip off the mitts and pick up another instrument      in jig time!    </p>    <p>      My own answer to that dilemma involves, of all things, a      fishing tackle box! First, I drill four holes into each of      two separate blocks of wood, making sure the bores are big      enough to hold standardsize thimbles <em>and</em> that      they're arranged at intervals that have about the same      spacing as do my outspread fingers. Then I drop one      thimble-open end up into each hole, and fit the wooden      blocks into the upper compartment of the tackle box. With      my box beside me, I can easily stick my fingers down into      the thimbles . . . and instantly be ready to play!    </p>    <p>      <strong>STAY TUNED</strong>    </p>    <p>      I hope to have available-very soon-both the      washboard book Billy and I have been working on      <em>and</em> the Homegrown Music album mentioned in several      of my earlier columns. These resources should provide a lot      of information-not to mention some good of down-home      entertainment-for folks interested in making and      playing their own instruments.    </p>    <p>      But we still need help on the projects. So if you'd like to      contribute anything (in the way of photos, discography      info, or song arrangements) to the record or the book, drop      me a line. Your help will be appreciated . . . and I'll be      sure to let you know when the products are ready to go.    </p>
