                    <p>      MOTHER's Eco-Village orchard-keepers tell you how to do it      right.    </p>        <p>      1.<strong>HEELING IN:</strong> If you aren't able to plant      your tree as soon as you buy or receive it, you should      "heel in" the newcomer. To do so, dig a trough-at a      45° angle-that's deep enough at its lower end to      completely contain the tree's roots. Put the      fruit-bearer-to-be in the trench, and cover its roots with      soil. (This step isn't necessary if your tree has a wrapped      soil ball around its roots when purchased.) The important      thing is not to let the roots dry out!    </p>        <p>      2. <strong>PREWATERING:</strong> A full day prior to      planting, thoroughly soak the area where the tree's hole is      to be dug.    </p>    <p>      3. <strong>DIGGING:</strong> Measure the depth and width of      the root cluster, then-separating the top soil and      subsoil as you go-dig a hole that exceeds (slightly)      those dimensions. When the pit is dug, rough up its sides      with your shovel or fork (to give the plant places to grip      as it spreads underground . . . if this isn't done, the new      growth may simply circle in the hole causing the plant to      become rootbound).    </p>    <p>      4. <strong>VERTEBRATE PEST CONTROL:</strong> If gophers,      moles, or the like are a problem in your area, you can line      the pit-on its sides and bottom-with a "basket"      made from chicken wire.    </p>        <p>      5. <strong>PLACING THE TREE:</strong> Build a small mound      of loose topsoil in the bottom of the pit, and drape the      spreading root structure over the hill. Turn the tree so      that the bud union (if your tree has been grafted to a      different, usually dwarf, rootstock) will be facing toward      your area's prevailing winds . . . and-if your locale      is often visited by really hearty gusts-position the      trunk to lean slightly into the wind.    </p>    <p>      6. <strong>FILLING THE HOLE:</strong> Then, making sure the      graft (if your tree has one) will be above the ground after      planting, put the rest of the topsoil in the bottom of the      hole and fill the pit-to about the three-quarter mark      -with subsoil. (The purpose of this "earth reversal",      of course, is to place the richer topsoil where the roots      can reach it right away.) With that done, flood the      remainder of the hole with water, wait until the liquid      soaks in, and tamp the earth down well.    </p>        <p>      7. <strong>PAINTING THE TRUNK:</strong> Apply a coat of      white latex interior paint, covering the trunk from the      ground level (in the three-quarter-full hole) to point just      below the first branch or-where      appropriate-about two inches above graft. (This will      discourage borers and prevent premature leafing and winter      sunscald.)    </p>    <p>      8. <strong>FILLING:</strong> Finish placing the subsoil in      the hole, and-while doing so-build the earth up      to form a mound in the center (around the tree's trunk) and      a shallow trench along the perimeter of the dug-up area.    </p>        <p>      9. <strong>STAKING:</strong> If your tree has been grafted      to dwarf or semidwarf rootstock, you'll w ant to stake it .      . . as its shallow roots could be ripped from the ground in      a heavy wind. To do so, simply position a sturdy support      stick-which, after it's driven into the ground,      should stand at least as high as the tree's first      limb-at a point just beyond the outer edges of the      root ball. (Don't, however, use a newly creosoted stake.)      Then fasten the tree to the support with strips of cloth or      lengths of rubber hose, looping them around the plant about      two-thirds of the way up its trunk.    </p>        <p>      10. <strong>ABOVEGROUND VERTEBRATE PROTECTION:</strong>      Protect the tree's trunk from nibbling rabbits, hungry      deer, scratching cats, playful puppies, and so forth by      giving it a 24" (approximately) collar of hardware cloth,      chicken wire, or the prefabricated tubing available at      nurseries.    </p>    <p>      11. <strong>PRUNING:</strong> MOTHER's tree culturists feel      that it's not usually necessary to prune fall-planted trees      . . . unless limbs have been damaged. In that case, the      branches should be cut off below (that is, to the "tree"      side of) the break.    </p>    <p>      12. <strong>MULCHING:</strong> Now surround the newly      planted fruit producer with a water-conserving layer of      crushed rock, leaf mold, wood chips, or even freshly cut      grass clippings (use the latter only if no herbicides have      been sprayed on the lawn . . . and even then, spread the      material no deeper than two inches) . . . and give your new      friend another good soaking. (You might, at this time, want      to sit down next to the tree and give it a few words of      encouragement. After all, you're asking it to spend its      life with you!)    </p>
