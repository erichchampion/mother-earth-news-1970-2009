    <p>
                        <p>      A good many of you folks have let us know just how much you      enjoy the down-to-earth, practical, bootstrap business      articles that are featured in each and every issue of this      publication. Furthermore, lots of you also tell us that you      actually use the information in our stories to form      successful shoestring enterprises!    </p>    <p>      Well, because <em>MOTHER</em> realizes that good sound      entrepreneurial advice is often hard for the bootstrapper      to come by, we've asked Dan Ogden to produce a regular      column detailing just that sort of how-to-do-it home      business information. (And Dan is certainly qualified to      offer such advice. After all, he entered into his first      business venture in 1976 with an initial investment of $850      and, by the time he decided to look for a new challenge in      1979, found that he'd helped to build a      three-million-dollar enterprise!)    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO GET A LOAN</strong> <strong>FROM A      BANKER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Financing seems to be a problem for many folks who are in      the process of starting up in business. Of course,      "financing" is just a $2.00 word for "money" . . .      and-in this first column-I'm going to tell you      just how to go about borrowing some cash to back your      particular bright idea.    </p>    <p>      Your first task will be to find the right banker. Keep in      mind that such men and women can't make any cash for their      institutions unless they first lend money to someone else .      . . and remember, too, that riskier loans generally bring      in higher interest rates. So, while you may be presenting      the moneylender with a loan idea that's less of a sure      thing than-say-a real estate mortgage, you're      also giving him or her the chance to make a lot more money      in interest charges!    </p>    <p>      But just how do you go about "shopping" for a banker? Well,      the best way to do so is by asking other entrepreneurs to      tell you who helped them get started. Every business has to      begin somewhere, and chances are you'll find out about      ventures that began with the help of a local banker. Banks      tend to specialize in their dealings, too, and your      questions should soon lead you to someone who likes to      cater to the needs of small business folk.    </p>    <p>      However, after you locate a banker-even if he or she      is experienced with and sympathetic to the needs of home      businesses, and has a track record of lending money to such      ventures-your loan will depend upon your ability to      present that man or woman (who, thanks to your shopping,      will at least be willing to listen) with a reasonable      proposal. Now, the factor determining the success or      failure of such a proposition is frequently not so much its      specific content as it is the manner in which it's      presented.    </p>    <p>      I called the president of a local (Connecticut) lending      institution-the fellow's n ame is Jim Banks . . .      he's one of those "good" lenders and often goes out of his      way to help small businesses-to ask him what he looks      for in a loan seeker.    </p>    <p>      "The most important thing is evidence that the applicant      has thought the business out," Jim told me. "I want to see      that his or her plans are realistic and somewhat detailed.      The loan-seeker should present a monthly cash flow      projection, a business plan, a personal resume, and a      personal balance sheet."    </p>    <p>      <strong>HERE'S HOW IT'S DONE</strong>    </p>    <p>      As Jim says, a monthly cash flow projection is one of the      basic "tools" of the finance-seeking businessperson. The      document shows the banker that you've put some thought into      your business idea. (The example that accompanies this      article has been kept simple enough to be applicable to      almost any business.)    </p>    <p>      Now when you present your projection to the banker, you      won't have the $2,000-or whatever figure fits your      needs-in starting cash shown at the top of the list      (this is the money you're there to borrow ... it's called      "working capital", or the amount that's on hand to pay      bills before your business starts bringing in cash). You      simply have to be able to show him or her that a loan of      $2,000 would give you the necessary working capital. You      should also be able to show-with your cash flow      figures-that your income will be great enough to pay      off the loan within a specific period of time.    </p>    <p>      The business plan is a description of your market (telling      which people, where, will buy from you . . . and why), your      services or products, your means of attracting customers,      and your plans for managing the business. The more detailed      this summary is, the better your chances of obtain ing a      loan will be . . . the plan ought to easily fill up a      couple of typed, double-spaced pages.    </p>    <p>      Most folks think of the personal resume as being useful      only when looking for a job. But the relationship between      employer and employee has a lot in common with that between      banker and businessman or -woman. The person lending you      money will want to know just who it is that he or she is      dealing with!    </p>    <p>      The most important factor in preparing your personal      <em>balance sheet</em> (which will list what you own and      what you owe) is accuracy. Don't overlook assets such as      autos, furnishings, etc.-most folks are "worth" more      than they think-but don't try to inflate your wealth,      either. The worst thing you can do when seeking a loan is      to appear unrealistic in your approach to money. If your      balance sheet shows you to be nearly broke, the fact that      you're willing to face up to the unfortunate state of      affairs may have greater influence on the banker than does      the size of your bank account!    </p>    <p>      This last point leads me to the most important ingredient      in all segments of your presentation: HONESTY. <em>Don't      try</em> to look better off than you are . . . don't hide      business failures in your background <em>. . . don't</em>      overstate your financial projections ... and <em>don't</em>      ask for more money than you need, thinking the banker will      reduce the amount automatically.    </p>    <p>      In conclusion, always remember-when trying to secure      a loan-that you'll be dealing with a reasonable human      being who, at the outset, is probably every bit as      interested in saying "yes" as in saying "no". If you've      prepared your "case" well <em>(and if</em> you present it      with a positive attitude and genuine, but controlled,      enthusiasm), the odds are that you will find a banker who's      willing to join you in your exciting vision of the future.      Good hunting!    </p>       <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Dan is working on a number of projects that      should be of great interest to MOTHER's entrepreneurs . . .      including perhaps a real in-depth subscription newsletter,      a series of home business manuals and handbooks, and more.
