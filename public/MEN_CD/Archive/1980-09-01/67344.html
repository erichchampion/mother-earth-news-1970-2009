                    <p>      In MOTHER NO. 63 (page 134), T .J. Byers described how he      rigged up an electrical circuit between his water tank and      his home so he'd know-at a glance-just how much      water he had in his storage tank.    </p>    <p>      Well, Noel Stone of Powell River, British Columbia has come      up with a different homemade water watcher . . . one that      is not as exact as Mr. Byers' invention, but sure does let      the Canadian know when his cistern's starting to run low.    </p>    <p>      Noel constructed a simple "fluid flag" by tying an empty      plastic bleach bottle and a small red banner to opposite      ends of along pole. Then he put a large spike through the      stick's center (to provide a rotation point for his device)      and attached that nail to the inside of his holding tank.      That way, whenever the water level of the storage facility      drops, the float bottle descends and the flag rises . . .      until-eventually-the signal pokes out the top      of the tank . . . telling Noel that he'd better start      cutting back on his water use!    </p>
