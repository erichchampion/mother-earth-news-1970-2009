        Top to Bottom: ... The ""tools of the trade"" for Dutch oven cookery include a pair of curved pliers (for removing the lid and lifting the pot), a wooden spoon (for stirring), and a shovel (for digging the pit and moving coals) ... Dig a hole large enough to hold the iron utensil for slow underground cooking ...Several small stones, placed in the bottom of the oven, will make an even baking platform ... For a delicious dessert, sliced apples are placed in the oven ... topped with a mixture of cinnamon, flour and raisins ... and baked quickly, once the utensil's lid is heaped with coals ... You can make stew in the versatile cooker.
