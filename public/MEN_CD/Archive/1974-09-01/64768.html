    <p>
            		        <h3>      black walnut    </h3>        <p>      The black walnut, one of our most valued hardwoods, is      found over most of the eastern half of the United States      from southern New England to southern Georgia. The tree is      a majestic sight, towering 70 to 100 feet and covered with      graceful sprays of leaflets. If you have one on your land,      treasure it . . . they're becoming scarce.    </p>    <p>      The heavy wood is prized for cabinetmaking and is the      traditional material for fine gunstocks. The sap of both      this species and the butternut can be boiled into syrup and      sugar. Walnut bark is useful in tanning, and the husks      around the nuts yield a long-lasting yellow-brown dye (as      you'll learn if you get the juice on your skin).    </p>    <p>      Lovers of wild foods look forward to October and November,      when the black walnut's big green globes drop to the      ground. The rind is tenacious and not easy to strip from      the freshly gathered nut... but the delicious harvet is      worth the effort.    </p>    <h3>      beech    </h3>        <p>      The beech is a large tree-60 to 80      feet-high-with smooth gray bark and oval leaves. It's      a familiar part of the hardwood forest and also a popular      shade and ornamental species. Very handsome it is, too,      especially in the fall when the foliage turns gold or dark      copper. Beeches are found from southern Canada to east      Texas and south to Florida, but bear more nuts in the      northern part of their range.    </p>    <p>      The hard, strong wood of the beech is made into tool      handles, shoe lasts, woodenware, veneer and inexpensive      furniture. The inner bark has been dried, ground and used      for flour in lean times. Mattresses used to be stuffed with      the leaves, which are springy and last for several seasons.    </p>    <p>      The tree bears small, four-part, bristly burrs that ripen      around October and open to reveal two triangular nuts. The      kernels are tiny, but sweet and nourishing. Roasted and      ground, they're said to make a pleasing coffee substitute.    </p>    <h3>      butternut    </h3>        <p>      The butternut or white walnut looks much like a smaller      black walnut (40 to 80 feet) with lighter colored bark. It      thrives farther north than its larger relation, however,      and grows higher in the mountains.    </p>    <p>      Butternut wood is soft and weak . . . easy to work but not      especially valuable. The husks and inner bark contain a      very effective dyestuff, and Confederate soldiers were      sometimes called "butternuts" because their homespun      uniforms were colored brown with the help of this tree.    </p>    <p>      Pale-green, half-grown butternuts can be scalded, rubbed      smooth and soaked in strong brine (change the liquid every      day) for a week. Then drain the nuts, dry them and pierce      'em with a large needle. Pack the nuts with dill and      pickling spice or a sprinkling of nutmeg, ginger and cloves      and fill the containers with boiling cider vinegar. Seal      and wait a month... for what some oldtimers call "the best      pickle ever".    </p>    <h3>      hickory    </h3>        <p>      Hickories are relations of the walnuts. They're large,      well-shaped trees, 60-80 feet high, and thrive best in open      woods or at the edges of forests where they have plenty of      light. Most of the several species (other than the pecan)      are found all over the eastern half of the United States      from lower N ew England to the South.    </p>    <p>      Some folks say that harness racing could never have been      developed without the tough, elastic hickory wood that goes      into the sulkies. Hickory is also celebrated as the best      raw material for skis, axe handles, chair backs, barrel      hoops and other wooden items that have to do hard work.      Every outdoor cook knows its value as a fuel . . . and who      hasn't heard of hickory-smoked hams?    </p>    <p>      The shellbark hickory (its bark comes loose in long strips)      is the most popular Â° for its nuts. The fruit from any      hickory, however is wholesome to eat if the flavor is good.    </p>    <h3>      chestnut    </h3>        <p>      The chestnut is included on this poster as a tribute to its      former importance . . . and in the hope that it may someday      be re-established in a disease-resistant form.    </p>    <p>      The native American chestnut was highly valued by the early      settlers. Its wood was used for furniture, fencing and      musical instruments, the bark produced tannin and the big,      nutritious nuts were an important food (even a money crop,      since they were harvested in large amounts for the city      markets). Then, about 1900, a fungus disease reached this      country from eastern Asia. The Asian chestnut, which had      been exposed to the blight over many centuries, was more or      less immune . . . but the American trees sickened rapidly      and in one human generation we lost a dominant forest      species.    </p>    <p>      A few old chestnut stumps survive, and sometimes still send      up sprouts which may reach a height of 20 or more feet      before succumbing to the blight.    </p>    <h3>      pecan    </h3>        <p>      Unlike other hickories, the pecan originally had a very      limited range: from southern Indiana, Iowa and Kansas south      to Alabama and Texas. The: commercial importance of the      nuts, however, has led to the planting of orchards in many      parts of the South. This impressive tree-80 to 100      feet high-has been used as an ornamental as far,      north as Massachusetts . . . but its real home is in warm,      rich bottom land.    </p>    <p>      Pecan wood is rather brittle and less useful than that of      the other hickories. When it comes to delicious eating,      though, many people feel that the fruit: of the pecan is      the aristocrat of the, group. The long, pointed      nuts-as you, already know if you're lucky enough to      live near a wild tree-are enclosed in thin husks      divided into quarters by lengthwise ridges. The shells of      the wild pecan are usually thicker than those of cultivated      varieties . . . but that's not go ing to stop anyone who's      ever tatted tasted the kernels    </p>
