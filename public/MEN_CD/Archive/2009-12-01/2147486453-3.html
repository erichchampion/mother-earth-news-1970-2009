        During the U.S. Civil War, the Christmas tree was widely treated as a symbol of hope for the reunification of the country. Christmas trees became symbols of patriotism, and were often decorated with flags, liberty bells and cookies. The trees displayed in the Jackson Sitting Room feature handmade peace dove cookies carrying flags of the nations of the world, as a holiday symbol of all nations’ desire for peace and harmony.
