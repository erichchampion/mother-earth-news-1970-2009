        <p>My father gave me his used treadmill before he died. I had been reading that the motor could be used in a DIY wind generator project. After taking the motor out, I planned to junk the frame and other components, but I discovered there was more to be made from the parts than just a wind generator!</p><ol><li>The motor is for the wind generator.</li><li>The two steel rods for the tread are my basis for a new telescope mount.</li><li>The handrails will have steps added to them to make a small ladder down to the water by my cabin.</li><li>The belt can be used on the ladder steps and elsewhere.</li><li>The heavy steel frame will be used to make a new sled to haul large and heavy items with my QuadRunner ATV. Iâ€™ll just turn it over and add rails.</li><li>The wooden floor will become the sled floor.</li><li>The heart monitor still works and will be used as such.</li><li>The pillar support will help support the generator.</li><li>The leftover motor-control parts, etc., will be handy for future projects.</li><li>There are some really good stainless steel nuts, bolts and screws.</li><li>All of the remaining plastic will be recycled.</li></ol><p>The best part: It was totally free.</p><h5>Donald Franck<br />Plainview, Minnesota</h5>
