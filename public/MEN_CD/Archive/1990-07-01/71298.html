                <p>      <strong>CLOTHES THAT WORK</strong>    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by Jan Adkins    </h5>    <p>      <em>American History 501</em>    </p>        <p>      <em>Samoans have lavalavas. Greeks have pom-poms on their      shoes. Japanese have kimonos. Austrians have those Chico      Marx hats but with deer fir pins. Out of our melting pot      and our push</em> west came the clothes that are a part of      the American image.    </p>    <p>      If you could take the hand of an angel and fly back to your      own best day, it is doubtful that you would be wearing a      three-piece suit. No, I don't mean your wedding day, but      the day you felt yourself most comfortable and full of      purpose. Chances are, you would have been wearing a pair of      jeans. Blue jeans, Levi's, dungarees, denims: cotton work      trousers of heavy blue drill that gain comfort and      character with age.    </p>    <p>      Downstairs, I have a drawerful of old jeans that I can't      bear to throw out. Jeans live with you so intimately that      they take on a life of their own. Haven't you ever reached      for a pair of gabardines with the intention of attending a      meeting, when a pair of jeans, hanging in the closet with a      ranger belt already looped through, stopped you:      <em>Whoa,pilgrim.Look out that window. That's some day,      right? Hang those clerking pants back up and let's get out      of here.</em>    </p>        <p>      In 1853, a Bavarian immigrant named Levi Strauss, an astute      merchant in San Francisco, responded to the gold-rush need      for tough miner's clothes. He had his stock of brown cotton      tent canvas run up as plain trousers, no belt loops and no      back pockets. A cinch belt in the back kept them up.      Scrabbling among too many rocks and too little gold,      crawling along shafts, wrestling timber supports and balky      dray mules, Strauss's "overalls" lasted. They were cheap      and they felt good.    </p>    <p>      Strauss switched to denim ( <em>from serge de Nimes</em> ,      a twill made in southern France) and had it dyed in      reliable, uniform indigo. By the I860s, Levi Strauss's blue      pants were daily wear for miners and farmers and cattlemen      throughout the West. In 1873 he bought, for $69 - the      price of the patent application - an idea from a      Russian immigrant tailor in Reno for making miner's pants      stronger by riveting the critical seams. They were      nicknamed jeans after the city of Genoa, where sailors wore      blue cotton canvas.    </p>           <p>      By 1880 the Levi was full-blown, with orange stitching      (including the trademark "arcuate" design across the back      pockets, once the functional anchor for pocket lining), bar      tacking, rivets, watch pocket and the "Two Horse" leather      patch. Lot numbers are assigned to products and, for the      OI-weight denim used, the "waist-high overalls" are called      501s. It's true; more so than most of the thin ghosts we      call up for our heritage, Levi's are rooted in the real      stuff.    </p>    <p>      Henry David Lee was another kind of merchant. He started      out in Ohio selling kerosene and moved west to Salina,      Kansas, with a small bundle of venture capital. The H.D.      Lee Mercantile Company sold fancy canned goods and offered      a line of Eastern work clothes. When shortages and shipping      didn't suit Henry David, he set up his own garment works,      producing overalls, jackets and dungarees. Dungarees refer      specifically to cotton drill pants without bib fronts, and      generally to the rough blue cotton cloth named for the      dyer's section of Bombay- <em>Dungri</em>      -where it originated. Lee's chauffeur probably came      up with the Lee Union-All, a denim coverall that became the      uniform of mechanics and other workers in grimy      environments. Later, it evolved into the flight suit.    </p>    <p>      In the 1920s, about the time Lee was introducing the first      zipper fly, Levi Strauss was deleting the crotch rivet.      Chafed horsemen had pressed the company for years to remove      it, but it took a fly-fishing trip by the chairman of the      board to do so. As he crouched near a campfire listening to      a story, that central copper rivet heated up nicely. The      chairman bolted upright-and the rivet went. Later,      with the universal acceptance of jeans, the back-pocket      rivets that scratched school desks, dining room chairs,      saddles and car fenders became extinct.    </p>    <p>      Jeans do more than cover your body. They hold you. They      support and comfort, they remind you that you are girded      for the struggle. Putting on jeans makes a rough morning      easier.    </p>    <p>      They take your measure and keep your faith. Jeans mold to      you and become yours alone. If you eat too much, they tell      you, <em>Hey, back away from the trough, Hoss, you're      straining the measure.</em> Their blue color, in all its      variations, suits any kind of day. They look fine over      Bally loafers or Chippewa workboots, under a Redskins      sweatshirt or a Harris Tweed jacket. They are easy,      unstrained, unpretentious. They are egalitarian; it is a      severe test of Thomas Jefferson and not of jeans that I      cannot picture that gentleman farmer in a pair of Levi's.    </p>    <p>      Between Lee Riders and Levi's you must make your own      choice. (Land's End, L.L. Bean and others are a mail-order      alternative.) All are sturdy and authentic. Lee claims a      better-designed crotch. Good. Levi's are undoubtedly the      original. Good. Lee pays great attention to women's fit and      makes six grades of embrace from baggy to epidermal. Good.      I would no more suggest a preference in this matter than I      would suggest whether you wear boxers or briefs.    </p>    <p>      There is a down side to jeans. All that holding and      comforting can, like an over-attentive spouse, get in your      way. The very cling that you can lean against takes effort      to overcome. Jeans are not the best climbing gear.      Straining your knee up to and past your belt, sometimes      necessary in scaling a peak like the Devil's Needle, wears      on you after a few hours of moving vertically. In addition,      jeans can be hot, so they may not be the prime choice for      heavy work in the sun.    </p>    <p>      We go back to our heritage. Who works hard in the sun? The      fanner. What does he wear? Bib overalls.    </p>    <p>      Americans find it easy to adopt cowboy jeans as their own      but it takes a big man to wear bib overalls. I happen to be      wearing a pair now. There is much to recommend in these      Oshkosh B'gosh bib-front blues. The bib is probably a      vestige of protection for walking through fields of corn      leaves, or a response to the railroader's need to lean      against and over greasy machinery. Unlike jeans' gun-belt      tightness around the center of gravity, bibs and their      suspenders have a looser, more general embrace. Like the      Bedouin burnoose, it promotes circulation. Bibs are      designed around a walking, stooping, reaching man, rather      than around a riding man.    </p>    <p>      When wearing jeans, you can carry some folding money ("Keep      the change, I'm wearing jeans."), a bandanna, a stockman's      knife that wears through the pocket in about 10 minutes, a      pocket watch that can withstand several atmospheres of      compression, and a note from the foreman. A wallet in the      hip pocket looks like a misplaced pacemaker and galls the      buttocks. Now, in these bib overalls, I've got room for a      socket set and a desk encyclopedia. I've got pockets down      there for folding carpenter's rules, loops here for      hammers, buttonholes up here for my railroad watch fob      (engineers and brakemen <em>always</em> wore bib overalls),      pockets toward the rear for bandanna and notebook. These      things feel good, too.    </p>    <p>      The only down side is that I catch myself in a passing      mirror a few times a day and do a classic double take. At      first glance, I look like a cartoon. At second glance, I      look like a refugee farmer. But careful examination reveals      a confident man concerned with his own comfort and cargo      capacity, a man who is no slave to fashion. It takes a big      man to wear bib overalls.    </p>    <p>      Oshkosh B'gosh turns out bibs for men, women and tiny      children in several colors and in their "hickorystriped"      railroad blue and white. They also make "painter's pants":      work pants with a free and easy cut. The Oshkosh product is      strong and durable. There are plenty of stories from the      manufacturer about inhabitants of bib overalls who fell      from trains, horsedrawn harrows and quarry lifts only to be      saved by the strength of their Oshkosh B'gosh garments. No      stories exist about all the switchmen and combine operators      who were standing about musing on whatever when a passing      freight or harvesting arm grabbed them by the bibs and took      them away into that eternal silence. I'm not sure I would      operate the kind of machinery that warns against "loose      clothing" while wearing bib overalls.    </p>    <p>      The clothing industry is braced for the wave - soon,      this reporter is informed - of bib overall fashion.      NATO has been braced against a similarly foretold wave for      40 years. I like bibs; they are comfy and commodious and      they make a jingling noise with their metal fittings when I      walk. I do not think, though, that the image of the      farmer-as honorable and essential as he is-will      supplant the headier concept of the cowboy as the      quintessential American male. Even in deep farm country,      where pig sties and indignant skunks perfume the night air      over plowed fields, the plowman changes out of his bib      overalls and into his 501s, his cowboy boots and his      go-to-meeting high-roller hat before he heads for Sally's      Crossroads Tavern. We can all use a little heritage on a      good night.    </p>
