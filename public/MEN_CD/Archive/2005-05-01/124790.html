        If your image of a dog sled team conjures up pictures of Alaska's1,100-mile Iditarod race, think again. Dog teams can be fitted forall kinds of jobs.<br /><br />My family lives in Warren, N.H., on the edge of White MountainNational Forest. We have a four-dog team that hauls us throughmiles of northern landscape in every season.<br /><br />When it's time to work, we can hook our team to a cargo sled ortoboggan and use them to haul freight. A four-dog team can pull a200-pound person 10 miles at an average speed of 15 mph, so theyhave no problem pulling a bundle or two of kindling, or severalbuckets of newly tapped maple syrup. They also can follow asnowmobile trail just about anywhere, and there's nothing quitelike visiting a neighbor's house on a sled.<br /><br />Dog sledding may not be for everyone, but on a small scale it isfar less complicated than you may imagine. We use four Alaskan sleddogs ? Muppin, Charlie, Willow and Laika ? but most draft dogs willdo as well. (Try Siberians or Malamutes if you intend to pullgreater weights, because they tend to be larger.)<br /><br />Nearly every northern state boasts a sled dog club. Watch theclassifieds. Check <a href="http://www.sleddogcentral.com" target="_blank">Sled DogCentral</a> or <a href="http://nooksackracing.com" target="_blank">Noonsack RacingSupply</a>. Unless you are considering running the dogs in races,you needn't acquire first-string dogs.<br /><br />Wouldn't a snowmobile be easier? Sure. But when our son stands onthe runners of the sled, ready to guide the team over a six-miletrail, I inevitably feel pride. The dogs are part of our day, soingrained in the fabric of our hours that we could not imagine lifewithout them. They are as distinct in our minds as we are to eachother.
