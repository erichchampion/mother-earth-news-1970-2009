                    <h5 id="byline">      ERNEST J. KARHU    </h5>        <p>      PHOTOS BY AUTHOR. LINE DRAWINGS,<br />      EXCEPT FOR WILD GRAPE AND QUEEN ANNE'S-LACE,<br />      COURTESY OF BRITISH COLUMBIA PROVINCIAL MUSEUM.<br />      <br />    </p>    <p>      I learned at an early age that our home in the country was      surrounded by groceries "free for the picking". Wild      strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, dewberries,      elderberries and wild grapes contributed to my summer fare.      The aroma of fresh berry pie and canned wild fruits remains      quite vivid in my memory of those days. I especially recall      the nearby field of wild asparagus so abundant that most of      the spears grew into seed stalks before they could be cut.    </p>    <p>      Still, although I've stalked the wild asparagus since age      four, I've just begun to really appreciate the value of      foraged food. Over the years, except for an occasional trip      into the country to hunt walnuts, I'd almost forgotten      about the wild foods of my childhood. A recent job      transfer, however, enabled me to purchase a home near an      abandoned vineyard overgrown with several varities of wild      berries. Furthermore, our new house is within a few miles      of THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>. This fortunate coincidence has      opened a new experience of foraging wild foods for my      entire family.    </p>    <p>      Most folks view wild vegetation with contempt and as an      enemy of the lawn and garden. That which is not a planned      part of the suburban development is viewed as being      worthless; as an eyesore which detracts from a      well-manicured environment. A wide variety of dangerous      chemicals has been developed to eliminate such "worthless      weeds". Unfortunately, I've seen many a fine wild      strawberry patch succumb to chemicals and the lawn mower.      Countless vacant lots, once lushly overgrown with a live      supply of wild foods, have been transformed into wastelands      of barren stubble.    </p>    <p>      I'd like to suggest with this article that our so-called      "weeds" may serve some fundamental purpose - not only to a      balanced ecology - but also to human nutrition.      Additionally, although the experience of foraging for wild      food may not be a panacea for our times, it may yield some      positive alternatives to our present system of control.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WILD STRAWBERRIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Few people will dispute the fact that wild strawberries are      superior to cultivated varieties. They're a valued prize      for the wild food forager. I've located a number of fine      patches of this luscious fruit within a few hundred yards      of my suburban home. One patch is nearly an acre in size      and its berries are exceptionally good.    </p>    <p>      Although the wild strawberry is small and filling a pail      with clean berries is a painstaking task, my family and I      usually have been able to pick enough for several dessert      treats in a half hour. Our children enjoy harvesting wild      fruit and always look forward to an excursion to the      strawberry patch. Sometimes our two-year-old Betsy picks      more than six-year-old John. Betsy, however, is usually      unwilling to share her treasure and prefers to have it      served with milk as soon as she returns home.    </p>            <p>      Not many folks realize that wild strawberry leaves are one      of the richest natural sources of vitamin C. The leaves can      be eaten raw, in a salad, or as a garnish for camp stew.      Since their taste and texture may not be totally pleasing      to everyone's palate, a mild-tasting extract can be made by      placing the leaves in a blender with a little water. This      mixture can then be used to dilute frozen juice      concentrates. It can also be boiled and served with a      little honey as a nutritious tea.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BLACKBERRIES</strong><br />    </p>    <p>      The blackberry and related dewberry grow in abundance      throughout nearly all the United States. Blackberries are      probably the most valued and used wild fruit in the      country. A hedge of them, mixed with wild grape vines,      grows at the rear of our lot. More blackberries surround      the nearby strawberry patches, grow wild in the vineyard,      along fence rows and in the edge of the closest woods. When      the strawberry crop is gone, our children eagerly await      blackberry picking time.    </p>    <p>      In the past two summers, we've made use of this wild crop      in pies, cobblers, jams, jellies, juices and wines. We've      added blackberries to other foods and canned them. For some      reason, we've never tired of this abundant crop and we      never seem to have enough of the highly nutritious fruit.    </p>    <p>      Blackberries contain a good amount of protein, calcium,      phosphorus, iron and vitamins A and C. Their overall      nutritional value is higher than orchard fruits.    </p>    <p>      As a child, I looked forward to blackberry picking each      summer. In the late afternoon of a picking day, I carried      my harvest to the nearby highway and set up a little stand.      Within an hour, all my berries would be sold. Sometimes      sales were so fast that I had to disappoint my regular      customers.    </p>            <p>      <strong>VIOLETS</strong>    </p>    <p>      On our first family forage for wild foods, we were      introduced to eating blue violets. At first, the thought of      eating flowers seemed rather strange, but after a few tries      it became quite natural.    </p>    <p>      Both the flowers and the leaves of the common blue violet      are edible. A half-cup of violet greens provides more than      the daily adult requirement of vitamins A and C. Although      the taste of the greens is rather bland, they're not at all      bad and the experience of eating wild violets was an      enjoyable one for our two children. My wife and I, however,      experienced some momentary anxiety when we thought that      Betsy had eaten some of the poison ivy growing alongside a      cluster of violets (although we know some people who claim      that eating poison ivy produces an immunity - and I've seen      it done - we do not recommend this practice). Fortunately,      our little daughter had learned to identify the wild foods      we've eaten and, apparently, has not experimented on her      own.    </p>    <p>      Our new interest in blue violets encouraged us to attempt      transplanting some from the nearby woods to our flower      garden. The operation was successful and we should have an      abundant crop next year. One of the best things about the      violet, by the way, is that it's not harmed by picking the      blossoms. The more you pick, the more the plant produces.    </p>            <p>      For those who enjoy experimenting with alternative methods      of preparing wild foods, the violet - in addition to the      standard wild salad - can be used to make jam, jelly, syrup      and confections. When one considers the numerous alleged      conditions cured by violet syrup (according to the old time      herbalists), who knows what may be discovered!    </p>    <p>      <strong>DANDELION</strong>    </p>    <p>      The dandelion is a favorite of many people throughout the      world and is one of the easiest plants to identify: Just      ask anyone with a lawn.    </p>    <p>      I prefer to pick dandelions as soon as they begin to grow,      when the leaves are young and tender. Others wait until the      plants are more substantial but still pick the leaves      before blossoms develop. The mature dandelion leaves have a      strong, characteristically bitter taste that can be reduced      by boiling the plant in lightly salted water for about five      minutes.    </p>    <p>      The dandelion bud has been found to contain a fair amount      of vitamins A and C and a rather high quantity of protein.      Dandelions should be considered an essential part of any      survival diet because of the plant's nutritional value, its      abundance and variety of uses. Even the roots - diced and      roasted for about four hours - make a good coffee      substitute.    </p>    <p>      Dandelion blossoms, of course, are famous for their use in      making wine.    </p>    <p>      I prefer to pick dandelions as soon as they begin to grow,      when the leaves are young and tender. Others wait until the      plants are more substantial but still pick the leaves      before blossoms develop.    </p>    <p>      The mature dandelion leaves have a strong,      characteristically bitter taste that can be reduced by      boiling the plant in lightly salted water for about five      minutes. After the plant blooms it is usually considered      too bitter to eat. I think the younger leaves are a fine      addition to a salad; the more mature greens can be eaten      cooked like spinach and seasoned with butter.    </p>    <p>      The developing yellow blossoms, which form as crowns,      provide another vegetable for the table. Cover them with      boiling water and cook for about three minutes. Drain and      season with salt and butter. The crowns are edible until      they mature into blossoms, although - as they approach this      change - they must be cooked longer and the water changed      once before eating.    </p>    <p>      Euell Gibbons reminds us that the botanical name for the      dandelion, <em>Taraxacum officinale</em> , suggests that it      is the "official remedy for disorders". An ancient name for      dandelion was "scurvey plant", derived from its use in      curing or preventing that disease.    </p>    <p>      The dandelion bud has been found to contain a fair amount      of vitamins A and C and a rather high quantity of protein.      Dandelions should be considered an essential part of any      survival diet because of the plant's nutritional value, its      abundance and variety of uses. Even the roots - diced and      roasted for about four hours - make a good coffee      subsitute. Dandelion blossoms, of course, are famous for      their use in making wine.    </p>            <p>      <strong>WILD CARROT</strong>    </p>    <p>      While clearing some "unwanted weeds" from my garden this      spring, I discovered that most of the plants were wild      carrot (Queen Anne's-lace). Many had sizeable roots and,      within a short time, I gathered a full pail. The plant is      easily identified by its delicate feathery leaves, tall      slender stalks topped by white flowering umbels - some of      which are flattened like saucers - and a characteristic      carrot odor. The edible roots are white, rather than      yellow-orange.<br />    </p>    <p>      Wild carrots should be washed, scraped and boiled for about      twenty minutes. Before serving, season with butter and      salt. The tough pulpy cores can be removed quite easily      before eating. Wild carrots can also be used to flavor camp      stew or soup.    </p>    <p>      It is said that the best part of the plant is the seeds.      They can be used to make tea (mixed with a little spearmint      or peppermint), as a spice for cooking and as an herbal      medicine (for flatulence, coughs and hiccups).    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANTAIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      The lowly lawn and garden pest known as plantain ranks near      the top of the list of nutritional greens. Plantain is said      to outrank garden greens in nutrients because it grows more      slowly and, thus, has more time to store vitamins and      minerals. The early pioneers used plantain extensively in      their diets and the plant is still an important food in      certain sections of the U.S.<br />    </p>    <p>      Plantain is available almost everywhere and its appearance      is readily discernible: Ribbed, long, broad oval leaves and      slender seed stalks growing out of the center of the leaf      cluster.    </p>    <p>      Its bland taste makes plantain a palatable addition to any      salad. I much prefer it to dandelion greens. It isn't as      tender as head lettuce but plantain can be chopped and made      tender enough to suit any taste. As a general rule the      young, smaller, rather shiny broad-oval leaves are best.      These small plantain leaves are available all summer      because new leaves continue to form throughout the season.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLOVER</strong>    </p>    <p>      The reddish-purple blossom heads of the ordinary wild      clover are rated high on the list of survival foods. They      are a tasty addition to any salad and they can be eaten      alone. The heads can be gathered throughout June and July      and dried indoors at room temperature for later use as tea.      A small amount of dried spearmint and peppermint leaves      added to the clover is said to make a healthful brew. The      blossoms should be gathered from undisturbed fields rather      than from the lawn. The large blossoms from the fields are      distinctly tastier than the small yard-variety clover      blooms. I find myself nibbling clover blossoms every time I      take a hike.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MAY APPLE</strong>    </p>    <p>      After the first few warm days of spring, our closest woods      seems to be filled with umbrella-like plants growing in      dense clusters. Each of these May apple plants, with a stem      that forks into two of the characteristic umbrellas, will      develop a waxy-white blossom at the "V" of the stem. The      blossom is soon followed by a single, smooth, yellow fruit      about the size and shape of an egg. When the May apples are      ripe, in late summer, they may be picked and eaten.<br />    </p>    <p>      The taste of the musky May apple is difficult to describe:      It has been likened to the guava and the passion fruit.      Those who may not appreciate the flavor can liquify May      apples in a blender and add the juice to lemonade or mix it      half and half with a table wine. The wild food gourmet      should also consider making May apple Marmalade. It's      reputed to be the finest product of this fruit.    </p>    <div class="sidebar">      <h3>        MAMA KARHU'S RECIPES      </h3><strong>BLACKBERRY JAM<br />      STRAWBERRY JAM</strong><br />      <br />      4 cups prepared fruit<br />      7 cups sugar<br />      1/2 bottle Certo Fruit Pectin      <p>        Wash about 2 quarts fully ripe fruit. Crush completely,        one layer at a time. (If desired, sieve half the pulp to        remove some of the seeds.) Measure 4 cups into a very        large pan.      </p>      <p>        Scald about 10 medium sized jelly glasses in soapy water.        Rinse, scald again, then drain. Keep the jars warm by        placing on a cookie sheet in a warm oven.      </p>      <p>        To the fruit in the pan, add exactly the amount of sugar        stated in recipe. Mix well.      </p>      <p>        Place over high heat, bring to a full rolling boil, and        boil hard 1 minute, stirring constantly. Remove from        heat; at once stir in Certo. Skim off foam with metal        spoon. Then stir and skim for 5 minutes to cool and to        prevent floating fruit.      </p>      <p>        Pour jam into half of the glasses. Place lid on one jar        at a time, screw on band tightly, invert jar. Fill the        remaining jars in the same manner. When finished, turn        jars upright. Jars should seal within a few minutes. If        they don't, press down with the thumb on the center of        the lid until you hear it buckle. Don't worry if they        take about 15 or 20 minutes to seal. Keep working with        them. The jam won't spoil that quickly.<br />        <br />        <strong>GRAPE JAM</strong><br />        <br />        5 cups prepared fruit<br />        7 1/2 cups sugar<br />        1/2 bottle Certo Fruit Pectin      </p>      <p>        Follow the instructions for the above recipe. Makes about        12 medium jelly glasses.<br />        <br />        <strong>HOMEMADE SHORTCAKE</strong><br />        <br />        3 cups flour<br />        1/2 teaspoon salt<br />        4 teaspoons baking powder<br />        1/4 cup sugar<br />        1/2 cup shortening<br />        1 1/4 cups milk<br />        1 egg, beaten      </p>      <p>        Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder. Cut in        shortening until it is well blended with the flour. Add        beaten egg to the milk; then add all at once to the        flour. Mix lightly until flour is thoroughly moistened,        then pat into 10x15 baking pan and sprinkle with the        sugar. Bake 12-15 minutes at 400°. Serve in soup        plates, surrounded with plenty of crushed, sweetened        berries. Top with cream.      </p>      <p>        I make cream by chilling a can of evaporated milk in the        freezer until it is the consistency of soft sherbet. Then        very quickly beat the milk and add vanilla extract and        sugar to suit your own taste. The leftover cream does not        keep.      </p>    </div>    <p>      <strong>SORREL</strong><br />      <br />      Another tasty green that grows abundantly in our nearby      fields is sorrel. The spearhead-shaped leaf, one-half to      two inches in length, grows in clumps and sometimes      virtually covers the ground in overgrown and unused      pastures. Of all the wild greens I've eaten, I prefer      sorrel. It's very tender and has a slightly sour taste that      some describe as lemony (which suggests using the blender      to make sorrelade).    </p>    <p>      There is an old axiom that "the better the taste, the      higher the nutritive value". I've found this true when      comparing wild foods and, although I haven't seen an      analysis of sorrel, I believe the plant has sufficient      value to justify my preference for this salad green.    </p>    <p>      There are more than enough vitamins and minerals in wild      foods to sustain health. Indeed, many uncultivated plants      contain more food value than the best garden vegetables and      fruits. Freshness is one rather obvious reason why wild      foods outscore grocery store produce but, beyond that,      analysis has shown many wild plants to be vastly superior      to the garden variety.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, our palates have become accustomed to      certain foods for reasons other than nutrition. Few people      will ever become ecstatic over a strict diet of wild foods      but, thanks to my recent relatively short but intense      exposure to foraging, I am no longer impressed by shelves      of processed garbage in the supermarket. I am sure that we      could, with benefit to our health and well-being, forget      the grocery store altogether, in preference to that which      grows wild in the fields.    </p>    <p>      I'm amazed at how eagerly our children have responded to      our foraging experiments. They have been quite willing to      try every new wild food we've selected and they have not      rejected any of these unfamiliar taste sensations. They've      also come to know our Mother Earth to be a provider of      abundant resources which may suggest to them that some of      the finest things of life are still free.    </p>    <p>      Although this article does not exhaust my own experience      with wild eats, my knowledge is vastly limited compared to      what I have yet to learn. Some of the more experienced      foragers could find hundreds of valuable crops in the      territory I've walked. A few even suggest that practically      every plant can be eaten and contains some food value.    </p>    <p>      As a general rule, for those who attempt survival living,      any plant that tastes good is edible. If you want to      experiment, then, don't swallow anything that is      particularly bitter. And, when you do swallow, always first      try just a tiny bite of the new plant. If you don't      experience any nausea or upset within eight to ten hours,      chances are that your potential food source is edible.    </p>    <p>      I would further recommend that the neophyte forager carry      the field guide edition of Euell Gibbons' <em>Stalking the      Wild Asparagus.</em> It is also well to be accompanied by      an experienced guide but almost anyone can easily identify      the foods recommended in this article and those suggested      by James Churchill in the last issue of THE MOTHER EARTH      NEWS.    </p>
