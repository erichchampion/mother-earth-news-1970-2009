                <p>      . . . but whattaya do when the gang doesn't all show up to      get their orders? Stephen Salaff laid down one idea<br />      in a recent piece for the San Francisco GOOD TIMES    </p>    <h5 id="byline">by STEPHEN SALAFF</h5>        <p>      <strong>GOOD TIMES</strong> , $6.00/YEAR<br />      2377 Bush Street San Francisco, California 94115    </p>    <p>      One Saturday afternoon in March, I met a bunch of people      standing around a parked station wagon. It seems that the      wagon had returned to Berkeley from early morning shopping      at the San Francisco Farmer's Market with a load of      vegetables. The people were part of the Food Conspiracy,      which provides food to neighborhood groups at wholesale      prices. One of them said that some co-conspirators had      failed to collect their food at the assigned hour, and so      it was decided to give away all the extras right out of the      station wagon. This illustrates one of the problems of such      a food distribution system - the members have to get to the      distribution point on time.    </p>    <p>      I helped myself to the assorted vegetables, picking three      medium-sized onions, eggplants, tomatoes, zucchini, and      green peppers - fifteen in all. The dish I cooked with them      is a vegetable stew from the French Provence region, called      a ratatouille. It is, in one or another variant, a natural      and colorful way to utilize a windfall of fresh vegetables.    </p>    <p>      To make a ratatouille for six to eight persons, you will      need, in addition to the above vegetables, two cloves of      chopped garlic, at least one-half cup of olive oil, and one      or more "tomato" spices, like basil and chopped parsley.      Here's what you do with each vegetable:    </p>    <p>      Onions: slice thinly<br />      Green Peppers: halve, remove core and seeds, and slice into      thin strips (julienne slices)<br />      Eggplant: cut into one quarter inch rounds, and then into      one inch squares; no need to peel<br />      Zucchini: peel and slice into half-inch pieces<br />      Tomatoes: quarter    </p>    <p>      Heat one-half cup of olive oil in a wide, heavy pan. Saute      the onions and chopped garlic until the onions are soft but      not brown, and then add the green peppers, eggplants, and      zucchini. Pour a little more olive oil over the top, cover,      and cook gently for 40 minutes. (Feel free to vary the      proportions of the vegetables used, according to what you      have on hand. Bear in mind that eggplants soak up a lot of      olive oil; if you have fewer eggplants you may cut down on      the oil). Add the quartered tomatoes and your spices. Cook      20 minutes more, or until the vegetables are quite soft but      not mushy. The texture should be that of a thick, coarse      puree. Uncover and continue to heat 5-10 minutes to reduce      the amount of liquid remaining in the pan.    </p>    <p>      In a good ratatouille, each of the vegetables is      distinguishable by sight and taste, so proceed gently      without overcooking. This dish can be served hot or cold,      and if you add a little more oil, it takes kindly to      reheating.    </p>
