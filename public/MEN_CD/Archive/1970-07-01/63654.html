                    <p>      CYNTHIA ANDERSON<br />      Originally published in the February 25, 1970<br />      EUGENE REGISTER-GUARD.    </p>        <p>      "Dan's wife" makes the bagels; Mrs. Neusihin makes the      pickles. Granola - "a cereal that really stays crisp" - is      60  cents a pound packaged; if you bring your own container      it's 55  cents and you can buy as much or as little as you      need.    </p>    <p>      Willamette People's Cooperative, the corner grocery store      which sells these items, is a booming business. Two months      old, the grocery at 22nd and Emerald has over 500 members      (at $5 a share) and is grossing $700 to $800 a day. Already      there is talk about starting another co-op to handle a      volume which surprises even the organizers.    </p>    <p>      The place was started by a group of University of Oregon      students and their friends who wanted to sell groceries at      lower prices and to sell an idea - that a sense of      community can be created through common cause and need.    </p>    <p>      Transportation problems have blighted that community spirit      somewhat but volunteer sales help (20 to 30 clerks who work      without pay) continues strong behind the counter.    </p>    <p>      The co-op buys a lot of its stock in Portland and from      farmers, slaughterhouses and wholesalers around the      country. People have given cars (some of which won't run)      to the store for pickup runs by volunteer drivers. But      occasionally you won't find the Tillamook cheddar which      sells at 81  cents a pound or fresh eggs for 66  cents a      dozen.    </p>    <p>      You usually can find a good supply of fresh mushrooms at 62       cents a pound; olives at 75  cents a pint; brown rice, soy      flour, wheat flour, and three varieties of beans - all sold      at bulk prices. Whole milk is 88  cents a gallon (used to be      83  cents but inflation hits co-ops, too).    </p>    <p>      After two months of successful operation, the co-op      membership has voted to shift the emphasis to more natural      and health foods. At a meeting last week members decided to      stop the sale of cigarettes because smoking is "a filthy,      addicting habit;" to stop the sale of "garbage" sweets and      stock healthful candies for the school kids; to limit      stocks of certain packaged foods which aren't particularly      healthful; and to emphasize the sale of fresh fruits and      vegetables over canned goods.    </p>    <p>      Jack Corbett who works afternoons at the co-op says rumors      that the store is being harassed by food licensing agencies      are untrue. He said the clerks who cut the cheese and meats      for customers have to have food handlers licenses and      Corbett agrees they should. He said he's found the food      inspectors helpful and it's simple to meet health      requirements if you're willing to listen to inspectors.    </p>    <p>      Willamette People's Cooperative gets crowded most      afternoons and insiders recommend you shop early or late.      Hours are 9 a.m. to 9 p.m. You can buy at the store even if      you're not a member but it isn't encouraged.    </p>    <p>      Shoppers include everyone from youngsters who pay 7 cent       cents to help themselves to one of Mrs. Neusihin's pickles      to old timers who like the atmosphere. Browsers read signs      explaining the benefits of natural grains and      poly-unsaturate oils, the average wage of Guatemalan farm      workers and the number of war victims in Vietnam. Buyers      help themselves to flour from wooden barrels and grind      their own coffee. The adventurous can even take home a      piece of horsemeat to try out on the family.    </p>
