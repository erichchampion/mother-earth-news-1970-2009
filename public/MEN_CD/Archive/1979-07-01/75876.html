        <h5>Issue # 58 - July/August 1979.</h5><p>THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Inc., P.O. Box 70, Hendersonville, N.C. 28739</p><p>In Issue No. 37, Bill Wodraska shared some of his thoughts regarding one of mankind's better ideas-barter-and offered up an interesting suggestion: "I'd like to see a continuing feature on barter and skill-and-labor exchanges," said Bill. "Maybe MOTHER could even swap subscriptions for contributions to the department." "You're on!" we replied . .. and announced our still standing offer: Anyone (and that means you!) who sends us a short (200 words or less) account of an actual barter that's good enough to print will receive-as the folks on the following pages have-a twelve-month subscription (or extension of same) to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted).</p><p>My kitchen walls had a bad case of the drearies, but I didn't have the money to pay for a wallpaper job . . . nor did I know how to do the work on my own. I had just about resigned myself to another year of bleak baking . . . when barter came to the rescue. It seems that a friend of mine-who is a professional paperhanger-had once admired my homemade afghan and wished she could make one for herself. So I called my chum and proposed a swap . . . which was accepted as soon as the words were oUt of my mouth! I bought the yarn - a total outlay of $13-and crocheted up a storm. . . while my friend purchased the paper and pasted it up. The end results were an artful afghan and a spanking new kitchen.</p><p>Some time later, the bathroom needed papering. I called my barter-mate again, and soon had a beautiful bath, while she earned two hand-worked shawls.</p><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">An added bonus evolved from our trading, too: While assisting my friend in her measuring and pasting, I learned enough about paperhanging to be able to tackle a second bathroom all by myself! And I couldn't begin to put a price on the pleasurable hours of company as the two of us worked together.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Karen Besecker<br />Arcanum, Ohio</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">My family and I have always made our large suburban yard work for us by filling it with fruits and vegetables. We've swapped rhubarb for fine Philippine dinners, sold grapes (and traded some for delicious plums), and processed lots of food for winter use. What we really hanker for, though, is a few acres on the Chesapeake Bay, suitable for farming and accessible to crabbing and fishing.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">The trouble is, acreage around Washington, D.C. is alarmingly high-priced, and-as a fulltime student and mother -I can't "work" regularly to earn the down payment necessary for our dream. We had begun to get kind of discouraged.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Then-after reading my second issue of MOTHER-the means became clear. I decided that if other folks could swap their services, so could I! You see, God gave me a wonderful gift: an excellent soprano voice (and a lot of guts!), so I decided to use my talent to earn the extra cash we needed.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">I posted signs advertising my skill ("soloist will add elegance to your wedding . . . willing to barter and trade") in the most unlikely places: farmers' markets, local tobacco barns, and country stores (as well as in the classified section of a local newspaper), and-surprisingly enough-I've been very busy!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Many people pay cash for my services . . . but lots of folks prefer to swap. So far we've been the recipients of bushels of corn, some bunnies, 10 pounds of fresh pork sausage, loaves of fresh bread, and beautiful flowers and plants. Best of all, though, I'm making lots of farm friends while I'm saving up the money for that "dreamstead" !</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Nancy Carol Brodey<br />Camp Springs, Md.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">While on holiday here in Columbus, Ohio I swapped a repair job on a player piano for the roof over my head! You see, in almost every step of my world travels I've been given names of folks I should "be sure to look up" for a night's accommodation. But-after many awkward telephone calls to people on my list-I finally hit on the idea of proposing a trade instead of asking for a handout . . . and my "brainstorm" really works!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Now when I phone prospective hosts or hostesses, I introduce myself and tell them (with gusto) that I'm handy with tools, can clean, repair electrical appliances, and so forth. And, after making this offer, I feel much more relaxed about asking for a place to stay the night in exchange. It's amazing how frequently people snap up the idea (especially if I suggest a few possibilities). They nearly always remember some long-shelved maintenance or odd job that needs doing . . . and are happy to barter a warm bed and a hot meal for the labor.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">My swapping method has been successful all over the world: I've mended a toaster in Switzerland, cleaned windows in Paris, moved a piano in Salzburg, done an oil change in Munich . . . each job in exchange for a night's shelter. So the next time you're on the road and looking for a place to stay, try my system! Believe me, you'll feel more comfortable as a contributing member of any household that takes you in.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Geoffrey Hopkins<br />Dulwich, Australia</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">With no original investment (other than a little of my time) I now have a first-class lawn mower, a three-speed bicycle, a neat little gasoline engine, a good set of tires, and $30 in cash!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">A friend-knowing my propensity for barter-asked me to do a bit of dealing for him: He wanted to swap a shotgun to a dealer for a telescopic sight, and he agreed that anything I got in excess of the scope was mine to keep. So I made the exchange . . . and got the dealer to throw in a used 22-caliber rifle besides.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">That's when my hoss-tradin' really started: I swapped the rifle for a wood planer, exchanged the planer for a 10" band saw, used the saw for a couple of years and then traded it to a friend for a 1972 Chevrolet Vega plus $30. I then swapped the Vega (after putting its new tires on my daughter's car) for an 8-HP riding mower with a brand-new engine, a good three-speed bicycle . . . and a horizontal shaft, kick-start gasoline engine which was just what I needed to run my leaf mulcher.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Barter has been an important part of my lifestyle for years and-at this rate - I really can't afford to stop!

Piper<br />Metropolis, III.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">About nine years ago our young family moved from suburban Chicago to the dairyland community of Bristol, Wisconsin. As "milk farmers" in this area retire, their tillable land is often bought up by younger folks, and these pasture purchases regularly leave behind five-and ten-acre "farmlets" with a full complement of buildings . . . usually including a large dairy barn. Our homestead is just such a leftover.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">When we stocked our farm with three Angus brood cows, our hope was that the critters would supply our family's beef needs . . . and possibly provide an extra steer or heifer to market. It didn't take us long to discover that our pasture grass would need to be supplemented with hay . . . feed that we would have to purchase.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">However, the farmer haying the land that had once been the greater part of our homestead found that he was somewhat short of storage space for his cash crop . . . and when that gentleman proposed the swap of 200 bundles of hay for the use of the upper level of our barn, we jumped at the offer. This trade has been such a perfect solution to our problems that it has continued for six or seven years . . . and, as a bonus, we get to keep all the broken bales, too!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Marilyn Kotz<br />Bristol, Wis.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">When we got our chance to relocate from southern California to the Colorado Rockies-we jumped at it! We very soon found that our opportunity had created a couple of problems, though: We needed to sell most of our furniture to purchase some good warm clothing.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">As the day of the move approached, we had not found a buyer for our sofa-which a MOTHER article had inspired us to reupholster-and without that money . . . we couldn't afford the clothing. Then a fellow worker told me that he was interested in the couch but didn't have the $200 we were asking for it. I mentioned that we would consider trading for some warm duds . . . and the next day my friend showed up with two down jackets, a down vest, a pair of furlined boots, some rain gear, and $100! Needless to say, we made the swap . . . and we moved to Colorado in toasty comfort.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Stephen Spradley<br />Dillon, Colo.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Barter has become an economic fact of life for my husband and me since we moved to our 65-acre subsistence farm just over four years ago.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">We have a sizable woodlot, so we've traded oak firewood for the following items: 4,000 feet of plastic pipe for our water system, a heat-distribution insert for the fireplace, our house insulation, and part of a doctor bill. A close friend -who is a welder and metal fabricator-has woodcutting privileges on our land in exchange for doing all our metalwork. And, currently, my husband is trading his labor at a local horse ranch-cleaning stalls-for all the manure we can use on our garden.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">But our true crowning achievement in swapping came when we pooled resources with a neighbor. In return for help with clearing his pastureland, our friend brought in a D-7 cat and built us a dam and a one-acre lake!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">We are now confirmed and enthusiastic barterers and are always looking for new ways to enrich our lives-and the lives of other folks, too-through this great system.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Barbara Coulson<br />Penn Valley, Calif.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Since I'm trained as a technician and experienced as a handyman, I find many opportunities to barter for things that I need. An elderly neighbor, for example, gives the the use of his tractor and tiller in exchange for their maintenance and repair. I recently rebuilt his tiller motor, and I'm really looking forward to using the machine in my garden this season.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">For the past few years, I've been doing electrical maintenance for another friend. In turn, he has given me access to every carpentry tool he owns. You name it, and he's got it: routers, band saw, vises, sanders, and closeting jig . . . it's a woodworker's paradise!</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Things wouldn't be complete without wood to use these tools on, though. Fortunately, I have a friend down the road who has a sawmill . . . and he occasionally needs my skills.

She wanted to give the bike to her young son for Christmas . . . but I knew that she couldn't afford anywhere near the true value of the vehicle. I suggested that we barter, and a couple of days later my neighbor came up with a swap offer that has changed my life . . . she wanted to trade an incubator and brooder for the two-wheeler.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">I promptly exchanged some surplus horse manure for a few hens and a rooster, and in no time I was broodin' a batch of peeps. In only a few months more, I was in the fresh egg business. Now -three years later-those cackleberries" are still putting bread on our table.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">I've bartered often since that first swap . . . a mule for two sheep, for instance, and some surplus chickens for a milking goat. But I still think my greatest tradin' benefit was the sight of two big smiles on Christmas morning: one on the face of a little boy with a new bike, and the other from his mother . . . who had been able to "afford" something she couldn't pay for.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Mrs. Grace Farley<br />Swedesboro, N.J.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Homesteading is hardly a form of slavery . . . but we did foresee years of roluntary servitude-in the form of mortgage payments-when we settled on our newly acquired 10 acres.

When a neighbor recently announced that he wanted to get rid of a :50-year-old log barn that was awkwardly located, I promptly offered my "tin can" as a swap. Bartering was the easy part of the job . . . as we discovered while removing the roof of the old building, numbering the logs, unsticking the walls, hauling the materials to their new home, building foundations, and reassembling the walls, floors, and roof. Of course, our four-wheel-drive truck-we'd swapped a beloved but now useless city car for the vehicle-made things easier. And once I installed our recently bartered-for doors and windows, we were marvelously snug in our recycled house.</a></p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article"></a><p><a class="bookmark" id="article" title="article" name="article">Here's the best part of the deal: We can now sell our mobile home, and-with the proceed-spay off the mortgage on the land.

At first, we swapped mostly our labor in the hayfields . . . for a nanny, a gentle old gelding, a barely used handcranked forge, and four tons of alfalfa. Then word circulated about Joe's woodworking skill . . . and we landed a feeder pig for minor carpentry and rabbits and ducks for some fencing.
