                    <p>      Back around 1931, Marcellus Jacobs (see the Plowboy      Interview in MOTHER NO. 24) designed a wind-driven      generator of electricity. It was good. So good that      now-over 40 year later-every commercially successful      windplant currently being manufactured anywhere in the      world is still more or less a Chinese copy of Jacobs' unit.    </p>    <p>      Over the decades, of course, many other inventors have      tried to improve or replace the Jacobs windplant with      modifications of the basic unit or completely new designs      of their own. Not a single one seems to have had much luck      in that endeavor so far but that hasn't discouraged a      steady stream of new experimenters from trying to beat      Marcellus at his own game year after year after year.    </p>    <p>      Now that a goodly percentage of the earth's human      population is finally beginning to realize the finite      nature of the planet's fossil fuel reserves, the search for      more efficient windplant designs has suddenly grown even      more intense and a sampling of the latest work in the field      is shown on the pages that follow.    </p>    <h3>A WINDPLANT DESIGN SERVICES</h3>    <p>      We have a service to offer anyone building a windplant:      complete design of the blades (with templates) plus      generator, transmission, and tower strength considerations.      Just provide the following information:    </p>    <p>      [1] Average power needed, in watts [2] Average wind at      site, in mph [3] Average temperature at site, in degrees F      [4] Altitude of site, in feet [5] Type of transmission    </p>    <p>      [a] direct drive [b] gear [c] timing belt [d] V belt    </p>    <p>      [6] Number of shafts in transmission [7] Generator      efficiency, if known (if not, just give nameplate data)    </p>    <p>      The cost of the full service is $5.00, and we'll also rent      you a wind velocity meter for $1.00 plus $5.00 returnable      deposit. Send a stamped, self-addressed envelope for a      sample solution or a free copy of our computer program.      Until July 1975, contact Bill Smith, 808 University Blvd.,      Apt. 2, Silver Spring, Md. 20903.    </p>    <h3>THE WIND POWER DIGEST</h3>    <p>      There's a lot going on in the field of wind power these      days and folks who are trying to keep abreast of current      civelopments might want to check out a new publication,      PVind Power Digest, edited by Mike Evans of Bristol,      Indiana. Mike describes the first issue now available as      "really an access catalog to wind power systems, designed      to convey as much general information as possible and      hopefully to mcourage a reader response cycle to keep the      magazine going." Whether or not that happens, Wind Power      Digest No.1 may turn out to be something of a collector's      item if it lives up to its table of contents:    </p>    <p>      [1] Photographs, drawings, and informational reviews of all      available electric-generating and water-pumping windmills,      including Aerowatt, Dunllte, Electro, Winco, Lubing,      Jacobs, Dempster, Baker, and Aermotor. Also listed are four      windplant designs now being researched for possible      marketing: American Wind Turbine, Zephyr Wind Dynamo,      Sailwing, and Helion 12/16.    </p>    <p>      [2] A Plans section including reviews of the Sencenbaugh 02      Powered Delight, Windworks, Sailwing, and 1 Footer,      Earthmind's S-Rotor, Brace Research S-Rotor, and a number      of other miscellaneous plans.    </p>    <p>      [3] A look at Jim Sencenbaugh's new windplant kit.    </p>    <p>      [4] Listings of various wind systems components, in cludine      batteries. inverters. miscellaneous. electronics, towers,      back-up generators, and windspeed measurement equipment.    </p>    <p>      [5] Listings of 18 companies which now market various wind      power systems and components.    </p>    <p>      [6] Reviews of the 14 most valuable publications currently      available in the wind power field.    </p>    <p>      [7] Reports on the groups researching wind power, including      a complete rundown on the activities of Brace Research      Institute during the past 14 years.    </p>    <p>      [8] Several features, including Bill Goddard's "An      Introduction to Helion", an interview with Environmental      Energies of Detroit, and an article by Winnie Red Rocker.    </p>    <p>      That's a lot -of useful material right there and Mike is      prepared to leave it at that if he must. He'd much prefer      to publish regularly, however, and is all set to do so if      No. 1 is well received. Which means, alternative energy      freaks, that the future of Wind Power Digest is up to you.      The first (last? only?) issue is available for $2.00      postpaid from Mike Evans, Rt. 2, Box 489, Bristol, Ind.      46507.    </p>
