                    <p>      "We've eliminated the weather vane tail, expensive      gearboxes and complicated feathering mechanisms needed by      most windplants," says Edmund I. Salter. "That makes our      unit simpler, quieter, and less expensive than other      wind-driven generators."    </p>    <p>      Mr. Salter-a mechanical engineer and President of San      Diego-based Wind Power Systems, Inc-.is talking about his      firm's new development, the RD-7000 Wind Turbine. And, as      his remarks indicate, the working prototype of the turbine      is radically different from most wind-driven generators of      the past and present.    </p>    <p>      The basic Salter unit (without tower) is 20 feet tall and      consists of a central alternator driven by three three      bladed propellers. The rotor blades are constructed of poly      urethane foam over alloy steel spar tubes and weigh less      than two pounds apiece. A circular steel rim around each      tri-fanned rotor, it is claimed, "Improves efficiency as      much as 20% by preventing air spillage at the blades' tips,      adds strength and rigidity to the propeller, and-by      pressing against a motorcycle wheel attached to the      alternator's drive shaft automatically spins the generator      five times as fast as the rotor turns."    </p>    <p>      The RD-7000 can produce 7,000 watts of 120-volt direct      current in a 25 to 28 mph wind and a maximum of 10,000      watts when driven by an air mass moving 32 mph. Salter      figures that one of the units, mounted on a tower at least      40 feet tall, will supply enough electricity to run a      single family home in any location with a minimum average      yearly wind velocity of eight miles per hour. Several of      the generating units can be grouped on one or more larger      towers to produce power for factories, subdivisions, and      small towns.    </p>    <p>      "The real secret of this design," says Salter, "is its      simplicity. The rotors run downwind of the machine's pivot      point. That eliminates the need for a tail vane and cuts      thirty to forty bucks off the cost of the windplant.    </p>    <p>      Our rim drive turns the generator 1,250 to 1,375 rpm in a      25 mph wind without costly gears. And the RD-7000's damping      device which is no more complicated than a door closer just      kind of lets the whole rig lay over further and further      whenever the speed of the wind increases to a more and more      dangerous level. This decreases the area of the rotors      exposed to the gale in a very straight forward and      inexpensive manner. It's ideas like these that should allow      us to install our wind turbine-less batteries-at a price of      about $450 per kilowatt."    </p>    <p>      Patents are pending on the RD-7000 and the prototype unit      is still being tested. Which is to say that the Salter      windplant probably won't be on the market for at least      another two years. But that doesn't stop it from being a      very interesting concept right now!.    </p>
