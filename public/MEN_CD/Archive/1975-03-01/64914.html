                    <h5 id="byline">      by Marj Watkins    </h5>    <p>      "After thirty," says the proverb, "you're either a fool or      your own physician." Maybe before thirty, too especially if      you live in an isolated spot and/or have a big, bump of      independence. Of course. you're a bigger fool still if you      meddle with a serious or persistent condition but both you      and your overworked doctor will be better off if you can      prevent or cure your own minor ills as Marj Watkins began      pointing out in MOTHER NO. 28. Here's another installment      of the health hints that work for her family.    </p>    <h3>      PREGNANCY PROBLEMS    </h3>    <p>      <strong>TO INHIBIT CONCEPTION:</strong> Raspberry leaf and      borage teas are recommended by tradition. Also, it's known      that primitive mothers-northern Eskimos, for example-who      breast feed babies for two or more years have a lower      fertility rate or are sterile during the nursing period.      Don't count on such protection for yourself, however,      unless you're an Eskimo or Hunzakit!. The most modern birth      control method the pill-is far more certain but does have      its drawbacks. In particular, it's reported to rob women's      bodies of vitamin B6, causing various minor symptoms:      halitosis, burning feet, vaginal irritation, headaches,      hair loss, insomnia, nervous disorders, visual      disturbances, and constipation. Some really serious      conditions are also connected with lack of B6: anemia,      diabetes, high blood cholesterol, cystic fibrosis,      pancreatitis, cataracts, and gallstones. Anyone who suffers      from such problems might do well to increase consumption of      natural sources of B6: liver, eggs, wheat germ, food yeast      (one teaspoonful daily sprinkled on cereal, in soup, or in      fruit or vegetable juice), rice polish, brown rice, and      yogurt. If you prefer to avoid the pill, consult your      doctor or public health service about the many other forms      of contraceptives that are available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO PROMOTE CONCEPTION:</strong> Eat whole-grain      breads and cereals, slow cooked. Use corn germ oil and soy      oil on salads and in cooking (keep the temperature below      375Â° F). Take vitamin E d-alpha-tocopherol, 100 units      daily. Use the rhythm system backwards: Copulate during the      most fertile period. During pregnancy, get plenty of      exercise in fresh air. Think happy thoughts. Hear gentle      music, but avoid hard rock even plants turn away from it      and cease to grow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NAUSEA:</strong> This problem usually strikes in      the morning. Keep a few crackers and/or dried apricots by      the bed to chew before rising. Take vitamins, including at      least 5 milligrams of vitamin B6 daily. Don't overeat      during pregnancy, but don't let your stomach get entirely      empty. Carry a packet of sunflower seeds to nibble on.      Share them around. Nobody will snicker you might even start      a style.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CONSTIPATION:</strong> Fast a day or two on fruit      juices, herb teas, and an occasional dried fruit. One or      two mornings a week have a fruit breakfast of apples,      oranges, pears, grapefruit, pineapple, or any combination      you enjoy, with berries in season. Drizzle a little honey      over the diced goodies delicious! A mild, wholesome      laxative: one quarter teaspoon magnesium oxide in a glass      of fruit juice.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO PREVENT OR COMBAT HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE:</strong>      Eat greens-raw in salads and as cooked vegetables-for their      potassium. Eat liver two or three times weekly, and whole      grains and nuts every day. Use rice polish, whole wheat,      rye, oat, and millet flours in baking. Take a papaya enzyme      tablet (available at health food stores) with each meal for      efficient digestion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THREATENED MISCARRIAGE:</strong> Raspberry leaf tea      contains a hormone inhibitor that slows down overactive      glands and promotes an easy delivery at the right time.      Drink one cupful twice daily. The same brew also gives you      vitamins A, B, C, E, and G, plus calcium, phosphorus, and      iron. Eat protein at every meal and snack also creamed      cottage cheese and many fresh fruits and vegetable`      (Cranberry orange relish: whole, fresh cranberries and      unpeeled orange chopped, mixed, and sweetened with honey.      Chopped walnuts can be added.) Soy oil can be used in salad      dressing to provide vitamin E. Avoid sex if you get cramps,      and in any case at the times when you would normally be      having a menstrual period.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO PREVENT TOXEMIA:</strong> This most feared      pregnancy disaster-one that can cost you the baby and make      you very sick-is associated with vitamin B6 deficiency.      Before conception and while you're carrying a child, eat      all the good, high-nourishment foods and avoid sugar,      coffee, strong China tea, and white flour products. Enrich      your diet with kelp, bladder wrack. dulse, and seafood for      the 67 different minerals needed by the body. Take 25      milligrams of vitamin B6 daily if you have been using birth      control pills or if your doctor warns you that you are in      danger of toxemia.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SKIN PROBLEMS</strong> <strong>ACNE OR      PIMPLES:</strong>    </p>    <p>      The cleaner than clean. Wash your hands and face twice      daily with pure soap, warm water, and a soft cloth (pat,      don't rub). Rinse by splashing on clear, cool water.      Otherwise, keep your hands away from your face. Eat      whole-grain cereals and breads, "an apple a day", peaches,      fresh parsley, watercress, sorrel, collard greens, and      green or red bell peppers. Also steamed spinach, baked      yams, dried apricots, cantaloupe, papaya, persimmons, and      grated carrot and raisin salad. Also poached or broiled      swordfish, lamb, beef or chicken liver, and poached or      boiled eggs. Drink milk three times a day and enjoy cottage      cheese or yogurt. Sunflower seeds are good for snacks.      Don't eat candy, syrup, cake (especially frosted), soft      drinks, chocolate, or other hard fats, except for a little      butter. Take daily 50,000 units of vitamin A, 100 units of      vitamin E and a B-complex preparation containing BI, B2,      B6, B12, pantothenic acid, para-aminobenzoic acid, choline,      and inositol.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ECZEMA:</strong> Follow the diet suggested under      ACNE OR PIMPLES, with lots of green salads, sunflower      seeds, whole oranges, and fresh or dried apricots. Take the      vitamins listed in that section, with extra B6 and E.      According to Adelle Davis, vitamin B6 applied to the skin      will relieve itching almost instantly. You can mash the      tablets finely and dissolve them in honey and peach kernel      oil lotion, which is healing in itself.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HIVES OR INSECT BITES:</strong> Wash the skin with      cool water and apply honey and peach kernel oil lotion to      relieve itching. A friend of ours-a hospital administrator      successfully treated severe hives with mashed-up      antihistamine tablets combined with cold cream. Some      antihistamines, however, can increase the skin's      sensitivity to sun and cause even worse hives. I'd rather      stick to my own method.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHAPPED SKIN, SORE LIPS, CRACKS AT CORNERS OF      MOUTH:</strong>    </p>    <p>      Eat wheat germ, liver, and food yeast for their pantothenic      acid and take a 100milligram tablet of the same vitamin      each morning. A delicious natural lotion for chapped lips:      Mix a drop of honey with one-half to one teaspoon of      apricot kernel oil with the fingertips. Apply it to the      lips and rub them together. Try not to lick off the      medicine!    </p>    <p>      <strong>SUNBURN:</strong> Bathe the affected skin gently      with vinegar water, a wet tea bag, or peppermint tea. This      cools the skin, deals with bacteria, and starts the healing      process. Replace the natural oil with apricot or peach      kernel oil lotion. Paraaminobenzamine lotion cools      inflammation, relieves itching, and promotes healing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POISON IVY, OAK, OR SUMAC:</strong> Know the toxic      plants and avoid them. Remember the old warning rhyme,      "Shiny leaves three, don't touch it, flee." The poison      sumac of the northeastern U.S. is a swamp-loving shrub or      tree resembling the common stag horn sumac but with      untoothed leaves and white berries. While camping in Maine      (York County, near the coast) I had a very unpleasant      experience with a plant which a local Girl Scout leader      identified-too late as poison mercury. (I used a leaf for      toilet paper and it took weeks to get rid of the blisters.)      The culprit doesn't look a bit like any of the other toxic      species: It's a shrub two to three feet high, somewhat      resembling the elderberry except that the bush is smaller      and twiggier, the wood firmer, and the leaves shorter and      fatter. They grow three or five sometimes seven to a spray      and are about the same length as poison sumac leaves, but      lighter and wider. The foliage is matte, not shiny, and a      nice inviting apple green in color. The plant grows along      railroad tracks, at the edges of woods, and by roads      through wooded areas. (None of the nature guides I've      consulted list poison mercury. Can any Maine botanists      furnish more information?-MOTHER.) If the worst happens,      take Euell Gibbons' advice and apply the juice of jewelweed      immediately after exposure. Or scrub the skin immediately      with soap and cold water. (Beware of hot water! It spreads      the rash.) Then apply cool soda packs, followed by calamine      lotion to relieve itching. Vitamin C-1,000 milligrams with      a glass of milk every four hours-will help combat the toxin      from inside.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HANGNAILS:</strong> Gently apply apricot kernel oil      to the skin around the nails. Eat more protein, vitamin C,      and very green leaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HORIZONTAL NAIL RIDGES OR WAVES:</strong> These are      often coincidental with menstrual difficulties and indicate      a need for more vitamins A and E.    </p>    <p>      <strong>VERTICAL NAIL RIDGES:</strong> A warning of anemia      (see MOTHER N0. 29) or a sign that you're using strong      detergents without rubber gloves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DANDRUFF:</strong> If the condition arises from dry      skin, add liver, food yeast, and wheat germ to your diet,      cook with natural oils and-for baking mix 1/8 cup soy flour      with each 7/8 cup of whole wheat, rye, or buckwheat flour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INFECTIOUS DANDRUFF:</strong> Wash and brush your      hair well and often. Make your own dandruff-remover shampoo      of one part Listerine to one part shampoo, mild detergent,      or dissolved soap-cake leftovers.    </p>
