            			    <p>      Peaches present the paradox that they'll grow in almost any      part of the country, but can be grown well in very few.      Still, the smallest peach from your own tree will be      tastier than most store-bought ones, even though peaches      ship better than many fruits.    </p>    <p>      The peach needs both cold (below 40Â°F.) and warmth.      Without a winter cold snap, the trees skip their dormant      period and become too exhausted to bear. On the other hand,      the early-flowering buds are very cold-sensitive. One frost      and you're wiped out. And without summer warmth the fruit      will not mature. Even so, the geographical range for      homegrown peaches is almost nationwide, so try a few trees      if at all possible.    </p>    <h3>STOCK</h3>    <p>      Since peach trees are so widespread but variable in      adaptation, it's important to get stock suitable for your      region. There are literally thousands of varieties, and      although there is none best suited for downtown San      Francisco or mid-Manhattan, there is a variety best for      your farm. The trees are for the most part      self-pollinating. But it's never a good idea to have less      than two or three trees of any given fruit.    </p>    <p>      You'll get your first peaches after three or four years . .      . the big yields will take another three. At that stage of      the game you can count on four bushels per healthy tree.      Spring planting is the best. A sandy or gravelly loam is      preferred. Use a northern slope to delay blossoming if      you're in an area of late frost.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      Prepare to butcher your peach tree when you plant it.      Peaches don't take too well to transplanting, so you will      have to cut back the tops severely in order to encourage      root development. Trim the leader back almost a third of      the total plant height, making sure to cut just above a      branch. The new leader will emerge from the junction and      you don't want dead wood above it. Prune all the branches      back to one and two-inch stubs. The effect you want is a      spiked miniflagpole. From the stubs eliminate all but three      or four of the new buds that appear in the summertime. The      object of the game is to develop a tree with three or four      main branches rising together . . . in other words, a      treehouse tree rather than a climbing one.    </p>    <p>      Regular spring maintenance pruning is the same as for other      trees. Get rid of dead branches and shape the tree to be      open and without crisscrossing branches. Also, when the      tree begins to bear, you will have to thin out fruit      growing too close together. One peach to every four or five      inches of branch is plenty for it to bear. Even so, if a      mature tree lets its branches droop heavily with fruit, you      may have to support the branches with braces. Peach trees      are prone to natural pruning, that is, branches break off      from the weight of too much fruit.    </p>    <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      Most peach tree problems will not strike a healthy tree.      And those that are serious enough to destroy the tree won't      be stopped by all the chemicals or anything else around,      unless you kill the tree first anyhow. So sit back and let      nature take its course. Fertilize your trees with      nitrogen-rich compost in early spring to boost plant      growth. Mulch the orchard, but keep the mulch at least two      feet from the trunks to minimize peach tree borers. Prune      away dead branches and those with injured bark, and pick      off any strange bugs or their nests that you spot.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Pick peaches when soft enough to give slightly under light      thumb pressure. You've squeezed peaches at your local      green-grocer's. Same principle, different fruit . . . the      ones you pick ripe off the tree are much more nourishing.      Twist fruit up and out as with others.    </p>    <p>      Peaches not fully ripe can be picked for storage if the      season is running out on you, but be sure not to bruise      them. Even gently harvested, they won't store for more than      three or four weeks in a cool cellar. Make jam of the      extras . . . peach jam rivals apricot for sheer      lusciousness.    </p>
