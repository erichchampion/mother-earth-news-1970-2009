            			    <p>      Pears, like peaches, need to be winter-chilled. In general,      they can be grown in the same regions as apples and      peaches. They are hardier than peaches, but they flower      earlier than apple trees, so watch for chills. Areas of      consistent zero-degree winters are about the northern-most      limit for pear trees, and with such temperatures      winter-killing of the buds may occur.    </p>    <p>      Pear trees do well on poorer soil as long as it's well      drained. In fact, very rich soil will produce overly lush      growth, which in turn will encourage fire blight. Like      Cassius, they should have a lean and hungry look.    </p>   <h3> STOCK</h3>    <p>      Self-sterile for the most part, pear trees are best ordered      in different varieties if you want to be on the safe side,      in which case they'll also need to be same-time bloomers.      Buy one-yearold grafted whips around five feet tall. These      should be about one-half- to three-quarters-inch thick,      with smooth, even bark. Plant in early spring, on a      northern slope where possible to protect them from      premature flowering and a too-hot summer sun. Prune back      about 25 percent on planting and don't use a fertilizer      rich in nitrogen . . . this is one tree you don't want to      grow very fast.    </p>    <h3>PRUNING</h3>    <p>      A minimum-pruning tree. After the initial planting trim,      help shape it and remove root suckers when they form, but      never give it a heavy pruning to boost growth. It would      respond too well, and fire blight would follow only too      often. Also very rapid growth makes the tree literally jump      out of its skin . . . the bark splits, inviting borers and      a multitude of other nuisances.    </p>    <h3>PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      The main thing you have to worry about with pear trees is      fire blight, and it may be hard to avoid in the healthiest      of trees. Fire blight derives its name from the fact that      the affected parts look as if someone had gone over them      with a blowtorch while you weren't looking. It can strike      all parts of the tree from flowers to main trunk, but not      at the same time. This is your key to keeping pear      production going. Trim off any blighted area as soon as you      see it. Branches should be removed with a foot of healthy      wood behind them. Don't handle the affected part and then      the rest of the tree . . . would you blow your nose in      someone else's old handkerchief? Keep all infected      trimmings away from the tree trunk while you work, and burn      them in a hot fire away from the orchard. The worst blight      season is from bloom till fruit . . . this is the time to      keep a sharp lookout for the culprit.    </p>    <h3>HARVESTING</h3>    <p>      Some pears must be harvested before they are ripe or they      turn gravelly. The only way to find out if your variety      falls into this category is to pick some when they are      mature in size but just beginning to turn color, letting      the others ripen on the tree. Compare quality. Next year      you'll know. Pears picked just before the first blush of      color can be cold-stored for two to three months or more.    </p>
