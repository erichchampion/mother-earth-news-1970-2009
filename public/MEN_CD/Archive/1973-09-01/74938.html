                    <h5 id="byline">    by Sini Foskett    </h5>           <p>      Above the 45th parallel<br />      Clarksville, N.H.<br />      Dear Ma:    </p>    <p>      Got to thinking of you ... lent a copy of MOTHER to a local      game warden who told us about some peregrine falcons      nesting up here in the spring. Maybe he'll write you, too.      It's this kind of country: moose in the pasture, fox      running, great horned owl scaring the night and me with it,      dairy farmers, paternalistic old factories with non-caring      wages in an area where prices are as high as in high-income      regions. A place where we had a fight over our children's      hair and they didn't go to school for two months ... and      where I taught swimming this summer to the same kids (and      loved them) that had taunted and tormented my kids. It's a      country we're trying to hold a piece of. We must be into      dream number 357 by now and still trying. If childhood is      the time you feel dreams will come true, then we're still      young.    </p>    <p>      Sweat equity: We got some geese to protect the one hen left      from a raccoon banquet and they're a delight ... so we      bought some chicks to raise in the room where most of our      books are. Maybe this year our eggs won't come to $10.00 a      dozen.    </p>    <p>      Our youngest son helped out a farmer, earned a Holstein      heifer he watched being born ... and he's still working to      pay for feeding her. She's a week old and he's nine. The      other boy is clearing three acres of woodlot to get $60.00      from the Agriculture Department. Our daughter is trying to      figure out ways to get a horse or two. (She can babysit      kids but prefers equines.)    </p>    <p>      The old man, 40, has been working in a factory for the past      few weeks ... 50 hours excluding lunch and travel time. And      I'm home, hoping to substitute-teach during the sickness      season (December to May). Somehow we've managed to survive,      not too cleverly and not too philosophically. It's grubby,      grinning survival, something I reckon we'll be doing      forever. But I figure watching the sunset from our porch,      through tears, is an OK thing too.    </p>    <p>      And I'm into apples, partly because there's a lesson to      learn from them.    </p>    <p>      When we moved to this north country last fall we were      excited to discover three apple trees in the hedgerow      behind the house. Much of the fruit was small and sour, but      they were there. Our very first priority in spring after      most of the snow melted (in the woods up here, <em>in      June</em> , I went waist-high through the stuff to get to      marsh marigolds) was to prune the branches and to clear out      everything that kept the sun from shining in. And as we      watched our "orchard" over the summer we discovered that      the three trees were in fact three different varieties.      Then, on our treasure walks getting to know this mountain      fastness of ours, we discovered six more ... too late to      prune, but in plenty of time to see them blossom and fruit.    </p>    <p>      The first full bearer was the one with the small sour      apples we'd tasted in the fall. There were lots of      pickings, still small and still sour, but without worms or      insects. Crab apples, a neighbor told me, and I felt      ridiculous. That's why the fruit was unblemished: no room      for the worms to pucker in. Still, it's nice to have one      crab apple tree ... more than enough for us.    </p>    <p>      We went on to the rest of the orchard we'd discovered and      most of it had huge fruit-red, shiny and pure-      <em>at the top</em> . Because the trees had been crowded so      much by the surrounding foliage, they'd branched ever      upwards.    </p>    <p>      Gathering our three children and a wheelbarrow, with the      dog's tail flagging our way down the pasture, we went to      pick. "It'll take us ten minutes," I told the youngsters.      We gathered all the low fruit-the little ones and the      green ones-but the sight of those big red apples way above      us was taunting. The bears would still have plenty to eat      if we took those high growers, we thought, though why we      were considering the bears' bellies I don't know ... for      every apple we picked there were ten on the ground, and by      the time we left the tree that ratio would treble.    </p>    <p>      The first boy to go up decided that-rather than      harvest-it was better to enjoy the view or practice      his pitching. With a golden retriever dog along to pursue      the throws this was fun, but a loss in the apple      department. The second child tumbled fruit onto ground      which was protected by old tangled barbed wire and the      scratchy thickness of overcrowded pines. When the      third-oldest and heaviest-went up to weight      down a big limb I figured my 5'10" would stretch to the      sagging branch and I'd get what I could.    </p>    <p>      Over and over I kept the words coming: "Be careful. Be      careful." I shook and picked. Said "Be careful" and reached      higher. Said "Be careful" and got banged in the eye. It      figured. Who was the one who cautioned everyone about bare      feet and nails in the barn ... and then got the barn nail      in the bare foot? It figured, all right ... after all, it      was me that ran down the grassy bank where the geese hang      out and slid for what seemed and felt like three wet green      miles. So the Great Cautioner was led home by the children,      blindly holding one tearing pained eye, with the other hand      resting on the shoulder of the kid pushing the wheelbarrow      of apples.    </p>    <p>      (I still have a black eye ... but I also have a long      sapling with a toeless stocking tacked onto one end. I      reach up with my stick, tap the apple, and most of the time      it slides down the stocking into my hand or a catcher's      mitt held by an apple-pickin' buddy. If I get hit again      I'll wear my husband's old construction helmet.)    </p>    <p>      A wheelbarrow of apples doesn't look like much,      particularly when it's only one-quarter of one tree ... and      the old man came home that night with an enormous burlap      bag full of fruit he'd picked on the way back from work.      "It's a kind we don't have," he said. "For pie and      freezing." (I have yet to find anyone up here who knows the      names of any variety except crab apples. Around this area,      apples sort of get called by what they're used for.)    </p>    <p>      So we started on the easiest way to use what we'd      harvested: apple butter. The boy with the sharpest knife      cut up the fruit, leaving on the peels and cores but no      stems or leaves. We put 16 pounds (a mistake, eight would      have been better) into a big stainless steel pot ...      aluminum and iron are no good for taste. We added water and      cider vinegar-cider or plain water work too, alone or      in any combination-to about one-third the depth of      the apples and cooked the mess until everything was mushy.      Then we let the pulp cool while we got out a big bowl, a      wooden spoon and a large strainer. Another mistake:      everything that shouldn't be in apple butter-like      core bits and seeds-was sneaking through because,      with my determined effort to waste absolutely no apple mush      (not after all that work and a black eye too), I was      enlarging the holes in the sieve.    </p>    <p>      If you're going to make apple butter, get a ricer ... the      old-timey blender machine. You'll soon master the knack of      the proper angle at which to hold it over the bowl so you      can avoid apple mush on the walls. (Old wooden walls come      into their own during canning season. For once you      appreciate their practical quality of absorbing family      stains, including those from temper tantrums. The splatters      don't show unless they hit spider webs and then they're      removed by the resident kitchen spiders, who are far more      meticulous at housekeeping than I am. But then I've yet to      see a web with a <em>family</em> of spiders in it. I love      the old beams in my kitchen even more now, although I was      getting tired of defending them.)    </p>    <p>      As you push cooked apples through a ricer, you scrape the      strained mush off the outside with a knife and put whatever      is left inside the strainer on the compost pile or      wherever. (Our dog digs the leftovers.) When all the pulp      has been ground, it goes back into the pot ... but measure      it first. For each cup of strained apples you'll add about      a half cup of sugar, white or brown. If you use honey      you'll need one-third less of the sweetening.    </p>    <p>      Mix the developing apple butter well, put it over a high      flame, stir it a lot, bring it to a boil, lower the fire      and add your spices. I used eight tablespoons of cinnamon      and half as much allspice in my 16-pound batch. (The      seasoning was ground ... if you use whole flavorings put      them in a bag. An old baby sock tied with cord is fine.) If      you like nutmeg add it at the very end of cooking, or the      flavor will be lost. Grate and mix in the yellow rind of      one lemon, then squeeze in the juice. Taste the butter      after five minutes and adjust the seasonings to your      liking.    </p>    <p>      Boil the mixture and stir it with a wooden paddle or spoon      until a blob of the product on a plate doesn't have a ring      of water around it. This will take approximately an hour      ... but test about half an hour after the boiling point is      reached, because a lot depends on the apples. (My first      batch cooked until 2 a.m.-while I read a good      book-and it's as stiff as dried prunes, but      delicious.) Pour the spread into hot sterilized jars and      seal them with rubbers and tops, or with paraffin. If you      use wax, leave a half-inch space at the top so that you can      apply a quarter inch of paraffin one-eighth inch at a time.      If the wax is too hot the second time it won't make a good      seal ... melt and hold your paraffin liquid in a double      boiler only.    </p>    <p>      After blistering my fingers and failing into the fear trap      of recipes (I forgot the lesson I tried to teach my      daughter ... that cooking rules are an alphabet and not the      whole language), I tightened up and almost quit on apples.      But there was fruit on the porch, plenty of it    </p>    <p>      What the kids weren't nibbling every time they came through      the kitchen door, the dog was snatching while I was busy      chasing the geese. I conned my daughter into making a few      pies to freeze, but baking apple pies sends out vibes to      the world at large and the only way to save them for      stashing is to assemble them in the middle of the night. .      . alone.    </p>    <p>      By now one of the boys was in a contest with himself to      gather apples from the highest branches of all the trees.      Bloody and grinning, he added to the supply. With all that      fruit on the porch and lots on the limbs, I really got into      apples.    </p>    <p>      You can pickle apples, freeze them, dry them, make them      into jam, jelly, applesauce or just about anything ... and      they taste good mixed with other fruit. You can even make      your own vinegar by placing the cores and peels, bruised      parts and dropped apples gathered from the ground into a      crock and covering them with water. Put a lid on the      container and leave the mess to work itself into vinegar.      (Keep adding fruit and water.) The foam on the top-called      "mother"-is what you put into any cider you've made      that you also want to turn into vinegar quickly.    </p>    <p>      Apples have a high pectin content (that's what makes jams      and jellies stay together later on when you open the jar)      so you don't have to buy the stuff in the stores when you      make your own sweets. Just cook the fruit along with the      cores and peels (where the highest pectin level is found).    </p>    <p>      Apple jelly (a good base for herb jellies like mint and      chamomile and rose hip) is made the same way as apple      butter except that you use water or cider for liquid, but      no vinegar ... and you push the pulp through a jelly bag      instead of a ricer. The lower end of an old flannel pajama      leg, with the bottom well sewn together and the top (where      the knee was) closed with a drawstring, does fine. Wet the      bag, put the mush in and let it drip into a pot while you      go and do something else. What's left in the cloth can      become apple butter with the addition of water, spices,      sugar and vinegar, and the juice itself is cooked with      sweetening (about 60% juice and 40% sugar) until the      mixture thickens.    </p>    <p>      Another good thing about apples is that they can be hold in      the cellar while you go ahead with other jobs that can't      wait ... like putting in doors and windows. Apples, in      fact, are fine fruit in just about every way.    </p>    <p>      When an 87-year-old woman came to visit not too long ago,      she mentioned our apple trees. Seventy-five years ago she      used to nibble their fruit, and when she was      married-in the room we call the kitchen-there      was apple pie from those same branches. The trees were here      before she was born ... they should be here after I die.      There are abandoned orchards left all over this region and      they're still beautiful. Next year they'll bloom again      after bearing another winter's snows and I'll learn even      more ... and, yesterday-in the incredible abundance      of this land-I discovered seven red plum trees!    </p>    <p>      To all of you, all over, a happy harvest. Peace, dear      friends.    </p>    <p>      Sini Foskett    </p>
