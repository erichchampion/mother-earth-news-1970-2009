        <p>O ne of the advertising industry's most influential spokesmen, has given the "unlimited growth" segment of his profession a bitter pill to swallow. Far from being a temporary situation that we will pass through quickly, he says, today's energy shortage will not be alleviated for at least 15 years. "To the contrary," states Mr. Weiss, "in at least some of its major aspects it will worsen for practically every one of the next 15 years."<br /></p><p>"We must learn to live a different way," Mr. Weiss says. "We shall have to abandon a style of society marked by profligate production, conspicuous consumption and waste for a society marked by rationalized production and consumption, and vastly increased services."</p>
