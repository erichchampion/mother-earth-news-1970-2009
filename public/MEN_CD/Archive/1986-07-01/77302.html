            		<p>      From Mother Nos. 67, 76, 90, 97</p>            <p>      In five short years, 28 manufacturers have risen to the      challenge of woodstove pollution.    </p>        <p>      MOTHER takes pride in the fact that over <em>five years ago      (in issue 67) we took a hard look</em> <em>at one of our      own favorite forms of alterna</em> <em>tive      energy-wood heat-and admitted that it</em>      <em>had.some serious</em> environmental problems <em>.      In</em> <em>the intervening years, we've shared      current</em> <em>research on woodstove pollution . . .      offered all</em> <em>the advice we could on ways to lessen      one's</em> <em>wood burning impact (including a      build-it</em> <em>yourself retrofit catalytic combuster, in      issue</em> <em>76, page 162). . . and highlighted the new      com</em> <em>mercial offerings-from retrofit      catalysts (is</em> <em>sue 90, page 102) to a new design      that burns</em> <em>so cleanly it could conceivably be used      without</em> <em>a chimney (issue 97, page 24)! The      following</em> <em>pies; condensed from five years of our      wood</em> <em>stove coverage and amended with the      latest</em> <em>news, offers vital information about the      wood</em> <em>burning pollution problem and what you      can</em> <em>do about it.</em>    </p>    <p>      If you've spent any time contemplating the curl of smoke      from a woodstove flue, you've probably wondered just what      was in that cloud . . . and whether it contained pollutants      that might someday be recognized as harmful. But if you'd      asked the experts before June of 1980, when the Monsanto      Corporation completed a study for the Environmental      Protection Agency (EPA), there really wouldn't have been      much they could tell you. Up to that time, there was      precious little solid technical information about the      specific kinds and quantities of emissions produced by      residential woodfueled appliances.    </p>    <p>      Since the alarming results of that study were published,      though, scientists have rushed to get a handle on the      problem. And study after study has confirmed that      woodstoves, particularly the airtight models that became      popular in the 1970s, do pose significant pollution      problems. In some locales, woodstove pollution is quite      serious, constituting the major source of particulate      emissions. And on a national basis, wood burning produces a      significant share of some very dangerous compounds.    </p>    <p>      According to Dr. Dennis Jaasma, a wood-combustion research      scientist at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State      University, the most threatening pollutants are      particulates, vapor-phase hydrocarbons, and carbon      monoxide. All of these substances can be drawn deep into      the lungs through normal breathing and thus pose various      respira tory hazards to those exposed to them.    </p>    <p>      Scientists don't know for sure what the annual contribution      of wood burning may be to the emission of these three      groups of compounds, but estimates have been made that the      numbers are 0.7%, 2.5%, and 4% respectively. (By      comparison, diesel engines contribute about 1% of the      national particulate emissions and are regulated by the      Environmental Protection Agency.)    </p>    <p>      But it's actually a <em>subcategory</em> of the      particulates and vapor-phase hydrocarbons that may be of      the greatest concern. It seems that woodstoves are prolific      producers of compounds known as <em>polycyclic</em>      <em>organic matter</em> (POM). Many POM are known to be      mutagenic or carcinogenic, and it has been estimated that      woodstoves emit about 40% of the total annual load of these      compounds in our atmosphere. The EPA further estimates that      woodstoves produce 90% of the POM emitted from all sources      other than transportation-making them a far greater      concern than fossil fuel-fired powerplants or industry.    </p>    <h3>      The Pressure Is On    </h3>    <p>      The insistence of regulators that woodstove pollution be      controlled has played no small role in the development of      new wood burning technologies, and the ball may only have      begun to roll. Today, Oregon has a regulation that,      effective July 1, 1986, prohibits the sale of stoves that      fail to meet its emission requirements. Colorado, too, has      passed a law that will begin to take effect in 1987.    </p>    <p>      But the biggest player on the horizon is the United States      Environmental Protection Agency. In an uncharacteristic      show of expeditiousness-brought on at least in part      by legal pressure concerning POM from New York State and      the Natural Resources Defense Council under the Clean Air      Act-the EPA now plans to propose a woodstove      emissions rule by January 1, 1987, that might take effect      by the first day of 1988. What this means is that in a very      big hurry (perhaps less than two years from now), the      conventional airtight woodstove could be on its way to      extinction.    </p>    <h3>      The 28 Clean Ones    </h3>    <p>      Today, there are 28 woodstoves certified for sale in      Oregon. (Only 19 of those can stand up to Oregon's more      stringent 1988 requirement.) However, with EPA's regulation      little more than one development season away, you can      expect to see the number of clean burners increase rapidly.      As it's said, Necessity is the mother of invention.    </p>    <p>      At present, performance figures from Oregon's Department of      Environmental Quality (DEQ) make up the largest body of      data about clean-burning stoves. Still, though numbers may      not lie, they can certainly be misrepresented.    </p>    <p>      Consequently, when you go shopping for a clean-burning      woodstove, we encourage you to study performance claims      carefully. Efficiency and emissions offer a good basis from      which to begin selecting a woodstove, but there's more      involved in picking the right heater. The heat output, for      example, should be in a range that's useful for your house.      And it may be important to you that the firebox hold enough      wood for an allnight burn at the desired heat output.    </p>    <p>      One way that manufacturers have gotten noncatalytic stoves      through DEQ testing is to use small fireboxes and prevent      air inlets from being closed beyond a certain point. So,      not all of the stoves listed by DEQ can be adjusted to a      <em>low</em> enough burn to prevent overheating in small,      well-insulated houses . . . and some can't achieve a      <em>great</em> enough output for long enough to keep a      large, poorly insulated home up to temperature.    </p>    <p>      Beyond these practical concerns, several factors limit the      usefulness of the Oregon performance data to consumers.      According to Paul Tiegs, senior principal scientist of 72      Omni Environmental Service-the laboratory that did      most of the testing on the 28 stovesthe listed efficiency      figures are accurate only to within plus or minus 5%. Thus      you shouldn't pick one stove over another strictly because      it can claim a few extra percentage points of efficiency.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, the efficiency/emissions figures from Oregon      are adjusted to suit the climate and wood burning      conditions in that state. DEQ researchers studied the      habits of Oregon wood burners and determined that they fire      their heaters at medium-to-low rates (a heat output of      about 13,000 Btu/hour, or three pounds per hour in a      conventional heater) and in about six-hour cycles.      Consequently, the "weighted" average efficiency and      emission figures you might find in a manufacturer's      literature or in performance ratings on stove labels are      statistically biased toward 13,000 Btu/hour. If you operate      one of these stoves at more or less than that rate, the      absolute efficiency and emissions (as well as its      performance in relation to another heater) could be      dramatically different.    </p>    <h3>      Caveat Combuster    </h3>    <p>      Woodstove efficiency figures are inevitably likened to EPA      fuel mileage ratings for cars. The lessons are much the      same: Though these numbers are for comparison purposes      only-your actual efficiency and emissions "may      vary"-the performance of any of these stoves will be      significantly better than that of your present one. You'll      find that you're getting more heat from your wood      or-if you keep the stove turned down-that burn      time is dramatically extended.    </p>    <p>      If you're burning four cords of $100-per-cord wood each      year (and be realistic about what wood really costs),      stepping up from a 50% efficient black box to a 75%      high-tech stove will save you $130 in firewood alone in the      first year. Add to that the cost (or aggravation) of      chimney cleaning that you can save, and you've got a pretty      convincing economic argument for buying a new stove. The      health argument is even stronger: Using one of these stoves      can be a "Clean Air Act" of your own.    </p>    <h3>      Five Rules for Cleaner Wood Burning    </h3>    <p>      There are some very positive sides to recent woodstove      emissions research. In the last few years, we've learned      more about the physics of combustion than in all the years      since humankind discovered fire. As a result, not only are      new stove designs and aftermarket products rapidly being      developed, but a wealth of information concerning how a      woodstove owner can operate his or her stove in a cleaner      fashion has also become available. The five rules that      follow should help anyone burn wood a little bit cleaner.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rule 1: Use</strong> <strong>the largest-diameter      logs that will burn effectively.</strong> Big pieces of      wood have less surface area per unit of volume . . . which      prevents them from releasing volatiles (a process called      pyrolysis) too rapidly. This has been recognized as the      single most effective operator technique for reducing      emissions!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rule 2:</strong> <strong>Build as small a fire as      is practical.</strong> A stuffed firebox often leads to      areas of pyrolysis or charring (the late, charcoal stage,      of burning) that can't be reached by an adequate air      supply, resulting in incomplete combustion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rule 3:</strong> <strong>Keep the fire      hot.</strong> Position the logs in your stove so that air      can move through the fire zone, and be sure there's      sufficient draft opening.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rule 4: Don't increase or decrease the draft      setting dramatically.</strong> Pyrolysis continues for some      time after the air supply has been cut back . . . so      slamming the damper shut can send much of your hardwon fuel      up the chimney. On the other hand, rapid opening of the      damper can carry the pyrolytic products away from the fire      too quickly.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rule 5: Avoid excessively wet or dry wood.</strong>      Logs that are too dry pyrolyze very quickly, overloading      the combustion zone with volatile gases . . . while very      wet wood can inhibit effective combustion by absorbing heat      for evaporation. Standard air-dried soft or hard firewood      (with 15-25% moisture content) seems to be the cleanest      burning fuel.    </p>    <p>      Woodstoves Certified by Oregon DEQ (as of 4/20/86)    </p>
