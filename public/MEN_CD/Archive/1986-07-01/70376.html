                <p>      <strong>From Mother No. 63</strong>    </p>        <p>      Though designed for the California desert, Jim Harmon's      attractive and innovative home incorporates features that      would prove a blessing in any climate.    </p>        <p>      In the desert region of Southern California's Imperial      Valley-just east of San Diego's urban      sprawl-the ambient temperature can seasonally      fluctuate from a high of 130°F to as low as the      mid-20s, with humidity usually resting at a bone-drying      10%.    </p>    <p>      Nonetheless, folks do live in the area, and it's no secret      that <em>most</em> such desert dwellers consume inordinate      amounts of precious energy just keeping their      air-conditioned homes comfortable . . . especially during      the scorching hot summer months.    </p>    <p>      But one particularly resourceful resident of this arid      wilderness-university professor James      Harmon-has chosen to abandon the conventional methods      of climate control and let the desert environment      <em>passively</em> temper his home all year-round!    </p>    <h3>      Planning Paid Off    </h3>    <p>      Achieving a natural climate control system demands a good      deal of planning and sound research, even in an area of      <em>moderate</em> climate, so in order to make his concept      a working reality in the often-uncompromising desert, Jim      really had to do his homework. The house he eventually      designed [1] rests on a concrete slab foundation that's set      about four feet below the desert floor to take advantage of      the temperature-stabilizing effect of the earth, [2]      incorporates a naturally convected ventilation system that      serves to heat the home in winter and cool it in summer,      [3] uses insulation to the utmost on both interior and      exterior walls, and [4] takes advantage of desirable      wintertime sunlight through the use of south-facing glass      (much of which is shaded by roof overhangs in summer) both      at ground level and within the clerestory wall.    </p>    <p>      When Mr. Harmon first moved to his ten acres of desert      property more than a decade ago, his plans included not      only the construction of a practical, inexpensive, and      energy-efficient dwelling, but-on a more      comprehensive level-the creation of a nearly (or      fully) self-sufficient homestead. And, except for his      modest needs for outside electrical power, Jim has pretty      much accomplished his goal of independence.    </p>    <p>      The house itself is only part of a master layout . . .      which includes organic vegetable gardens and orchards (all      of which are irrigated with underground watering systems),      food drying bins, a workshop, a compost pile, a grape      arbor, a greenhouse, and even a solar-heated outdoor hot      tub!    </p>    <p>      Since construction of a dwelling was Jim's primary project      (and because he scrounged much of his building material      over a long period of time), the resourceful professor      began to plan his structure long before he drove the first      nail. "When you build a house like this, you go through a      long period of information gathering and gestation before      drawing even the first few simple plans .... You've got to      have some kind of idea about just what you want to      accomplish and how your system should work.    </p>    <p>      "The design I used incorporates a bit of commonsense      technology, some ancient architectural methods of the      Middle East, and a smattering of Southwestern American      Indian building techniques. The result is a structure      that's almost wholly passive, uses native building      materials where possible, and-this is quite important      to me-leaves an almost indiscernible impression on      the landscape."    </p>        <h3>      It Works Superbly    </h3>    <p>      Exactly how does Jim's home achieve his goals? First, the      concrete foundation was poured in an excavation 4' deep,      and surrounded with a low block wall that rises up to      ground level. The slab doesn't utilize a bed layer of      insulation, because-being a thermal sink-it      must be given the chance to absorb ground heat in the      winter and, by the same token, to assimilate the home's      excess interior heat in the summer. Other factors were      considered, too: The effect of occasional strong winds is      minimized by the protective natural earth berming and the      low profile of the dwelling. And, as an aesthetic plus, the      line of sight to a nearby tarmac highway is conveniently      interrupted.    </p>    <p>      But that's only part of the story . . . a natural      ventilation system (adapted from Middle Eastern home      design) is the <em>major</em> means of maintaining an      acceptable comfort level in the house year-round. A total      of eight unperforated, 4"-diameter, corrugated ABS plastic      drainage pipes are connected-using vent holes      previously formed in the structure's foundation-to      the sides of the octagonally shaped dwelling. From these      openings underneath the house, the tubes curve around, then      come together (a slight distance is maintained between them      to assure proper thermal conductivity) within a broad      underground channel, and run to a point about 100' away.      Jim figures the depth of this ditch-40"-to be      something of a compromise . . . between a shallower trench      (which wouldn't afford proper air tempering) and a much      deeper chasm (which would be excessively labor-intensive      for a relatively slight gain in efficiency).    </p>        <p>      The terminal point for the tubes-just a 2' X 2'      concrete-block well extending from ground level to a depth      of about 4'-is capped with a reworked kitchen exhaust      fan that allows air to be drawn through even when the motor      is off. Occasionally, use of the fan is required to force      air through the system and into the house.    </p>    <p>      Normally, though, the intensity of the sun (and, in part,      the direction of the prevailing winds) is great enough to      cause the ventilation cycle to operate admirably. In      addition to the underground tubes, Professor Harmon's      design incorporates, in effect, <em>two</em> useful layers      of roof on its windward side: the standard exterior      surface, covered with tar and gravel, and an      <em>interior</em> roof which is nothing more than pine      tongue-and-groove finish sheathing fastened to the lower      face of the roof joists. The upper surface of the inner      roof is lined with builder's foil to form air passageways      within the home's "cap." Jim provided inlets and outlets      for the built-in ventilation channels by drilling a      quantity of 1/2" holes (in circular groups) through the      soffits outside the house, and likewise by opening the      ducts to the atmosphere at the apex of the roof, where he's      built what he calls the "tower of power" . . . which is      also ventilated, through the use of small ducts, to the air      within the home itself.    </p>    <h3>      In the Summer . . .    </h3>    <p>      Hence, during the hot season, as the sun beats down on the      structure's roof with a vengeance, it initiates a      <em>natural</em> convection and suction (see sidebar) that      provides the home with fresh, comparatively cool air. To      help the cooling process during periods of intense summer      heat, Jim also had the fore sight to install      <em>exterior</em> venetian blinds on the south-facing,      leeward side of the house . . . which he closes to prevent      the sun from beating in through the windows. Since these      "light shutters" <em>are</em> external (not to mention      white in color), heat never has a chance to find its way      into the house.    </p>    <p>      Another trick up Jim Harmon's thermal sleeve is the very      convenient cooling effect of evaporation. During the      hottest part of the year (when J. H.'s gardens need the      <em>most</em> moisture anyway), the professor supplies the      liquid by activating his buried sprinkling system. The      sprinklers soak the ground, and as the water evaporates      from the sandy soil, the temperature of the earth decreases      considerably . . . which, in turn, helps to further cool      the incoming air in the underground vent tubes!    </p>    <p>      Mr. Harmon can achieve still more indoor air conditioning      by activating his "swamp cooler": a broad belt of thin foam      pad, revolving in a shallow tub of water, through which      forced air is passed. (Jim also has plans for an indoor hot      tub . . . which could function all year to provide humidity      or heat as required, depending on the season.)    </p>    <h3>      And in the Winter    </h3>    <p>      The same system that cools the interior air in summer also      furnishes a temperate climate during the colder months. And      even though the convective action is not as pronounced in      the wintertime, the design and orientation of the      structure's roof-backed up with the option of      activating the electric fan-assures that comfortable      ventilation is always available.    </p>    <p>      In addition, a considerable amount of winter heat is      derived from direct insolation. Because the sun is low in      the sky, its light can stream unhindered through the main      southfacing windows and the vertical clerestory glazing at      the peak of the roof. Jim has installed freestanding      redwood grape arbors above all the southern-exposed      windows, to provide summer shade and delicious fruit. Come      cold weather, the vines dry up, so sunlight can pass      <em>through</em> the arbors.    </p>    <h3>      An Airtight Thermos Bottle    </h3>    <p>      Of course, the home's unique ventilation system operates      properly only if the doors and windows are closed and the      walls are relatively airtight. But varying <em>levels</em>      of comfort can be attained at any time of the year by      opening the windows as desired.    </p>    <p>      Another factor which contributes to the success of the      Harmon desert home design is the fact that J. H. has gone      to great lengths to properly insulate the structure. The      lower portion of the dwelling is, of course, earthsheltered      . . . and the upper part, framed with 2 X 6 studs, is also      just about impervious to nearly any temperature fluctuation      that may occur. Behind the tongue-and-groove interior      sheathing are two batts of fiberglass insulation, then a      layer of 3/8" plywood. This surface is covered with 1"      polystyrene, which, in turn, is veneered with builder's      foil.    </p>    <p>      The final covering is an exterior facade of      <em>ladrillos</em> , or Mexican brick (similar in its      thermal mass effects to the materials used in Native      American earthen shelters), which is set slightly away from      the backing wall's foil-covered surface . . . to provide an      air space through which excess heat-absorbed by the brick      and reflected from the builder's foil-can escape into      the roof channels. In addition to practicing careful wall      construction, the professor has fully insulated each thick      exterior door to create a thermal barrier and a work of art      in one unit.    </p>    <p>      "It's a lot more economical," Jim observes, "to pay for      good thermal protection <em>today</em> -especially      before a structure is completed-than to continue      shelling out money over the next 10 or 20 or 30 years to      cover the rising cost of heating. And if, after a period of      time, you should decide to add insulation, the cost will      always be greater . . . because of inflation and the extra      work involved in tearing a finished house apart to do the      job.    </p>    <p>      "Profit and loss considerations aside, however," Harmon      points out, "the design of my home is based not so much on      the painful fact that energy costs are rising as on my      conviction that energy consumption is an ethical rather      than an economic issue. Energy waste, whether it proceeds      from senselessness or selfishness, seems to me downright      immoral . . . because it will adversely affect the lives of      future generations."    </p>    <h3>      Sound Construction and Low Cost    </h3>    <p>      Even though his chief emphasis was not on economy, as close      as Jim Harmon can figure his partially earth-sheltered,      1,000-square-foot octagonal desert home cost him about      $22,000 to construct . . . an easytoswallow $22 per square      foot. Of course, Jim is quick to point out that the price      would be difficult to duplicate today, partly because he      purchased much of his wood before the noted lumber price      increase of the mid-70s, and also because he and some of      his good friends did much of the work themselves.    </p>    <p>      But even with the sharp increase in lumber costs, Mr.      Harmon still believes that wood construction is a sound      choice. "Framing a house with lumber remains a good way to      go . . . mainly because if you use some of the synthetics      available on the market nowadays, you'll find they often      are just as expensive yet provide less quality and      longevity. I'd rather spend my money now and get it over      with, and have the satisfaction of a well-done job."    </p>    <p>      Another reason Jim chose to go with wood (in conjunction      with concrete and some of the materials native to his area)      was that he wanted his dwelling impervious to all but the      very worst earthquakes . . . phenomena which are often      problems in the Imperial Valley area. In order to assure      his home's integrity, he designed the structure like a      wagon wheel, with a central hub plate in the      roof-acting as a pivot-from which the "spokes"      (in this case surplus railroad trestle beams) radiate and      fasten to the eight corners formed by the walls of the      house. In theory, this arrangement distributes both      horizontal and vertical shocks evenly throughout the      structure with little or no damage to the framework. In      practice, Jim's design passed the acid test when a severe      quake hit the area and did considerable damage to several      local communities . . . while merely causing the Harmon      home to creak ominously.    </p>    <h3>      At Home in the Desert    </h3>    <p>      Now that Jim's had a chance to live in the house through      quite a few seasons, he's truly pleased with the      structure's performance. Since the dwelling's systems are      almost entirely passive, including its gravity-fed solar      domestic water heater, Jim's normal power requirements are      merely for lighting, refrigeration, and pumping water into      a storage tank from his 330' well. The happy result is that      the desert dweller's utility bill averages only a      <em>quarter</em> of what his neigh bors are accustomed to      paying! (The Harmon household does use some bottled gas for      cooking, but Jim hopes to construct a small      methane-from-compost plant, which should help take care of      kitchen needs.)    </p>    <p>      Otherwise, Jim's ten-acre microcommunity is relatively      self-sufficient . . . with the help of the sun. And since,      in addition to growing much of his food, the Golden Stater      raises cacti for sale to nurseries and the like, the desert      <em>itself</em> provides him with an extra source of income      for a minimum of effort . . . and that's a hard-to-beat      combination in any territory.    </p>    <h3>      How It Works    </h3>		    <p>      Simply put, the Harmon house works on the principle of      pressure differential caused by rapidly moving air. In the      summer, as the sun beats down on the surface of the roof,      the air within the ceiling channel absorbs heat. Because      the heated air has a much lower specific gravity than the      ambient atmosphere, it tends to rise, flow upward along the      channel between the inner and outer roof, and exhaust out      the louvers in the "tower of power."    </p>    <p>      Naturally, with all this air escaping, a new supply must be      brought in . . . and it enters by way of the groups of 1/2"      holes drilled through the soffits under the outside eaves.      So, what results is a constant-sometimes downright      furious-flow from the outdoors, through the roof      channels, and outside again.    </p>    <p>      In order to take advantage of the air current, Jim Harmon      has cut several small openings into the tower, at its      highest point <em>inside</em> the house. As the heated air      rushes past these holes, it actually entrains-or      pulls-the air within the building right through the      vents . . . in much the same way that an automobile's      carburetor draws fuel out of its float reservoir.    </p>    <p>      Of course, since air is then being drawn from the living      area of the house itself, <em>it</em> must be replaced . .      . and the only available sources of supply-as long as      the home's doors and windows remain closed-are the      eight ventilation tubes buried 40" beneath the surface of      the earth . . . where temperature is maintained at about      75-°80°F year-round.    </p>    <p>      During the winter-when the path of the sun and its      intensity result in lower temperatures within the roof      channels-the system still functions, though not quite      as efficiently. Fortunately, prevailing winds from the      northwest, flowing over and around the outside of the      "tower of power," tend to pull air out of the roof also.      And, if this breeze effect is not sufficient to draw warmed      air through the underground pipe network, the blower fan      can always be activated.    </p>
