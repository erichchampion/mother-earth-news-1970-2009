                 		 <h3>Clean Means Money</h3>     <p>      Thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in profits are      generated each year by the pollution abatement and control      industry (known in economic circles as PABCO). Expenditures      for PABCO reached $70 billion in 1985, according to a study      by Management Information Services, Inc. Though most of the      money was spent by public agencies, says the study, private      investments totaled $8.5 billion-which alone      generated over 167,000 jobs and produced $2.6 billion in      corporate profits. The report observed that PABCO has      injected new life into "mature industries presently      suffering from stagnant sales and foreign competition."      PABCO-related activities, for instance, have created over      3,000 jobs in iron and steel manufacturing.    </p>    <h3> Hazel Hybrids</h3>    <p>      Folks in the upper U.S. and Canada can take part in an      ongoing project to help develop high-yield hazel trees and      bushes suited for North America. The Northern Nut Growers      Association is offering packets of special hybrid hazel      seed nuts (eight per packet, $4) to anyone interested in      participating in the program. The hardy hybrids are      fast-growing bushes that reach a maximum size of about 20      feet high by 10 feet wide, and start producing edible      kernels in four to five years. If you're interested also in      joining the Northern Nut Growers Association, a one-year      membership is $15, and entitles you to purchase the hazel      seed packets for $3 each. Write to the Northern Nut Growers      AssociSation, Hybrid Hazel Seed, Attn: S. MacKay, Rt. 2,      P.O. Box 249, Delphi, IN 46923.    </p>       <h3> Beats BHT</h3>    <p>      Researchers at Rutgers University have formulated a natural      preservative from the spice rosemary that is "equal to or      better than BHT." Spices, of course, have been used as food      preservatives for centuries, but the distinctive flavors of      the spices involved have always limited their applications.      The Rutgers scientists, however, have extracted the      food-keeping antioxidants present in rosemary and distilled      away the smell and taste. Within the food industry, BHT is      considered the best synthetic preservative, but it is      possible that the new rosemary derivative may someday      replace it.    </p>  <h3> Eat Hearty</h3>   <p>      The American Heart Association's latest dietary guidelines      for maintaining a healthy heart are designed to promote      optimum well-being without imposing unrealistic mealtime      restrictions. The guidelines: 1) Limit alcohol consumption      to 15°70 of total caloric intake, and to no more than      1.7 ounces ethanol per day; 2) restrict protein      (particularly meat protein) to 15°70 of total calories;      3) limit total fat intake to 30°70 of total calories,      with no more than 10°70 saturated fat; 4) keep      cholesterol consumption down to 100 milligrams per 1,000      calories, with a maximum 300 mg per day; and 5) limit      sodium intake to one gram per 1,000 calories, not to exceed      three grams a day.    </p>       <h3>Cod-Fearing Fish</h3>   <p>      Typically, only about 5°70 of the salmon raised in and      released from Pacific Northwest fish hatcheries each year      survive to return to freshwater spawning grounds. One cause      of the high mortality rate, say researchers, is that the      homegrown fish have not    </p>    <p>      learned to avoid cod, a natural salmon predator. So now      scientists are trying to learn how to literally put the      fear of cod into hatchery salmon. One experimental      technique involves immersing a transparent Plexiglas tank      containing young salmon in another tank full of hungry cod,      which strike the sides of the smaller container. Another      approach is to simply drop frozen whole cod into the midst      of the salmon, startling them. Though still experimental,      the procedures have produced "very dramatic differences" in      salmon survival and may someday be used by commercial      hatcheries.    </p>  <h3> Parks and Pesticides</h3>   <p>      Although it still spreads some 25 tons of pesticides a      year, the National Park Service has halved its use of the      chemicals since 1978, says a report in <em>Environmental      Action</em> magazine (bimonthly, $20; Environmental Action,      1525 New Hampshire Ave. N.W., Washington, DC 20036). Over      200 Park Service employees have been trained in integrated      pest management, which stresses minimal use of chemicals      and applications carefully timed to coincide with the      target pest's natural cycle. The service's consumption of      synthetic herbicides and insecticides has decreased from      100,000 pounds in 1979 to less than 50,000 pounds, while      use of low-toxicity substances such as <em>Bacillus      thuringiensis</em> and boric acid has increased 25°70.    </p> <h3>Bus Saw</h3>   <p>      Yankee ingenuity is alive and well in Maine, where Martin      Madden, Sr., recently converted a 1973 school bus into a      sawmill on wheels. Madden and his son removed all the seats      except the driver's, installed a standard tractor-type mill      behind the seat, then cut through a side wall and added      hinges to create an opening for feeding logs into the mill.      To power the 40-inch saw, he added an outer rim to a rear      wheel, attached an exterior flywheel to the saw, and      connected the two with a drive belt. When he arrives at a      job site, he merely jacks up the drive wheel, cranks up the      bus, and slips the mill into gear. "I'm using about five      gallons of gas per 1,000 board feet," he says. "That's not      too bad for a small, one-man operation like mine."    </p>    <h3>Radon Reports</h3>   <p>      At least 8 million homes in the country are thought to have      dangerously high concentrations of radon, a naturally      occurring radioactive gas that enters buildings through      foundation cracks, faulty slabs, and drainage systems. The      EPA has blamed radon for 5,000 to 20,000 U.S. lung cancer      deaths annually and has warned against smoking in homes      where radon levels exceed four picocuries (a measure of      radioactivity); in New York State alone, 15070 of all homes      surpass that level. According to University of Pittsburgh      researchers, virtually every state has some radon. The good      news: Excessive radon pollution can be controlled.      Depending on the severity of the problem, corrective      measures can be simple and inexpensive (opening basement      windows to improve ventilation) or complicated and      expensive (installing a pipeline to divert the gas away      from the site). For further information, read A      <em>Citizen's Guide to Radon: What It Is and What to Do      About It</em> and <em>Radon Reduction Methods: A      Homeowner's Guide,</em> both available free from EPA,      Office of External Affairs (80 EA), 999 18th St., Suite      1300, Denver, CO 80202. Also, an easy-to-use radon home      test kit is available for $16.95 (or three for $45, for      those wanting to test basement, living, and sleeping areas)      from The Fund for Renewable Energy and the Environment,      FREE Market, Dept. RTK, 1001 Connecticut Ave. N.W., Suite      638, Washington, DC 20036.    </p>    <h3>Fuel Cell Progress</h3>  <p>      Researchers at the Argonne National Laboratory have      designed and built a miniature, lightweight fuel cell      that-if scaled up--could deliver twice the power and fuel      economy supplied by an internal combustion engine of equal      weight. Fuel cells produce energy by converting a fuel such      as methane, alcohol, or hydrogen directly into electricity      by way of chemical reactions that release electrons. Unlike      other working fuel cells that generate relatively little      current in relation to their considerable size, the Argonne      model-which consists of thin, ceramic components      honeycombed together like a piece of corrugated      cardboard--produces a relatively high current density. The      researchers have tested cells only a few inches across that      generate up to a watt of electricity, and are now working      to develop larger, more powerful units.    </p>   <h3>Carbon Monoxide Down</h3>   <p>      The Clean Air Act and, more specifically, auto-emissions      controls are credited with a continuing decline in carbon      monoxide levels among city dwellers, says Dr. Paul      Heckerling of the University of Illinois-Chicago. In a      1985-86 study of 101 nonsmoking adults, the mean carbon      monoxide blood level was 0.77070, compared with 1.5307o in      a similar Chicago study in 1974-75 and 2.0407o in 1970.    </p>     <h3>Greenway Corridors</h3>    <p>      The President's Commission on Americans Outdoors is      considering developing a national network of "greenway      corridors": strips of land along streams, old canal paths,      abandoned rail lines, and powerline rights of way that      could be set aside and used as parks. The commission      suggests that the network be started by establishing      greenways near urban centers, where most of the population      lives; later, extensions could be added to reach into      suburban and rural areas. Local and state groups would be      responsible for establishing and maintaining the recreation      parks, but with additional financial and administrative      support from the federal government.    </p>  <h3> Seminars and Workshops</h3>   <p>      "Williamsburg: An Architectural Odyssey" Learning Weekend      Program (March 5-8); $265 and up (including room and meals)      per person, depending on accommodations.
