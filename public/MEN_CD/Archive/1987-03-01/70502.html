                        <h5 id="byline">      By David Petersen    </h5>    <p>      <strong><strong>"Here comes Peter Cottontail,<br />      hoppin' down the bunny trail, hippity hoppin',<br />      Easter's on its way."</strong></strong>    </p>            <p>      <em>Here comes Peter Cottontail . . . yes,</em> indeed. You      know it's that springtime of year again when you hear      children (and children's TV and radio programs) belting out      the old familiar ditty.    </p>    <p>      "Peter Cottontail" was written by Steve Nelson and Jack      Rollins back in 1949. In the 38 years since, the loony      little tune has become as musically evocative of the      nonsectarian aspects of the Easter season as "Here Comes      Santa Claus" is of Christmas with the Easter rabbit now      almost (but not quite) as prominent as jolly old Saint Nick      himself.    </p>    <p>      <em>Bringin' ev'ry girl and boy, baskets</em> full of      <em>Easter joy, things to make your Easter bright and      gay.</em>    </p>    <p>      How in heaven's name-have you ever wondered?-did a concept      as preposterous as an egg-laying rabbit (a <em>male</em>      rabbit at that) ever manage to become associated with one      of the most sacred of all Western religious observances?    </p>    <p>      Thereupon, as they say, hangs a tale. The story of Peter      Cottontail had its beginnings in the old days-the      <em>very</em> old days. Back then, centuries before the      birth of Christ, the forerunner of the Easter bunny was      already a celebrated figure in the springtime fertility      rites of the ancient Celts. But this prototypical Easter      bunny wasn't a cottontail rabbit at all (they didn't exist      in Europe in those days), no sir; he was a European hare.      <em>Rabbit, hare-so</em> what's it matter, you ask? After      all, they're both furry little critters that hop and chew      and wiggle their noses. Granted, it's a hare-splitting      distinction, but for those of us interested in the nature      of all things natural, it remains a distinction worth      clarifying.    </p>    <p>      Both rabbits and hares belong to the order Lagomorpha      (literally, "hare-shaped"), which almost certainly had its      origins in Asia (like most everything else mammalian) but      can be traced back a good 50 million years right here in      North America. Lagomorpha is a smallish order, comprising      just two families-Ochotonidae, those vociferous      little alpine funny-bunnies known as pikas (sometimes      called conies), and Leporidae, the rabbits and hares. All      lagomorphs have cleft upper lips (giving rise to the      unfortunate expression <em>harelip)</em> and long,      rodentlike incisors that grow constantly to compensate for      wear. But, contrary to popular (and until 1912, scientific)      belief, lagomorphs are <em>not</em> rodents.    </p>    <p>      Thus, rabbits and hares belong to the same family but are      distinct genera. (In descending rank by size, the      scientific classification of living things goes like so:      order, suborder, family, genus, species, subspecies.) And      how can those of us who care to do so tell rabbits from      hares? It's not always easy, as evidenced by the frequency      with which our language confuses the two: In addition to      the original Easter beast having been a European hare      rather than an American cottontail rabbit, the domestic      bunny commonly known as the Belgian "hare" is actually a      rabbit, and the jack "rabbit" is really a hare-just      as the snowshoe "rabbit" in fact is a snowshoe (also called      "varying") hare.    </p>    <p>      Be all of that as it may, there <em>are</em> a few      recognizable distinctions: Most hares are larger than most      rabbits and have bigger ears in proportion to body size,      and most hares have black-tipped ears while most rabbits      don't.    </p>    <p>      Additionally, rabbit kittens (yes, odd as it seems, that's      what baby bunnies are called) are born blind, naked, and      helpless in nursery nests constructed especially for the      occasion by the expectant mother-while hare kits are born      in the open, wherever Ma happens to be at the time, and      enter the world with vision, a cozy coat of fur, and-within      a bare few minutes of birth-the ability to scamper out of      harm's way.    </p>    <p>      To bring all of this to bear on our original question,      then, Peter Cottontail-technically speaking-should never      have been honored in song as the Easter creature because      the prototypical Easter <em>rabbit</em> was in fact a      <em>hare</em> and a cottontail technically is a      <em>rabbit</em> (which is born without hair while hare kits      are hairy).    </p>    <p>      Quite so.    </p>    <p>      The question properly becomes, then: How in heaven's name      did anything as silly as a male, egg-laying <em>hare</em>      ever manage to become so closely associated with one of      Western religion's most sacred observances?    </p>    <p>      Thereupon hangs the remainder of the tale already begun.    </p>    <p>      Just as Easter for Christians honors a resurrection from      death and holds a promise of eternal life, to pre-Christian      European ancients the egg and the hare were important      symbols of the springtime rebirth of nature following the      dead zone of winter. The two traditions, sharing the same      season as they did, were bound to cross paths. To wit . . .    </p>    <p>      The egg as a symbol of fertility and birth - what could be      more appropriate?-has been traced back to the beginnings of      history in a great many cultures. The hare, likewise, was a      major symbol of fertility for many ancient peoples. In the      religious mythology of the Celts, the prolific little      creature was the loyal sidekick of Eostre, the goddess of      spring. Around the time of the vernal equinox (March 21)      each year, this unlikely couple was honored with various      pagan (earth centered) ceremonies-most of which were      intended to assure success in the coming season's      agricultural and hunting endeavors.    </p>    <p>      Thus, the Celts' springtime celebration of life's conquest      over death-with the hare and egg as symbols of this      triumph-significantly predated the arrival of Christianity      in Europe. Additionally-according to the English historian      The Venerable Bede (672-735), the word <em>Easter</em>      derives from the Celtic goddess Eostre, whose name means,      literally, "fertile."    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Adult cottontails will eat nearly any type      of vegetation found in their environment, including your      crops.</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      And so the association of an egg-bearing hare with an      important religious holiday comes clear at last (sort of ):      The springtime fertility rites of pre-Christian Celts,      centering around the hare and his lady friend Eostre,      provided these ancient folk with an important sense of      long-term security-just as the biblical account of the      resurrection decreases angst for Christians today with a      promise of eternal life. Difference was, the Celts were      petitioning their deities for the renewal of the natural      world in the form of children and the replenishment of the      crops and creatures critical to the people's sustenance . .      . while the Christian celebration offered (and offers) its      followers hope, not for the rebirth of <em>nature,</em> but      for <em>personal</em> immortality in a world above and      beyond the natural.    </p>    <p>      Across the European centuries, these two ideologically      divergent springtime observances came to share the same      date and name, and somehow survived in parallel, even      though one remained stringently religious while the other      gradually entered the realm of children's folklore. When      German emigrants came to North America in the 1700s, they      brought the tradition of the Easter hare and his eggs along      with them. Eventually, through the provincial      idiosyncrasies of our language, the hare got transformed      into a rabbit, while his eggs were stuffed into a basket      for portability.    </p>    <p>      To summarize the secret life of Peter Cottontail, then, it      came to pass that out of the ancient Celtic honoring of      Eostre and her pal the hare, hopped our own Easter rabbit      with his basketful of eggs. And the Easter rabbit, in turn,      provided inspiration for "Peter Cottontail," the giddy      little ditty that brings so much joy to the wee folk this      time of year.    </p>    <p>      <em>You'll wake up on Easter morning and you'll know that      he was there, when you find those chocolate bunnies that      he's hiding ev'rywhere.</em>    </p>    <p>      Of course, it doesn't take a pagan to see how the bunny      came to be regarded as one of the ancients' most potent      fertility symbols; everyone knows that lagomorphs breed      like . . . well, like rabbits. Consider, as a particularly      pregnant example, old Peter's clan, genus      <em>Sylvilagus,</em> the cottontails (including swamp      rabbits, marsh rabbits, brush rabbits, forest rabbits,      pygmy rabbits-plus eastern, western, New England, mountain,      and desert cottontails as well as four other species, for a      total of 14).    </p>    <p>      The cottontail is native to, and ubiquitous across, the      Americas, ranging from east coast to west, and from      southern Canada on the north to as far south as Argentina      and Paraguay. Of the 14 species, the eastern cottontail (S.      <em>floridanus) is</em> the most plentiful, claims the      greatest range (all 48 contiguous states plus), and is the      archetypical white bummed bunny that most of us envision      when we say "cottontail."    </p>    <p>      When you consider that virtually all North American      predators-from the tiny least weasel to the gargantuan      grizzly bear, plus myriad other hunters both winged and      human-hold the cottontail to be one of the most delectable      items on nature's menu, the continued survival and even      prosperity of the genus is downright amazing. Sure, old      Peter is adept at both running away (at up to 20 miles per)      and hiding from those who would invite him to dinner, but      the real secret of the cottontail's success is its      prolificacy.    </p>    <p>      To get the reproductive ball rolling, nature has endowed      cottontails with a randiness rivaling even that of humans.      Second, cottontails attain sexual maturity with astonishing      rapidity (females of one species are capable of breeding      within 80 days of birth). Third, the cottontail's short      gestation (26 to 30 days) allows for the production of from      two to six litters during the annual half-year breeding      season (roughly February through August, peaking in May).      Fourth, cottontail litter size is large, with three to six      kits common and up to eight not unusual.    </p>    <p>      Thus, a single Madam Cottontail has the potential of      producing some 50 young per year.    </p>    <p>      And, as if all of that wasn't sufficient to guarantee their      survival, nature has equipped rabbits with some of the      animal kingdom's finest-and least      understood-conceptional shortcuts. Witness: Through      the phenomenon of <em>induced ovulation,</em> rabbit does      release their eggs, not on a fixed timetable, as do most      mammals, but only and always in response to the stimulus of      copulation. This assures that every time a female      cottontail mates, an egg will be in position for      fertilization. A second little-known bunny reproductive aid      is <em>postpartum estrus,</em> wherein female lagomorphs      are capable of conceiving immediately after giving birth,      thus achieving continuous pregnancies. (In fact, in a      remarkable phenomenon known as <em>superfetation,</em> the      females of some species apparently can conceive a second      litter <em>before</em> completing delivery of the first,      thus achieving <em>overlapping</em> pregnancies.)    </p>    <p>      In addition to reproducing themselves in wholesale lots,      cottontails have an impressive potential longevity for such      small mammals, with many species capable of living as long      as 10 years under benevolent circumstances. In the wild, of      course, this potential is seldom realized; the average life      span for adults is just 15 months, with around 90% of each      season's crop of kits perishing of natural causes      (primarily, disease and inclement weather) or taken by      predators. (Human sport-hunting pressure-or the lack      thereof -seems to alter the death rate only slightly.)    </p>    <p>      It's no wonder that mortality is so high among cottontail      kits, since they enter life pitifully ill equipped for the      many challenges and hardships of the wilds. Newborns weigh      only one to two ounces each and are blind, near-naked, and      totally helpless. But small mammals mature quickly, and      after just a week or so of guzzling their mother's      nutritious milk, baby cottontails are furred, have opened      their eyes, and are squirming about in the nest. Another      week and the kits have tripled their birth weight and are      ready to venture out on short treks. Within a month of      birth, young cottontails are weaned and entirely on their      own.    </p>    <p>      Each spring and summer, innumerable "abandoned" cottontail      kits are discovered by well-meaning folk and taken home to      be saved-where they almost always die within a few days. If      you should happen upon a seemingly deserted nest of      quivering bunny young, be certain-before "rescuing" the      little waifs-that they are, in fact, orphaned. Unless you      can locate a dead mother rabbit, assume that she's hiding      somewhere nearby and will return as soon as you leave-and      <em>don't touch the young. If,</em> however, you are      absolutely positive that the kits are orphaned, and wish to      take them home, you'll have to go out of your way to assure      their survival. To begin with, the brood must be provided      with a clean, dry nest box housed indoors or at least      protected from wind, rain, and deep cold. Nurse cottontail      kits on low-fat milk enriched with egg yolks and bunny      vitamins (available from feed stores, vets, and mail-order      houses).    </p>    <p>      Adult cottontails can and do eat nearly every type of      vegetation their home turf offers-including (depending on      season and locale) grasses, forbs, bark, leaves, nuts,      berries, seeds, and cultivated crops (even, in rare but      documented instances, insects). In a phenomenon known      variously as <em>refection</em> and <em>coprophagy</em>      (use your dictionary, or ask a rabbit rancher to explain),      most everything swallowed by a lagomorph is (to word it as      politely as possible) run through the animal's digestive      system twice to assure maximal absorption of nutrients.      This recycling-for-efciency is especially important in      winter, since cottontails neither hibernate nor store food      for the hard months, and therefore must make the most of      any nourishment that comes their way.    </p>    <p>      It's no accident of nature, then, that the annual      early-summer peak in rabbit population corresponds exactly      with the appearance of yummy young green goodies      everywhere-including our gardens. Consequently, in      rabbit-rich areas, Peter and his extended family can      sometimes become first-class pests.    </p>    <p>      Of course, being Earth's ultimate predators, we human      animals have devised a number of ways to combat      crop-raiding bunnies, some of which have proven effective,      others not. The most certain way to keep hungry rabbits out      of <em>small</em> gardens is chicken-wire fencing. If your      veggie patch is too spacious to be economically fenced in,      you can experiment with various organic defenses-such as      bordering your crops with a ring of unappetizing marigolds,      spraying sprouting plants with a solution of hot pepper      sauce diluted in water (one tablespoon per gallon), dusting      both plants and the earth around them with finely ground      cayenne pepper, spraying crops with diluted onion juice      (liquefy several onions in a juicer, or set them to soak      for several days in a bucket of water), or placing old      shoes (the funkier the better) near where the bothersome      bunnies have been feeding. Some folks even create scent      barriers by urinating around the borders of their gardens.      (A few years back, one adventuresome entrepreneur marketed      lion poop as a mammalian-pest repellent. I hear tell the      product proved equally effective at discouraging rabbits,      deer, and gardeners.)    </p>    <p>      More direct (and, thus, more certain) robber-rabbit      remedies include fast dogs, large cats, live-trapping,      and-in rural areas, at least shotguns and well-aimed .22s.    </p>    <p>      But this time of year, before you take aim on a bunny in      your garden with the intent of transmogrifying diner into      dinner, look close to be certain your potential target      isn't toting a basketful of odd-colored eggs. Your kids      would never forgive you.    </p>    <p>      <em>Oh! Here comes Peter Cottontail, hoppin' down the bunny      trail-hippity hoppity, happy Easter Day!</em>    </p>    <hr />    <h3>      RABBIT FEVER: THE WILD BUNNY'S BANE    </h3>    <p>      Tularemia-commonly known as rabbit fever-is an infectious      disease caused by a parasitic bacterium with the lilting      name <em>Pasteurella tularensis.</em> Primary hosts for      these nasty little buggers are rodents and lagomorphs, but      rabbit fever can be transmitted to humans through physical      contact . . . as in preparing an infected animal for the      stewpot. (Thorough cooking kills the bacteria, rendering      the meat of infected animals safe to handle and eat.)    </p>    <p>      In rabbits, the symptoms of tularemia include lethargy and      damage to various internal organs; in humans, the primary      indications are fever and the swelling of lymph nodes.      Although the disease is rare these days and can readily be      cured with prompt medical attention, the threat remains:      grave illness and the remote possibility of death.    </p>    <p>      Country wisdom has long held-and correctly so that rabbit      fever can be avoided by not harvesting wild bunnies until      after autumn's first killing frost; and even then, never      handle dead or alive-an animal that behaves unnaturally.      Today, that wisdom has been indirectly incorporated into      law in most states, since legal rabbit-hunting seasons      almost never open before late fall or early winter, and      generally close before the arrival of spring.    </p>    <p>      So, yes, there is such a thing as rabbit fever, even today.      But no, it isn't a great threat and shouldn't keep those      who wish to do so from hunting and eating wild lagomorphs.      Here are the rules for safety:    </p>    <p>      1. Harvest wild rabbits only during legal hunting seasons.    </p>    <p>      2. Avoid handling animals that indicate by their actions      (or inaction) that they may be ill.    </p>    <p>      3. If you have cuts or open sores on your hands, wear      rubber gloves when preparing wild rabbits for the pot.    </p>    <p>      4. Cook all wild meat thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      The meat of cottontail rabbits and snowshoe hares is      tender, tasty, and healthful. There's no need to let the      remote threat of tularemia keep you from munching bunny.      Just be aware.    </p>    <hr />    <p>      PETERSON COTTONTAIL" BY STEVE NELSON AND JACK ROLLINS USED      BY PERMISSION. COPYRIGHT © 1950 BY HILL AND RANGE      SONGS, INC.
