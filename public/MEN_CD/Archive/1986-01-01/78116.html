        	    <p>      <em>From Rio de Janeiro Copacabana Beach comes an      unusual-and unusually delicious-dessert.</em>    </p>            <p>      A few years ago, when two of our editors were in Brazil to      report on that country's alcohol-fuel program, they were      treated to a unique and delicious dessert called Creme de      Abacate. The dish was later sampled-with great      enthusiasm-by the staff back home. In fact, we gave      it such rave reviews that.we decided to share the recipe      (which we've altered slightly, as noted below) with you:    </p>    <p>      Peel, seed, and mash 3 ripe avocados. Add 1/2 cup honey      (the Brazilians use 3/4 cup sugar), the juice of 1 lemon,      and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Beat in 1 cup half-and-half (the      original recipe calls for 1-1/2 cups milk) and 2 ounces      port wine. Chill the "pudding" and top it with whipped      cream or fresh fruit if desired. The recipe yields 1 quart.    </p>
