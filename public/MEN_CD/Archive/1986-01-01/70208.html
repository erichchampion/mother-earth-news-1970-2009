                <p>      <em>Some chill, hungry day this winter, give this trio of      north-country recipes a try, and see if they don't please      your palate, warm your body, and infect your spirit with      the call of the wild!</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">     By Miki and Julie Collins    </h5>        <p>      Following a trapline some 70 miles through the Alaskan      outback in winter-as we've done for several years      now-is guaranteed to make you as hungry as a bear.      Consequently, one of our favorite indoor winter activities      is cooking. But because of the logistical problems created      by living a long way from anywhere, both our bush home and      our little trapping cabin are equipped with only the most      basic of kitchen appliances-a cranky old wood      cookstove in the former, and a crude heating stove      (fashioned from a cut-down 55-gallon oil drum) in the      latter.    </p>    <p>      So far as food supplies go, we do pretty well as      hunter-gatherers: We usually have an abundance of wild      berries, game, and fish, as well as vegetables from our      summertime garden. But store-bought food-that's      another matter entirely. After paying 32 cents per pound to      have everything from whole wheat flour to pickle relish      flown in to our bush home, we still have to sled the stuff      another 24 miles by dog team to our trapping cabin . . .      all of which, we sometimes think, should provide great      motivation for dieting.    </p>    <p>      It's of necessity, then, rather than by choice, that our      trappers'-cabin meals tend to be simple, one-dish      concoctions, each of which provides a couple of hearty      dinners and at least one trail lunch before the cast-iron      cook pot must be refilled. One of our favorite such meals      is moose stew, which is made with cold-stored potatoes,      frozen carrots and peas, dried onions and parsley, and      ample portions of the main ingredient. Among the more      mundane meals are beans and corn bread, fish and rice, and      chili with corn patties. Main courses rarely get much      fancier than that.    </p>    <p>      But on lazy days spent around the cabin, we sometimes go      all out and make exquisite desserts-such as pudding      thickened on the stove top, pies, tortes, or even ice cream      placed outside to harden on the cabin roof, safely above      the reach of our team of perpetually hungry huskies.      (Sometimes, when it's 50-below-nothing outside, we can      actually freeze up a batch of ice cream right in the cozy      comfort of our cabin, simply by placing the mix in a drafty      corner under the table.)    </p>    <p>      We realize, of course, that few of our fellow MOTHER      readers cook exclusively on oil-drum heating stoves or even      on wood cookstoves, and fewer yet often have the pleasure      of dining on moose stew (a great loss, we assure you).      Nonetheless, some of the wholesome, easy-to-prepare,      delicious recipes we've come up with to meet the demands of      our life in the Alaskan bush can be prepared just as easily      on the most modern of kitchen ranges, and are guaranteed to      taste every bit as good under any      circumstances-modern or Spartan-anyplace in the      world. We've chosen three of our favorites, a bread and two      desserts, to share with you here.    </p>        <h3>      STOVE-TOP FRY-PAN CORN BREAD    </h3>    <p>      1 cup yellow cornmeal<br />      1 cup whole wheat flour<br />      2 tablespoons sugar (optional)<br />      1 tablespoon baking powder<br />      1 egg (or 2 tablespoons powdered eggs blended with a little      water)<br />      1 cup milk (fresh or reconstituted milk powder)<br />      1/3 cup cooking oil    </p>    <p>      Mix the dry ingredients. Beat the egg, milk, and oil      together, then pour the liquid mixture into the dry mixture      and blend with a spoon to batter consistency.    </p>    <p>      Pour the batter into an oiled and preheated 10" cast-iron      frying pan and cook, covered, on a slow stove. If you're      using wood heat, elevate the fry pan slightly above the      stove's surface by setting it atop the ring from a      canning-jar lid. If you're using a gas or electric range,      set the burner on low.    </p>    <p>      Cook for 40 minutes (on a gas or electric appliance) to 2      hours (a slow-burning, woodfired stove can sometimes take      that long) until the bread is done, or-if you're      anything like us-until you grow tired of waiting and      decide to eat it right now, done or not.    </p>    <h3>      BERRY PIE    </h3>    <p>      1 cup sugar (or less, to suit your taste)<br />      3 tablespoons cornstarch<br />      1/4 cup water (use less if the berries are extra      juicy)<br />      2 cups unsweetened berries, fresh or frozen (raspberries or      blueberries are excellent)    </p>    <p>      Blend the sugar, cornstarch, and water, then cook over a      slow stove until the mixture becomes thick and clear. Allow      the cooked ingredients to cool, then gently stir in the      berries.    </p>    <p>      Finally, pour the filling into a precooked shell and allow      the pie to cool for two or three hours (assuming your      resolve is stronger than ours and you can stand to wait      that long).    </p>    <p>      A miserly hint: If you're short on berries, you can      compensate by half-filling the pie shell with cooked      custard, then topping it off with the berry filling.    </p>    <h3>      ALASKAN GORP TORTE    </h3>    <p>      1 cup whole wheat flour<br />      1 tablespoon baking powder<br />      1/2 cup sugar<br />      1/2 cup powdered eggs [MOM's baker used 1 fresh egg, with      excellent results.]    </p>    <p>      Blend the above ingredients together, then stir in:    </p>    <p>      1 cup cranberries<br />      1/2 cup melted butter enough milk to turn the mixed      ingredients into a thick batter    </p>    <p>      Now add 1 to 2 cups gorp (a mixture of any kind of trail      foods, including, but not restricted to, dried fruit bits,      nuts, chocolate or carob chips, minimarshmallows, and      shredded coconut).    </p>    <p>      When stirred together, the above ingredients should make a      moist batter (something like a fruitcake mix). If the      batter doesn't seem quite right, add more milk, flour, or      gorp to suit your taste. (Fear not: This recipe is      generously forgiving if the ratio of ingredients is off a      bit.)    </p>    <p>      Now, pour a thin layer of oil across the bottom of a      cast-iron skillet and spread the batter evenly across the      bottom of the pan. Cover the skillet with a lid or plate.    </p>    <p>      If you're cooking on a wood-fired stove, use a slow fire      and elevate the fry pan slightly above the cooking surface      by placing it atop the ring from a canning-jar lid; if      cooking with gas or electricity, use a very low flame or      the "low" heat setting (you may still want to elevate the      pan on a "scorch pad").    </p>    <p>      After an hour or so, a toothpick stuck into the torte will      come out clean, signaling that your Alaskan gorp torte is      done.    </p>    <p>      Safety hint: To avoid mouth injuries, allow the torte to      cool slightly before scarfing it down.    </p>    <h3>      WARM THOUGHTS ON COOKING WITH WOOD    </h3>    <p>      If you've never tried cooking atop a woodfired      stove-especially a model designed for heating rather      than for cooking-give it a try, using one or more of      the above recipes (which were, after all, concocted on and      for just such an appliance).    </p>    <p>      A well-tended woodstove in winter can provide you and your      family with some of the most pleasant experiences this      chilly season has to offer, infusing your home with a      quiet, mellow warmth. And by learning to use your woodstove      for more than heating, you'll be earning a loyal      friend-a friend who'll serve and comfort you for      many, many years, providing heat, good food, and warm,      glowing companionship.    </p>    <p>      And all a woodstove asks in return is that you feed it      occasionally.    </p>
