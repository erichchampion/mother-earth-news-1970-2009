                    <p>      <strong>FEDERAL TAX BREAKS FOR NONRENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES      AMOUNT TO AT LEAST $26</strong> <strong>BILLION A YEAR      ,</strong> says a study by the Environmental Action      Foundation. According to the report, credits and loopholes      in federal income tax policy cost the country a fortune in      revenue that would otherwise be due from hard-path energy      industries: over $12 billion for electric utilities . . .      $12 to $16 billion for oil and gas firms . . . and $1.75      billion for coal companies. And, says The Solar Lobby, if      you include other federal supports given to conventional      energy industries-grants, loans, loan guarantees, etc. the      total subsidies nearly double: close to $50 billion in 1984      alone. Almost a third of that pie, incidentally, went to      nuclear power, although atomic energy produced less than      100,000 Btu per federal dollar spent on it in 1984. Other      energy sources-including renewables-returned as      much as several million Btu per dollar.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>"THE SOLAR SILVER ARROW," A PV-POWERED RACER BUILT      BY MERCEDES-BENZ,</strong> won first place in Switzerland's      228-mile Tour de Sol road rally. The sleek,      fiberglass-over-steel car has some standard Mercedes      features-independent suspension, rack-and-pinion steering,      and four-wheel disc brakes-plus a not-so-standard 480-watt      PV cell array that powers two 1.2 horsepower DC motors and      charges a silver-zinc battery. The Silver Arrow averaged 37      mph over the final leg of the five-day event, and is      considered a likely contender in the next international      solar vehicle meet: the BP Solar Challenge, a 2,000-mile      race along Australia's east coast, planned for November      1987.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A 76-STORY SKYSCRAPER THAT HEATS AND COOLS ITSELF      USING THE</strong> <strong>BODY HEAT OF ITS      OCCUPANTS</strong> and the warmth from interior lighting      and office equipment has been built in Seattle, Washington.      A system incorporating nearly 2,000 water-source heat pumps      was installed in the 1.5 million-square-foot building at a      cost of about $14 million-some 40% less than the probable      price of a conventional setup. Although electric boilers      will switch on automatically when necessary to keep the      building comfortable, engineers estimate that the heat      generated by people and office fixtures will be sufficient      99% of the time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEVELOPMENT OF AN "AER</strong>      <strong>OSPACEPLANE" CAPABLE OF FLYING UP TO FIVE TIMES THE      SPEED OF SOUND</strong> (a bit over 3,800 mph!) may soon be      under way. Powered by hydrogen-fueled, "air-breathing"      engines, the new plane, otherwise known as a TAV, or      transatmospheric vehicle, would be six times lighter than      the space shuttle but capable of delivering payloads up to      five times heavier. As a space transport, it would fly to      the edge of the atmosphere, where auxiliary rockets would      boost it into orbit. Commercial flights would probably be      flown within the atmosphere. In either case, the TAV could      use a conventional jet runway for takeoff and landing.      Speed doesn't come cheap, though: Congress is being asked      for $2 billion to fund a prototype, and an operational      model, which the Pentagon hopes to have flying by the year      2000, would cost between $5 and $10 billion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NUCLEAR POWER HAS BEEN OUTLAWED IN D</strong>      <strong>ENMARK .</strong> Last year, after more than a      decade of debate between the country's antinuclear      activists and utility companies, the Danish Parliament      voted to approve the following statement: "The Parliament      directs the government to adjust the official energy plans      to include the condition that nuclear power will not be      used. The government shall therefore inform the electric      utilities that they will not receive . . . permission to      construct nuclear power plants."    </p>    <p>      <strong>DON'T FORGET THAT FREE ENERGY-SAVING ADVICE IS JUST      A PHONE</strong> <strong>CALL AWAY.</strong> The Department      of Energy's Conservation and Renewable Energy Inquiry and      Referral Service (CAREIRS) is available to anyone needing      information on . . . well, on just what the service's name      suggests. The toll-free numbers are 800/233-3071 (for      Alaska and Hawaii residents), 800/462-4983 (for      Pennsylvania residents), and 800/523-2929 (for residents of      all other states).    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WATER</strong> <strong>IN CALIFORNIA'S      GLENN-COLUSA IRRIGATION DISTRICT IS PRODUCING POWER AS WELL      AS PLANT GROWTH</strong> now that engineers have installed      a small hydroelectric plant in the system. It's the first      hydro facility in the world to operate as part of an      irrigation network, and is expected to generate an annual      670,000 kilowatt-hours of electricity . . . which, when      sold to the local utility, will yield about $33,000 in      additional income for the district.    </p>    <p>      <strong>THOUSANDS OF SOLAR TELEPHONES HAVE BEEN INSTALLED      IN AUSTRALIA'S OUTBACK</strong> Calls placed of) the      PV-powered phones are relayed by radio waves to      transceivers that can, in turn, connect the remote caller      to any phone anywhere in the world ....    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE WORLD'S FIRST OFFSHORE WIND FARM</strong> is      providing power for the East Jutland community of Ebeltoft      in Denmark. The 1-megawatt facility consists of one 100-kw      and sixteen 55-kw turbines installed along an      800-meter-long pier extending out into the ocean ....    </p>    <p>      <strong>OVER 4,500 WIND TURBINES WERE OPERATING IN THE U.S.      IN 1984,</strong> and at least another 4,500 units were      expected to be up and running by the end of last year,      bringing the totals since 1982-only four      years!-to 12,700 windplants with a combined capacity      of just over 1,000 megawatts ....    </p>    <p>      <strong>PLANS FOR A PASSIVE SOLAR DOGHOUSE</strong> that's      said to keep its cool in the summer and to maintain a      comfortable 72Â°F in the winter (even at below-zero      temperatures) are $9.95 postpaid from Dyna Power      International, P.O.
