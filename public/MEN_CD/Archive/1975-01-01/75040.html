                  <p><strong>"After thirty," says the proverb, "you're    either a fool or your own physician." Maybe before thirty,    too. . . especially if you live in an    isolated spot and/or have a big bump of independence. Of    course, you're a bigger fool still if you meddle with a    serious or persistent condition . . . but both you and your    overworked doctor will be better off if you can prevent or    cure your own minor ills . . . as Marj Watkins began pointing    out in MOTHER NO. 28. Here's another installment of the    health hints that work for her family.</strong></p>    <h3>HEADACHE</h3>    <p>There are many kinds of headaches (see also my remarks      under COLDS in MOTHER NO. 29), and each responds best to a      different treatment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM TENSION:</strong> Get away, have a drink of      water, take a few breaths of fresh air. Massage the back of      the head, the neck and the shoulders, or find someone to do      it lovingly for you. Locate the bundle of nerves midway      between your earlobe and your collarbone and gently stroke      the knotted area on each side with your fingertips.      Experiment to find the most relaxing motion.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM FATIGUE:</strong> Raise the blood sugar level      with dried apricots or raisins and sunflower seeds or      cashews. Meditate <em>or</em> soak in a long, hot herb bath      (don't do both). Bath recipe: two cups strong tea of      lovage, lavender, linden or mint per tub of hot water.      Bubbles are optional.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM LOW BLOOD SUGAR:</strong> Eat dried fruits and      seeds or nuts. If you are also dizzy, enjoy a piece of      sesame seed candy or a coconut and almond bar. Then have      yogurt for instant, predigested protein nourishment.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM ALLERGIES:</strong> To prevent this type of      headache, catch the warning symptoms: eyes not tracking      well together, nervousness, unaccountable sleepiness. Take      100 milligrams of pantothenic acid, 25 milligrams of      vitamin Be and 1,000 units of vitamin C. Have a nap.    </p>    <p>      To treat an allergic headache, clear the allergens from the      head with tepid saltwater nose drops and take the above      vitamins with a tea of pennyroyal, marjoram, catnip or      thyme leaves. If you're allergic to those herbs, too, you      may have to resort to aspirin and antihistamine used      sparingly together (a more effective treatment than either      taken separately).    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM GLARE:</strong> Prevent glare headache by      eating lots of green leaves and apricots and taking 50,000      units of vitamin A before a day on water or snow in bright      sun. Treat the condition by seeking the dimmest possible      place and relaxing with a damp, cool cloth over closed      eyes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FROM HEAT:</strong> Lie down in shade or in a cool,      dark room with head slightly raised. Refresh the face,      hands and neck with water. Sip a little cool water slowly.    </p>         <h3>INFECTIONS</h3>     <p>External infections (of a sore finger, for instance) can be      drawn out by soaking the part several times daily in a      solution of one teaspoon salt to two cups very hot water.      Wounds may be cleaned gently with warm, sterile goldenseal      solution or comfrey tea.</p>    <p>      For internal infections, such as those of bladder or      kidney: Drink plenty of fruit juice and herb teas (comfrey,      chamomile, spearmint, buchu and uva-ursi). Take 100,000      units of vitamin A and 1,000 milligrams of vitamin C each      morning for three to seven days. Eat parsley, cottage      cheese, carrots, okra, apples, tofu (bean curd) and      potatoes cooked without peeling, mashed with soybean milk      and seasoned with kelp granules. Have hijiki soup for      liquid, minerals and vitamin A.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HIJIKI SOUP:</strong> Pour three cups of boiling      water over a walnut-sized lump of dried hijiki seaweed, one      bouillon cube and two slices of fresh ginger finely diced      (or one-third teaspoon of powdered ginger). Simmer the      mixture covered for ten minutes. Add one large bok choy      leaf (with the stem) or two spinach leaves, diced in      half-inch squares, and one green onion-foliage and      all-finely sliced. Boil the soup two minutes and      serve it to three people. (We enjoy this eaten from rice      bowls with, china spoons. You can sip much hotter liquid      from a china spoon than a metal one without burning your      mouth.)    </p>      <h3>MENSTRUAL PROBLEMS</h3>       <p>      <strong>TIMING:</strong> A chill from cold weather,      swimming or a cold shower can delay the onset of a period.      Hot showers, scrubbing floors on hands and knees or a sex      orgy can bring it on a day or two early.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO DECREASE FLOW:</strong> Take uvaursi herb tea.      (Uva-ursi is the Indian <em>kinnikinick,</em> or bearberry.      Steep a heaping teaspoon of dried leaves in two cups of      boiling water and drink half a cup every four hours. The      same infusion can be mined and used as a douche.)      Raspberry, witch hazel and burnet teas are also good.      Abstain from sex the day before menstruation and the day of      its onset.    </p>    <p>      Heavy flow that goes on and on can cause anemia, and can      also indicate uterine cancer. If it continue, as long as      three days, make an appointment with your gynecologist.      Meanwhile, enjoy prayer and meditation.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TO INCREASE FLOW:</strong> Fennel seed, marjoram,      thyme, chamomile, catnip, ginger and summer savory increase      menstrual flow, relieve tension and help allay cramps.    </p>    <p>      Scant or non-existent flow can mean pregnancy,      malnutrition, menopause or extreme nervousness or tension.      Again, consult a doctor . . . and in the meantime amend      your diet to include more dairy products, liver, eggs,      seafood and vitamin E-rich whole grains and unrefined corn      germ, sesame and soy oils. Sprinkle a pinch or two of      granulated or powdered kelp on your cereal, add it to soups      and stews or have hijiki soup. These foods encourage your      thyroid gland.    </p>    <p>      To regulate your reproductive organs' functioning, take      vitamin E d-alpha-tocopherol as directed under ACHES AND      PAINS in MOTHER NO. 28.    </p>         <h3>PARASITES</h3>   <p>      <strong>FLEAS:</strong> One-quarter teaspoon of vinegar      mixed with a cat's food each day for three days will help      get rid of fleas and aid the, cat in producing its own      vitamin C to ward off infections.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WORMS:</strong> Intestinal parasites seldom infest      an animal or person who gets plenty of wholesome food      (pinworms love sugar). Worms can be eliminated with gentian      violet, but if the diet is too low in protein, vitamin A      and the B complex, they will come back. In any case of      infestation by worms or amoebas, 100,000 units of vitamin A      daily will shore up the ailing intestinal fining and hasten      recovery. Permanently increase the amount of raw and cooked      greens, carrots, dried apricots, liver, etc., in the diet      to prevent the parasites' return.    </p>    <p>      Catnip, sorrel, hyssop, vervain, chamomile and nettle teas,      or the first five herbs nibbled, are old worm remedies.      Another-more immediately effective but less      pleasant-is to eat gar- and pumpkin seeds at night,      followed by castor oil in the morning.    </p>
