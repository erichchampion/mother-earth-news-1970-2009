            		<p>ASK OUR EXPERTS</p>          <p>      Home-built walls, home-brewed pollution    </p>        <p>      <strong>I'm planning to build an in-ground, passive      solar home in southwestern Wisconsin. My question: Can I      successfully use oak logs for the main structure? Could      they be properly water-proofed before backfilling? I know      that the usual material is concrete block, but I have 60      acres of white oaks in desperate need of thinning. Right      now they're just being cut for firewood.</strong>    </p>    <p>      It's no doubt possible to use white oak logs in an      earth-sheltered house. My question: Do you really want to?      Will the effort and cost be acceptable? Assuming you want a      house that will still be around half a century from now,      here are a few of the things you should worry about.    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. Structure.</strong> You must find a way to      secure the logs to the footings to resist sliding forces.      This could be done by setting threaded rod in the footings,      slipping the bottom course over the rods and snugging the      log to the footing with nuts. Each subsequent course should      be secured to at least the previous two with pins at the      joints, and staggered at several locations between joints.      Traditional log corners may not offer enough resistance to      over-tipping forces unless they are heavily reinforced (by      steel rod passing from top to bottom and into the footing,      and possibly by a bond beam) and buttressed (by right-angle      walls that are secured to the footing and pinned). The      sizes and spacing of reinforcing elements will depend on      the height of the walls, the soil type and the length of      unbuttressed walls. This is a job for an engineer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. Waterproofing.</strong> An irregular surface      with gaps-the typical outside profile of a log      building-would place undue demands on a waterproofing      membrane. It's unlikely that any manufacturer would      recommend use of its product unless the logs are square on      three sides to present a smooth, uninterrupted exterior      surface. As an alternative, it might be possible to fill      the gaps between the logs with chinking, affix insulating      panels over this more or less even surface and then apply      the waterproofing membrane.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. Rot resistance.</strong> Even if the      waterproofing system keeps outside moisture out, there's      likely to be some condensation inside. It would be a good      idea to apply a preservative to the logs before installing      them.    </p>    <p>      Personally, if someone dropped a couple    </p>    <p>      of semi-truck-loads of white oak logs in my yard, I'd build      an aboveground house or heat my concrete earth-sheltered      house for several generations.    </p>    <p>      <em>-David Schoonmaker<br />      David Schoonmaker is a senior research editor for</em>      <em>MOTHER.</em><br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>Inside Air</strong><strong>I read recently that      formaldehyde is a leading indoor pollutant, particularly in      manufactured housing. As a mobile home resident, I'm      concerned-and confused.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Formaldehyde?</em> Outside a biology      classroom?</strong><br />      It's not just for embalming anymore. Pure formaldehyde is a      colorless gas with a pungent, suffocating odor. Most of us      have encountered it in two forms: dissolved in water (a      formaldehyde solution) for preserving specimens for      high-school biology; and as a small part of the air we      breathe in office buildings and homes-especially      mobile homes. Even though the Consumer Products Safety      Commission banned the use of ureaformaldehyde foam      insulation in 1982, we're still exposed to formaldehyde      off-gassing from building materials, notably the glues and      mastics used to make plywood and laminated paneling, to      hold carpets and tiles in place and to make furniture.    </p>    <p>      Formaldehyde in the air has two kinds of health effects.      First, it irritates the eyes, nose, throat and lungs. (Some      people are more sen sitive than others.) More ominously, in      April 1987 the EPA classified inhaled formaldehyde as a      probable human carcinogen. Because concentrations are      higher in mobile homes, in 1984 the Department of Housing      and Urban Development limited the amount of the gas that      can be emitted from plywood and from particle board floor      decking and cabinetry installed in mobile homes, with an      eye toward keeping ambient levels below 0.4 parts per      million. Federal agencies have not yet issued new standards      in response to the reclassification of formaldehyde as a      carcinogen, but new rules may well be on the horizon.    </p>    <p>      There are tests available to measure the amount of      formaldehyde in your home, but they're not inexpensive. You      can contact your state's environmental agency or public      health department for leads. Meanwhile, weather and energy      conservation permitting, you may want to keep a window open      or consider an air-to-air exchanger.    </p>    <p>      <em>-David Burmaster<br />      David Burmaster, Ph.D.,<br />      is a consultant on indoor air pollution.</em>    </p>    <p>      If you'd like our panel of consultants to answer a question      concerning some aspect of self-reliant living that has you      stumped, send it to Ask Our Experts, <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>,      P.0.
