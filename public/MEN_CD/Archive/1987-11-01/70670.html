            		<p><strong>EARTH DIARY</strong></p>        <p>      <em>Damned if you do, dammed if you don't.</em></p>      <h5 id="byline"><em>By Tom Turner</em>    </h5>        <p>      John Muir, the<br />founder of the<br />Sierra Club, in<br />Hetch Hetchy<br />      Valley.    </p>    <p>      Interior Secretary Donald P. Hodel stunned California      environmentalists and politicians August 6 when he      suggested tearing down O'Shaugnessy Dam in Yosemite      National Park. Hodel, who has been harshly criticized by      environmental leaders for insensitivity to the natural      landscape, is said to have dreamed up the idea on his own.    </p>    <p>      The most intemperate reaction came from Dianne Feinstein,      mayor of San Francisco.    </p>    <p>      "The worst idea since selling arms to Iran," she railed.      The Sierra Club praised the idea, saying that the dam in      Hetch Hetchy Valley was the oldest blot on the national      park system.    </p>    <p>      Other environmentalists were skeptical of Mr. Hodel's      motives, wondering, for example, if he was hoping to      deflect the public's attention from ecological concerns in      Alaska long enough for him to persuade Congress to let      oilmen into the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.    </p>    <p>      The San Francisco newspapers were quick to judge the      proposal. "Hands off, Mr. Secretary," warned the      <em>Chronicle</em> . "The best argument yet for drug      testing of federal employees," thundered the      <em>Examiner</em> .    </p>    <p>      To understand the reactions of Ms. Feinstein and the local      press, one must realize that by virtue of heroic wheeling      and dealing in the first part of this century, the city of      San Francisco owns one of the sweetest deals for water and      power of any city in the land. Enshrined in a law known as      the Rak er Act, San Francisco has rights to a fair fraction      of the pure, sweet water that flows down the Tuolumne River      from the Yosemite high country. The city also operates      several power plants on the river, which earned it a tidy      profit of $50 million last year.    </p>    <p>      But let's stop and think about this for a minute. What      right does a city have to defile a national park the way      San Francisco does with this benighted reservoir? If the      city-any city-tried to build a dam in the      middle of a national park today, it would be run out of      town. Mr. Hodel's motives may be other than he says they      are, but that doesn't make the idea a bad one.    </p>    <p>      Indeed, conservationists have advocated demolishing Hetch      Hetchy dam for decades. And most important, it seems to me,      is a very curious if unspoken assumption in all this: that      dams <em>create</em> water. Put that way, it is ridiculous,      of course. But that's what Mayor Feinstein and the others      are saying when they scream that tearing down the dam will      deprive San Francisco of its water supply.    </p>    <p>      Water flows from the sky as rain and snow, runs down hills      and cliffs and winds up in a river. It will keep doing so      as long as it keeps raining, dam or no dam. What's more,      San Francisco doesn't take its water from the river at      Hetch Hetchy anyway: Its intake pipes are below the      Moccasin Creek Power Station 40 miles downstream.    </p>    <p>      And what an absolutely magnificent idea! Hetch Hetchy      Valley was a near carbon copy of Yosemite Valley. The dam      that drowned the valley and killed the river is said to      have killed John Muir, the founder of the Sierra Club, as      well. What a splendid monument to the environmental sanity      that is finally beginning to dawn on this country to remove      that wretched concrete plug and watch as nature slowly      reclaims its own.    </p>    <p>      Tom Turner, a writer and editor who's worked in the      environmental field for 17 years, is with the Sierra Club      Legal Defense Fund, an independent environmental law firm      that represents many orgamzations across the country. It is      supported principally by private donations. For more      information, write Sierra Club Legal Defense    </p>    <p>      Fund, 2044 Fillmore St., San Francisco, CA 94115.    </p>
