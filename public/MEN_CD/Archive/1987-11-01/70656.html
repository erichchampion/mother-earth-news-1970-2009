        <p>Recipes for memorable holiday snacking.</p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> is staffed by tough, seasoned professionals, able to work under good conditions or bad. And if journalistic enterprise and editorial integrity force us to sample fresh-baked cookies day after day, week after week-well, we're up to it.</p><p>"Send us your best recipe," we said in issue 106, announcing our Great Christmas Cookie contest. And you did-almost 200 of you. We sifted through the entries and gave the likely-looking ones to our test bakers, who brought the finished products into the office.</p><p>"Cookie test!" Typewriters stopped; conversations ended; offices emptied. Editors and shippers, illustrators and typesetters, administrators and receptionists quick-marched through the halls toward a long table holding half-a-dozen varieties of Christmas cookies.</p><p>And now, after two months of such hardships, we've arrived at our 10 favorites.</p><p>How did we select the winners? We discussed each batch at length, of course: "Great texture." "Too much salt." "An interesting twist on an old recipe." But there were other indications when we found a really great cookie. People lingered around the table to debate fine points of editorial policy-between bites. They left with groaning plates, explaining, "I know this looks like a lot, but some of these are for my office mates." They returned five and six times, trying to look investigative, instead of greedy. They demanded recipes. ("It'll probably be in the magazine." "I want it now.") They left only a few lonesome crumbs at the end of the day. And weeks later, while they nibbled a cookie that failed to inspire them, they waxed nostalgic: "Remember the cherry walnut bars?" Sighs all around.</p><p>Two notes about our testing. First, our bakers used exactly the ingredients specified. If butter was listed, we did not substitute margarine. If there were alternative ingredients, we used the first one. Second, remember that oven thermostats vary widely. We'd suggest that you bake a few test cookies first, to avoid scorching or under baking an entire batch. So here you have them-our 10 favorite recipes from dozens sent to us by our talented readers. We'd recommend that you try every one of them. After all, we've already done the hard part.</p><p><strong>Fruitcake Cookies</strong></p><p>Most MOTHER staffers subscribe to the theory that there's only one fruitcake in the world, and each year it gets passed from person to person. But every last one of us <em>loved</em> these cookies. 6 cups chopped pecans<br />1 1/2 pounds candied pineapple<br />1 pound candied cherries<br />1 pound dates 1 pound white raisins<br />1 teaspoon baking soda<br />3 tablespoons buttermilk<br />1/2 teaspoon nutmeg<br />1 teaspoon cinnamon<br />1 /4 teaspoon salt<br />4 cups all-purpose flour<br />1 cup light brown sugar<br />1 cup butter or margarine<br />4 eggs<br />1/2 cup brandy Preheat oven to 300°F. Chop nuts and fruit. In very large mixing bowl, dissolve soda in buttermilk. Add all remaining ingredients and drop by heaping teaspoonfuls onto cookie sheet. Bake for 25 minutes. You can vary the amount of batter dropped to produce the size cookie you prefer; 1 1/2 teaspoons rum flavoring may be substituted for the brandy. Note: This recipe yields between 5 and 6 dozen cookies. It's easy to halve if you want to make fewer.<br />Helen S. Hogg<br />Saline,Louisiana<br /><strong>Coconut Cornucopias</strong>These elegant cookies use three ingredients treasured by holiday cooks: coconut, brandy and whipped cream.Cookies:<br />1/4 cup butter or margarine<br />1 1/2 cups shredded and chopped coconut<br />3/4 cup sugar<br />2 eggs<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />1/2 cup flour<br />1 /2 teaspoon baking powder<br /></p><p>1/2 teaspoon salt Melt butter in saucepan. Add coconut and cook until browned, stirring constantly. Remove from heat and add sugar, mixing well. Cool to room temperature. Preheat oven to 375°F. Place cooled mixture in mixing bowl, add eggs and vanilla, and beat well. Add flour, baking powder and salt and mix well. Drop from teaspoon onto greased baking sheet. Bake for 10 minutes. Remove promptly from baking sheet and roll each soft cookie around the handle of a wooden spoon (or a pencil or pen), turning the bottom side in to form the cone-shaped cornucopia. If the cookies harden too quickly, return to oven 'until soft. Fill with whipped cream mixture and decorate with sprinkles, if desired. <em>Filling:</em><br />2 cups whipped cream<br />1 tablespoon peach brandy<br />1 tablespoon plus 1 teaspoon shredded orange peel Blend ingredients and use paper cone or knife to fill cornucopias. Note: Most of MOTHER's testers preferred somewhat more brandy and a tad less orange peel.<br /><em>Fan Cross<br />Brooksville, Florida</em></p><p><strong>Cherry Walnut Bars</strong> Our resident sweets-hater ("How can you people eat that stuff?") was discovered with a stack of these in her desk drawer. Cookies:<br />2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1 cup butter, softened<br />2 eggs<br />1 cup brown sugar<br />1 /2 teaspoon salt<br />1 /2 teaspoon baking powder<br />1/2 teaspoon vanilla<br />1 /2 cup chopped maraschino cherries (reserve juice)<br />1/2 cup chopped walnuts<br />1/2 cup chopped coconut Preheat oven to 350°F. In medium bowl, mix together flour, sugar and butter and press mixture into 9 X 12 pan. Bake for 20 minutes. In large bowl, blend together eggs, sugar, salt, baking powder and vanilla.

Frosting: 2 tablespoons butter, softened 2 cups powdered sugar frosting. <em>Frosting:<br /></em>2 tablespoons butter, softened<br />2 cups powdered sugar<br />Maraschino cherry juice Beat together butter, sugar and enough cherry juice to produce a spreadable icing.<br />Robert Hartley<br />Kingston, Illinois</p><p><strong>Meltaways</strong> This buttery little cookie has a superb, melt-in-your mouth texture. 1 cup sifted all-purpose flour<br />1 cup cornstarch<br />1 cup butter, softened<br />1/2 cup powdered sugar<br />1/8 teaspoon salt<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />Powdered sugar Sift flour and cornstarch together and set aside.

Line cookie sheet with aluminum foil, then with waxed paper. In large mixing bowl, combine egg whites, cream of tartar and salt and beat until mixture peaks. Beat in sugar, a little at a time. Fold in chips and food coloring. Drop batter by teaspoonfuls onto lined cookie sheet. Since cookies will not change shape during baking, you may want to gently reshape any that look particularly unattractive when dropped. Place cookies in heated oven, turn off heat, and leave cookies in the oven for about 2 hours.<br /><em>Rosanne Funk<br />Ray City, Georgia</em></p><p><strong>Busia's Yuletide Cookies</strong> 1/2 cup unsalted butter, softened<br />1/3 cup sugar<br />1 large egg, separated<br />1/4 teaspoon vanilla<br />1/4 teaspoon almond extract<br />1 cup all-purpose flour<br />3/4 teaspoon salt<br />3/4 cup chopped walnuts or pecans<br />Strawberry or apricot preserves In large mixing bowl, cream butter and sugar until light and fluffy.

Using index finger or end of wooden spoon, make indentation in middle of each cookie. Bake 25 minutes and remove to wire rack. While cookies are still warm, put a dab of preserves in each indentation.<br />Busia Savatski<br />Pewaukee, Wisconsin</p><p><strong>Giant Oatmeal Spice Cookies</strong> These huge, flavorful cookies would make excellent stocking stuffers. 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour<br />1 /2 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 teaspoon baking soda<br />2 teaspoons cinnamon<br />2 teaspoons allspice<br />1-2 teaspoons cloves (we preferred the lesser amount)<br />1 teaspoon ginger<br />1 cup butter or margarine, softened<br />1 cup sugar<br />1 cup packed brown sugar<br />2 eggs<br />1 teaspoon vanilla<br />3 cups quick-cooking oats<br />1 cup chopped nuts (optional) Preheat oven to 375°F.

Allow to cool slightly on cookie sheets, then remove to wire racks to cool completely.<br /><em>Beverly Bracken<br />Lorena, Texas</em></p><p><strong>Mocha Chocolate Cookies</strong> Note to chocoholics: Two of our tasters said, "Good, but too chocolatey." Everyone else simply moaned. 1 12-ounce package semisweet choco late chips, divided<br />2 tablespoons instant coffee<br />2 teaspoons boiling water.<br />1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour<br />3/4 teaspoon baking soda<br />1/2 teaspoon salt<br />1/2 cup butter, softened<br />1/2 cup sugar<br />1/2 cup brown sugar<br />1 egg<br />1 cup chopped walnuts Preheat oven to 350°F.

We won't argue. 1 pound butter, softened<br />2 cups dark brown sugar<br />1 1/2 cups granulated sugar<br />2 tablespoons vanilla extract<br />3 large eggs<br />6 cups all-purpose flour<br />3/4 teaspoon salt<br />1 1/2 teaspoons baking soda<br />2 cups chopped pecans<br />4 cups white chocolate chips* Preheat oven to 350°F.
