        <h5 id="byline">Story and Illustrations by Will Shelton</h5><p>Mother's stationery pit uses a 16" x 32", drop-in grill unit with a built-in charcoal tray that adjusts up and down to regulate the amount of heat at the cooking surface.</p><p>We built firebricks around the grill unit and used fire clay mortar or refractory cement to joint them in place. For layout and planning purposes, the nominal size of these bricks is 9 x 2 1/2x 4 1/2. If your fire bricks need to be cut, have a masonry supply store do it, or use the old hammer and chisel after scribing the cut line.</p><p>To construct the inner core you'll need common concrete building blocks, sized 12 1/2 x 7 1/2 x 5 1/2. The cap or top of the structure is entirely up to your discretion. The most common materials used are flagstone, red brick or simply a leveled surface of cement. No matter what material you select, be sure to seal it with a good coat of waterproofing masonry sealer.</p><div class="sidebar"><p>Tools<br />• Shovel<br />• Pick<br />• Wheelbarrow (to mix and dump cement and carry rocks.)<br />• Cement mixing hoe<br />• Trowel<br />• 4-foot level<br />• Grout bag<br /></p><p>Materials<br />The following materials are based on a 4' x 6' foot print. This will all vary, depending on the dimensions of the drop-in BBQ unit you use.<br />• 1 60-pound bag fire clay mortar<br />• 10 60-pound bag mortar<br />• 40 firebricks<br />• 18 concrete blocks<br />• Heavy wire mesh (reinforcement)<br />• 1/4" reinforcement bars (rebar)<br />• 1/2 yard foundation stones<br />• 1/2 yard foundation gravel<br />• 24 60-pound bags cement<br />• 2 x 6 foundation forms<br />• 2 x 4 foundation posts</p></div><p>To securely tie all these components together, first you will need 1/4" rebar, placed in a grid pattern with a 6" to 9" spacing in the concrete portion of the foundation. Second, you'll need a layer of heavy-gauge wire mesh set between each concrete block layer and between the first layer of block and the foundation. Let the wire extend 6" to 9" out all the way around the block so that you can weave the wire between the fieldstones and mortar. In some instances it will be necessary to cut the wire to bend it to the shape needed, so have a good pair of wirecutters handy.</p><h3>STEP 1: THE FOUNDATION</h3><p>• Dig a hole to a depth of 24". Install posts and 2x6 boards (keep the boards level). Add layers of sand and large stones, then add the smaller stones and work in more sand. <em>Note: after the large stones are in the pit, shovel in a layer of sand. To work the sand down into the crevices, hose it down with water. Use just enough water to work the sand into the voids. Keep adding sand until the rocks are just covered.</em></p><p>• Add a 2" layer of sand and tamp it down. Keep adding and tamping until it's flush with the bottom of the 2x6 forms.</p><p>• Mix and add post hole concrete. When you have filled the form with 3" of concrete mix lay the 1/4" rebar horizontally in the concrete before pouring the remaining mix.</p><p>• Screed the top flat using a 2x4. Keep the surface wet for 48 hours, using watersoaked burlap bags.</p><h3>STEP 2 THE INNER CORE</h3><p>• After the foundation has "cured" for at least 48 hours, wet the top of the foundation and put down a half-layer of mortar in the footprint where the concrete blocks will be placed. Add the wire mesh, working it into the mortar.</p><p>• Lay the first course of blocks. (Wet the bottom of the blocks in a shallow tray of water before setting them in the mortar. If you don't, the blocks will siphon the water out of the mortar causing the mortar to be weak and crumbly.) Level the top of the blocks and wet them with fine spray from a hose. Add mortar and wire mesh.</p><p>• Continue this process until all of the blocks are in place. Add mortar but do not add wire mesh atop the third layer.</p><p>• Keep the structure wet for 48 hours with the soaked burlap bags.</p><h3>STEP 3: THE FIREBRICK PIT</h3><p>• As always, premoisten the cured layer of mortar and lay down a bed of fire clay mortar on top of the regular mortar. Lay the firebricks and ensure that each brick is level and flush.</p><p>• Build up the back and side walls one layer at a time. (Unlike conventional bricklaying, you want to keep the grout layer very thin between bricks.) Remember to presoak each brick before installing it. Firebricks are very absorbent.</p><p>• Leave a 1/8" space between the brick enclosure and the edges of the installation hanger (see illustration).</p><p>• Keep the bricks wetted down for 48 hours.</p><h3>STEP 4: THE OUTER FIELDSTONE LAYER</h3><p>• Wash all fieldstones until they are free of dust and dirt.</p><p>• Wet down the slab and block where the bottom layer of stones and mortar will be installed. Moisten as necessary.</p><p>• Lay the fieldstones and mortar in layers from the bottom up, until the tops of the stones are an inch or so below the top of the firebricks: First, bed all of the stones in a good bed of mortar and fill the inner surfaces as you go. However, don't fuss with the outer exposed surface yet. Keep the mortar about 1" in from the final outer layer. Cut and interweave the wire mesh into the mortar and stones as you go.</p><p>• After the stones and inner layers of mortar are in place, keep the structure wet for 48 hours using the burlap bags.</p><p>• To fill the final outer layer between the stones, use a grout bag and a thin mixture of grout (a little water goes a long way). The grout bag is nothing more than a large cake-decorating bag and is used in a similar way. Just cut a hole the diameter of a standard pencil in the bottom of the bag and fill in the gaps a layer at a time.</p><p>• Be sure to keep the cavity you're working on wet (a spray bottle is handy for this). After you fill a cavity, wait about 30 minutes, then smooth and blend the grout into the stone and mortar patches using a damp 1 1/2" paintbrush. Try to keep mortar and mortar water off the surfaces of the stones that will be exposed or the stones will have a dull-gray appearance.</p><p>• Work all of the outer layer of grout up to within 1" of the top.</p><h3>STEP 5: THE TOP</h3><p>• The top can be any material you choose: flagstone, marble, granite, ceramic floor tiles or just plain leveled concrete. Whatever you choose, make sure it is flat and level.</p><p>• Wet down the top of the structure and add a layer of mortar. Lay the top after wetting it. Continue until complete, leveling as you go.</p><p>• When you're finished, seal all mortar and cement with a waterproofing masonry sealer.</p><p>• Wet-bag it for 48 hours.</p><p>• Install grill unit.</p>
