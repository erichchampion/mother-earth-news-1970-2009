                          <p>      Don't try to tell Dinh Khanh that solar water heaters have      to be complicated or expensive. Khanh-a resident of      Gainesville, Florida designed and built the compact (26" X      42" X 52"), low-cost ($180), sun-powered water-warmer shown      at left . . . and it's about as <em>un</em> complicated a      device as you could hope to find.    </p>    <p>      Basically, Khanh's heater is nothing more than a      flat-black-painted 66-gallon water tank enclosed in an      insulated pyramidal framework consisting of 1" plywood,      Plexiglas outer glazing, and a Tedlar inner glazing.      (Behind the tank is a 42" X 52" reflector surface made from      recycled aluminum printing plates.)    </p>    <p>      What Khanh has done is (1) lean this odd-shaped solar      collector against the south side of his house at a 45°      angle (to take maximum advantage of the low winter sun),      (2) run cold water into the <em>bottom</em> of the      66-gallon tank, and (3) route CPVC pipe from the top of the      solar unit to a conventional water heater inside the Khanh      dwelling. This way, incoming water is <em>pre-warmed</em>      by the solar collector to a temperature of about 100° F      before entering the house's conventional electric heater .      . . and the Khanh family enjoys a 50% savings on their      monthly hot water bills.    </p>    <p>      Dinh sees no reason why others can't build their own      semi-triangular solar water heaters (and enjoy similar      savings), as long as certain rules are followed during      construction. For instance: "It's important," says Khanh,      "that all angles and proportions be kept the same as in the      original design, and that the tank is mounted at least four      inches away from the underlying reflector. Also-to      maintain the best balance between high energy absorbance      during the day and low heat loss at night-the builder      should only use a 16- to 18-inch-diameter water tank of 42      to 66 gallons' capacity." (The Vietnamese born inventor      emphasizes, too, that the tank should be leak-free, able to      withstand 75-psi pressure, and either galvanized or      glass-lined.)    </p>    <p>      At 400-plus pounds all-up weight, the Khanh heater isn't      exactly feather-light. ("Be sure to take this into      account," the inventor warns, "if you plan to install the      device on your roof!") The dandy little solar hot box,      however, is one heck of an inexpensive, compact,      easy-to-build "answer" to high water heating bills. In      fact, if there's a better way to turn 66 gallons of cold      water into 66 gallons of hot water . . . we haven't seen      it!    </p>
