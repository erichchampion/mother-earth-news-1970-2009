        <p><strong>Copthorne Macdonald is the inventor of slow-scan television and is an authority on other forms of personally controlled (amateur or "ham") radio communication.</strong></p><h2 id="subtitle">CB UPDATE</h2><p>A lot's happened on the Citizens' Band (CB) radio scene since we took our first look at CB back in MOTHER NO. 35 (pages 66-68), and it now seems about time for an update.</p><p>No doubt the most important development in the field during the past two years has been the explosive growth in CB's popularity. Statistics abound on this subject, but one set of numbers I came across not long ago really stuck in my mind: In the U.S. as a whole, one of every eleven families owns a CB radio . . . while among <em>farm</em> families, <em>one in six</em> has a set. It's easy to imagine why this form of two-way communication has caught on so well among rural folks: In the back country, CB radio can serve as an area-wide "party line" for the exchange of recipes, gossip, and other information . . . it can serve as a way to alert the crew back in the woods that dinner is ready . . . or it can be a vital communications link in times of emergency. CB radio's versatility makes it a "natural" for homesteaders (and others) who may live miles from the nearest neighbors, stores, medical help, etc.</p><p>Perhaps you've thought of getting started in CB radio yourself. If so, you should know-first of all-that CB is strictly a <em>short-range</em> (up to 20 miles or so) radio communications system designed for personal or institutional use. You should also know that before you can operate your CB station (or <em>any</em> radio station, for that matter), you must obtain a license from the Federal Communications Commission. Fortunately, this isn't difficult to do, because-in contrast to the procedure for obtaining an amateur radio operator's license-you're <em>not</em> required to take a test in Morse code or radio theory in order to receive your CB station license. All you have to do is fill out FCC Form 505 ("Application for a Class C or D Station License in the Citizen's Radio Service") and send it in to the Federal Communications Commission, Box 1010, Gettysburg, Pa. 17325. (It used to be that you had to include a one-time $4.00 fee with your application, but-as of January 1, 1977-this requirement was dropped.)</p><p>In addition to filing Form 505 with the FCC, you must-before you can legally go on the air-order (or already have on hand) Part 95 of the FCC's rules governing the use of CB radio. You don't have to read the rules . . . you just have to have them in your possession. (To obtain Part 95, send $1.50 to the Superintendent of Documents, U.S. Government Printing Office, Washington, D.C. 20402. Specify Stock Number 004-000-003241.)</p><p>Thanks to a recent improvement in the licensing procedure, it's no longer necessary to wait an interminable two to three months for your permanent license to arrive before you can begin "modulating". Nowadays, you can write out your own Temporary Permit (on FCC Form 555-B) at the same time you fill out your license application (Form 505) and begin transmitting immediately. (Note: The Temporary Permit is, unfortunately, good for only 60 days.)</p><p>Frequently, Forms 505 and 555-B are packed right in the box with new CB equipment or can be obtained from CB dealers. If you can't locate these forms yourself, though, you can always get them by mail from the FCC, Citizen's Radio Division, Washington, D.C.20054.</p><p>In Canada, licensing requirements aren't quite as liberal as they are in the U.S.: Canadian citizens can't legally buy a transmitter until they've obtained a station license. Thus, a Canadian CB enthusiast's first step is to contact an office of the Department of Communications. (Regional Offices are located in Vancouver, Winnipeg, Toronto, Montreal, and Moncton.)</p><p>As you may already know, the FCC (and the DOC) recently upped the number of available CB channels from 23 to 40. This will undoubtedly have a beneficial effect in urban and suburban areas, where channel overcrowding has been a nightmare for some time. As a side benefit, we can expect to see an increase in the number of 23-channel sets on the used market as people trade their old rigs in for the newer 40-channel units.</p><p>The newsstands, of course, are chock-full of CB books and magazines these days. (With more than 16 million CBers now on the air, the market for CB publications is-to say the least-huge.) Out of all the dozens of manuals on the stands, however, the absolute bar-none best book on the subject-I think-has to be <em>The Big Dummy's Guide to C.B. Radio,</em> a 128-page labor of love created by our good friends, the radio crew at The Farm in Tennessee.</p><p>The Guide is a thoughtfully organized, funny, and-above all-truly informative handbook . . as well it should be, because the folks at The Farm really <em>use</em> CB: the midwives, the paramedics, the band, the farming and construction crews, everyone. Happily, this firsthand knowledge has led to the creation of a book that answers all the right questions . . . the questions beginners really want answered. The <em>Guide</em> shows you, for instance, how to install a CB radio in your car . . . how to rig a homemade antenna for your base station . . . how to troubleshoot an ailing transmitter . . . and much more. (There's also a glossary of CB lingo, or "channel jive", as the authors call it.)</p><p>So far, more than a quarter million copies of <em>The Big Dummy's Guide to C.B. Radio</em> have been sold. Buy a copy for yourself and you'll see why the book's so popular. (If you can't find it at the local newsstand or bookstore, you can order the Guide by mail for $2.95-plus 50d postage-from The Book Publishing Company, Summertown, Tenn. 38483, or from Mother's Bookshelf.)</p><p>We'll have more about The Farm's radio activities in future issues.</p><h3>A REMINDER</h3><p>A current schedule of on-the-air NDR activities can be found in the latest <em>New Directions Roundtable Newsletter</em>, published bi-monthly by Randy Brink (WA7BKR) and "Bo" Bogardus (W6HSE). To get on the mailing list, send 13 cents stamps-one for each issue of the newsletter you'd like to receive-to Randy at Rt. 2, Box 3018, Port Orchard, Wash. 98366. (And-since Randy and Bo only publish the newsletter as a service-you might also send along a small donation.)</p><p>Peace,<br />Cop Macdonald (VE1BFL)<br />99 Fitzroy St.<br />Charlottetown<br />Prince Edward Island<br />Canada C1A 1R6s</p>
