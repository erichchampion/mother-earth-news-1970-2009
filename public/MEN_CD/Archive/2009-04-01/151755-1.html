        <p>The first thing you do when preparing to cut a board is to make a mark for the cut. About 90 percent of the carpenters I know make a mark with a speed square and cut on the left of the line sometimes and to the right of the line other times. Who knows?</p>The small straight mark on the right is the exact place you want the blade to cut and is the correct way to mark a board, the wing mark on the left of the small mark is the waste side.
