        <p><strong>1.</strong> Pick your favorite plants: If you don’t really like cabbage, don’t bother to grow it!</p><p><strong>2.</strong> Balance delayed gratification with instant satisfaction: Buy some plants already about to flower and sow seeds around them. Buy some slow-growing perennials, but add annuals for quick, same-season color.</p><p><strong>3.</strong> Don’t work harder than you have to. Why kill yourself digging rocky soil when you can import dirt and make a raised bed?</p><p><strong>4.</strong> Ask around or barter for materials. We traded with our neighbors for wooden fish crates and bait barrels, which make fine planters and storage containers.</p><p><strong>5.</strong> Get a wheelbarrow. This was our best garden purchase of the year, saving us hours of heavy carrying.</p><p><strong>6.</strong> Collect manure, well-rotted compost, leaves and seaweed to build your humus. Great soil maximizes your chances of having great plants.</p><p><strong>7.</strong> Plant too much rather than too little. Widely spaced plants in empty beds look sad, encourage weeds and need more watering. Fill up those beds!</p><p><strong>8.</strong> Start seeds indoors to save money.</p><p><strong>9.</strong> Get plants from friends, but make sure they’re healthy before bringing them home. Make sure they don’t include invasive weeds.</p><h5>Lori Covington<br />Mill Village, Nova Scotia</h5>
