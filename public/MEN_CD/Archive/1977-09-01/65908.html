                    <hr />    <p>      Skidding needn't be an aggravating taskfor you or your      animal-if you'll take the time to follow a few simple      rules.    </p>    <p>      First and foremost, learn to communicate with your mule,      horse, jackass, or whatever . . . then be consistent in      your demands and expectations so that the animal in turn      can develop consistent responses. If you fight or argue      with your beast, the end result will be frustration (for      both of you). Jude and I learned together, since we were      both beginners. I lectured her sternly a few timesand she      treated me rather roughly on a few occasions-but we did      ultimately begin to understand each other and work      together.    </p>    <p>      Secondly, never force your animal to pull a load that's      beyond its capability. This is the one thing that will      force your beast to quit (maybe for good) before anything      else. (If you've ever pulled an oak log very far, you can      understand the problem . . . and you can see why it's good      to have a spirited beast!)    </p>    <p>      If your animal doesn't want to pull, find out why . . .      because something is wrong. Check the collar and harness.      Are there sores anywhere (on the animal's shoulders, for      instance) that might indicate rubbing or an improper fit:'    </p>    <p>      When you attach the chain to the log, wrap it around the      log once and then hook it to itself. This way, it'll pull      tight or "choke" the big timber as the beast steps out. On      a short or lightweight log, choke the small end and let the      butt drag. If the log is exceedingly long or heavy, it's      best to attach the chain to the butt and let the small end      trail.    </p>    <p>      For safety's sake, always stand uphill or to one side of      the log to avoid having the timber smash into you. (This is      a sound practice both when you choke the log and when      you're bringing your beast toward the landing.) If you're      caught standing between the log and the animal as the      animal steps out, you're likely to spend the rest of the      day nursing a sore shin or ankle. Remember: Be alert to      dangerous situations at all times. Use your head. Think!    </p>    <p>      Also, whenever you're going uphill (or undertaking a heavy      pull) give ole Jude a rest as often as she needs one . . .      she won't hesitate to let you know when (by stopping). Nor      will she hesitate to begin pulling again after she's caught      her breath. (To simplify matters, Cheryl and I felled most      of our trees in the area of forest above the cabin site so      that we could transport our logs downhill. We recommend      that you do likewise.)    </p>    <p>      The key-remember-is teamwork. Get to know your animal . . .      be patient with him/her . . . and together, the two of you      will be able to accomplish some truly creditable feats.      Jude and I managed several times to move 20- and      26foot-long oak logs (weighing hundreds of pounds) to the      construction site, and we felt right proud of ourselves      afterwards.
