        <p class="caption">In this graywater system, wastewater from the drains shown in brown flows through a filtration and pumping system in the basement to landscape plants outside. Graywater systems can be designed to recycle most household wastewater, with the exception of blackwater from toilets, which must flow to a sewer system or septic field.</p>
