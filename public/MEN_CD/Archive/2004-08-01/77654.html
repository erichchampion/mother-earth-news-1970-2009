                    <p>      <strong>for where you live Edited by Carol      Mack</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>New England/Maritime Canada</strong>    </p>    <p>      Early August is an optimal time to start fall crops of      spinach, lettuce and other short-season greens. Prepare the      garlic patch ahead of time by turning in compost and      well-rotted manure. Azomite, a trace mineral supplement,      has been key in helping to increase the size of my garlic      heads. Spacing the plants from 10 to 12 inches apart helps,      too. Mulch new ground with cardboard and cover that with      straw, hay or grass clippings for neatness and to hold the      cardboard down. By spring, the sod will be dead, the      cardboard and mulch broken down, and the ground will be      ready for tilling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong>    </p>    <p>      This is your last chance to put in those frost-sensitive      plants such as beans, cucumbers and summer squash that      mature in less than 60 days. Sow cool- weather crops like      beets, carrots, radishes and hardy greens in two-week      successions. After plants develop the third set of true      leaves, try undersowing with white Dutch clover to suppress      weeds, attract beneficial insects, fix nitrogen and live on      as a winter/spring cover crop. Try plant-<br />      ing perennial onions this fall - yellow potato onions      yield heavily in this region. If you are saving your own      garlic, pick medium to large heads that are tightly formed      for replanting, and just enjoy eating the largest bulbs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Interior</strong>    </p>    <p>      Yes, it is steamy hot outside, but fall gardening in the      Southern Interior is some of the best gardening of the      year. In August, sow Brussels sprouts, which are best grown      as a fall crop, as well as cabbage, broccoli, kohlrabi and      carrots. Keep them well watered, and mulch them to conserve      moisture and keep the soil cool. They tolerate a good deal      of frost, which actually will improve their flavor. By      September, the weather has cooled considerably - just      in time for another round of planting. Mustard greens, easy      to grow and very nutritious, can be sown in beds or rows.      In Zone 8 or warmer, turnips can be grown from early fall      into early spring. Beets and garden peas are also fine      candidates to round out the garden.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gulf Coast</strong>    </p>    <p>      Prune the best peppers and eggplants back a bit, and mulch,      water and fertilize them to encourage a fall crop. The rest      of the garden can be tilled several times, or solarized, to      dry out the soil and reduce nematode populations.      Solarization also requires tilling, but you want the soil      to be moist before covering it with a layer of UV-resistant      clear plastic; in six to eight weeks, most of the weeds and      other pests will be reduced. Also, seed snow peas now and      bush beans through early September. Be sure to keep them      watered and covered with fabric row covers until the heat      gives way to cooler temperatures.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Central/Midwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Reaping the rewards of the season sometimes seems like an      endless job! Try to pick produce in the morning after the      heavy dew is gone and again in late afternoon. To spread      out tasks such as making spaghetti sauce, freeze key      ingredients now and make the sauce on a cool fall day.      Extend the harvest season by plant-ing cool-weather      varieties such as lettuce, peas and greens. Be vigilant in      watching insect populations; squash bugs multiplied      particularly rapidly last year and ate our winter squash      crop!    </p>    <p>      <strong>North Central and Rockies</strong>    </p>    <p>      Late summer is fire season in much of our area, so      preventative and protective measures are in order. Make      sure your roofs are clean, and rake dry plant materials      away from siding, fences and decks. Even city dwellers need      to maintain a 30-foot fire-resistant landscape around      buildings. Firebrands can be carried a half mile or more by      winds accompanying forest fires and can easily ignite dry      foundation plantings. Farther from the house, expect a      certain amount of brown in the landscape - summer      dormancy is nature’s way of surviving this droughty      time of year. Mulches and drip irrigation will make every      drop of water count in both landscape and garden. Sow hardy      greens through August. And remember to take a shaker of      garlic-basil salt with you to the tomato patch - the      big pay-off for all that work is a juicy bite of      just-picked, sun-warmed, vine-ripened tomato with just a      touch of the salt.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Northwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      There’s a sense of joy and satisfaction as we get      caught up in the flurry of late summer harvest. If you have      more than you can use, contribute to your local food      pantry. Start transplants or direct sow cold-hardy onions      such as ‘Walla Walla Sweets’ by early August,      but wait until late September to plant garlic. September      conditions are excellent for planting and transplanting      perennial herbs. For salad treats this fall and next      spring, plant successions of cold-hardy European greens      (corn salad/mache, chicories, kale) and Asia mustards and      Joi Choi. Fall beets should be in the ground by early      August.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Enjoy the Southwest chile season, stringing red chiles into      ristras, and roasting and freezing green chiles for next      winter’s stews. Keep sowing fall greens, including      spinach, kale and lettuce through August at higher      elevations and September at lower levels. Sow fava beans in      September in areas where winter temperatures don’t      drop below 20 degrees - they will make a tasty spring      treat. Clean up and compost crops that are finished or that      get hit by frost. Then, plant the ground to fall cover      crops. Winter rye or winter triticale mixed with vetch or      peas work well at both high and low elevations. Mulch      perennials with straw or bark chips in colder regions to      increase winter hardiness. Share extra produce with      neighbors, schools or a shelter.    </p>
