        <p class="caption">Our earliest-planted potatoes grow such vigorous vines that — by midsummer—the patch looks like a jungle as the foliage spreads to meet between the rows. We know, however, that this natural shade-mulch conserves moisture, cools the earth and prevents drying and cracking. Later plantings do not grow quite so luxuriantly and we cover the ground around them with grass cuttings, leaves and corn stalks. Both early and late plantings mature with only the moisture from spring rains, we use no irrigation. Nor do we use fertilizer or pesticides. We just till under organic matter and "hand-pick" the few potato bugs we find. Primitive methods, but first-rate potatoes!</p>
