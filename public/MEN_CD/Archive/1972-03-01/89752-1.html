        <p class="caption">Above: About six strokes to a side from the back toward the edge of the razor should sharpen it. Keep thumb of hand holding stone down. Left: Razor and stone. I bought the stone from a barber for a buck. Its missing corner does not affect its performance. Middle: Cup and brush. Any cup will do but a badger hair brush (find one second-hand) is best of all. Right: Wet the brush in hot water and swish it around in the cup until you get this. You needn't do your whole face at once as the lather will sometimes dry out before you. get to it.</p>
