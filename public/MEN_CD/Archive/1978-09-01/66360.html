                <h5 id="byline">      by Leland S. Devore    </h5>    <p>      HELP! The good folks at the Brooks Bird Club are buried up      to their necks in mail... and only you can dig them out!    </p>        <p>      <em>Yes, you can still create your own personal wildlife      sanctuary!</em>    </p>    <p>      If you read MOTHER NO. 51 (page 24), you know about the      worthy work being done by the Brooks Bird Club in Wheeling,      West Virginia. And if you didn't read that issue of MOTHER,      you should know that the good folks at the organization      have come up with one of the slickest and easiest ways      imaginable for turning your property (farm, woodlot, even      back yard) into a personal wildlife sanctuary. In short:    </p>    <p>      Thanks to the work of the Brooks Bird Club, all you have to      do to register any piece of land as a wildlife sanctuary is      sign a pledge that you'II manage the property-no      matter how big or small (the tiniest so far is a 30 X      100-foot lot in New York City and the largest encompasses      2,200 acres in Virginia)-in a manner that protects      and improves its natural flora and fauna.    </p>    <p>      That's it. And the signing of the statement in no way      compromises your ownership or personal rights to your land.      All -I repeat-all it does is put you on record      as being a concerned property owner who is dedicated to the      preservation of your land's native flora and fauna.    </p>    <p>      That simple act (the signing of the pledge), however, can      have a great deal of value to you. Because it registers      your property with the 45-year-old, non-profit,      internationally active Brooks Bird Club and entitles you to      assistance with any environmental problems or questions you      may have. (Typical queried that the sponsoring organization      has answered: How can I improve my land's habitat for      squirrels and rabbits? What trees should we plant to      provide food and shelter for birds?)    </p>    <p>      In addition, for a very small fee (the only expense you'll      incur in the whole program), you'll be furnished with as      many attractive metal signs stating that your property is a      registered wildlife sanctuary as you want. Just send $1.25      for each placard plus $1.00 postage for one, $1.25 for two,      and $1.75 for three to five signs (please allow six to      eight weeks for delivery).    </p>    <p>      At no time will you receive a dun for registration fees,      hidden costs of any kind, reports to fill out, legal      commitments of any nature, or any other obligation to do      anything. This is an entirely voluntary, do-ityourself      environmental program. You're always completely free to      oversee and manage your personal sanctuary in the way that      you think best. And if, for any reason, you ever decide you      want out of the whole operation . . . no problem. Simply      take down your signs. It's that easy.    </p>    <p>      As I mentioned in my article in MOTHER NO. 51, I've had my      small acreage registered for about three and a half years      now, and I've enjoyed every minute of it. During that time      I've improved the place's habitat for small mammals by      building a couple of large brush piles and planting native      food plants. I've also improved the property for me (and me      for it!) by cultivating native wildflowers and becoming far      more aware of the wildlife around me.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, I've been highly pleased by the effectiveness      of the "wildlife sanctuary" signs posted along my land's      borders. On the one hand, they've materially reduced the      trespassing that "no hunting" and "no trespassing" signs      seemed unable to stop. And on the other, they've attracted      interested (and interesting!) people who've looked me up to      learn more about "what's going on". (I've become something      of a local wildlife "expert" to these folks, thanks to the      bird identification information I've received from the      organization that sponsors sanctuaries like mine.)    </p>    <p>      This whole grand program, in short, is a lot of fun and      very worthwhile. It has given me a good, warm, solid      feeling to know that I'm actually doing something      constructive to preserve the natural environment ...      instead of just sitting around, wringing my hands, and      hoping that things get better. I also enjoy knowing that my      little piece of land is part of something much bigger (well      over 16,000 acres now) which is devoted to reversing the      degradation of our beautiful planet.    </p>    <p>      And that's why I wrote the article extolling the Brooks      Bird Club and its program for MOTHER NO. 51. I just wanted      to let all of MOTHER's other readers in on the Good Thing      I've found. And, unfortunately-in my original      piece-I told you that the club's wildlife sanctuary      program information packet was free.    </p>    <p>      I say "unfortunately" because never-in the whole      45-year history of the Brooks Bird Club-has the      organization received the response that my article in      MOTHER generated! Three weeks after MOTHER NO. 51 went on      sale, the group was already swamped by over 1,000 letters.      A week and a half after that, the count was up to more than      2,300 responses. And I'm afraid to even call and ask the      harried folks at the club how many pieces of mail they've      received to date!    </p>    <p>      What this boils down to is that the Brooks Bird Club is an      absolutely first-rate and dedicated organization. But it's      small, its members are all volunteers, and it is a      completely non-profit operation ... that never-in its      wildest dreams-expected the avalanche of mail that      MOTHER's article has generated. And that avalanche, plus      the recent increases in the cost of postage and other      materials that the club uses in its program, now threatens      to put an end to any further expansion of the Wildlife      Sanctuary idea . . . unless you extend a very small (but      very important) helping hand to the Brooks Bird Club. Here      are the new ground rules:    </p>    <p>      [1] All the kind folks who wrote to the club as a result of      my original article and who included a stamped,      self-addressed long envelope or a donation for their reply      ... have already received (or will soon receive) the      requested information.    </p>    <p>      [2] If, however, you wrote to the club and did not include      a stamped, self-addressed long envelope or a donation . . .      you did not (and will not ) receive the information you      requested. The Brooks Bird Club-through no fault of      its own (it's my fault . . . I wrote the      article!)-simply does not have the resources to      handle that many free requests. But you still can get the      information you wanted: Just write again . . . only this      time, enclose a stamped, self-addressed long envelope      and/or a donation of a dollar or two to cover the cost of      sending you the material.    </p>    <p>      [3] If you haven't written to the club at all . . . do so!      There's still plenty of time to get in on this magnificent      Wildlife Sanctuary program. So write and ask for details      but do enclose a stamped, self-addressed long envelope      and/or a donation of at least one dollar (and as much more      as you can spare).    </p>    <p>      Thank you so much for your consideration in this matter.      The Brooks Bird Club, 707 Warwood Avenue, Wheeling, West      Virginia 26003 is made up of some of the nicest and most      dedicated people you'll ever meet anywhere, the group's      Wildlife Sanctuary program is simply one of the best      conservation and ecology efforts that I've ever run across.      . . and THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) does a far better job of      "getting the word out" than any publication that I've ever      worked with. I'm only sorry that these three pluses may      have added up-at least temporarily-to make you      wonder why you never received an answer to your query about      the club's wildlife program. Try again!    </p>
