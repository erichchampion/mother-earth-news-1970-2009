                    <h5 id="byline">      by Anne and Paul Ehrlich    </h5>        <p>      <br />      <em>Paul Ehrlich (Bing Professor of Population Studies and      Professor of Biological Sciences, Stanford University) and      Anne Ehrlich (Senior Research Associate, Department of      Biological Sciences, Stanford) are familiar names to      ecologists and environmentalists everywhere. As well they      should be. Because it was Paul and Anne who-through      their extensive writing and research-gave special      meaning to the words "population" "resources" and      "environment" in the latter part of the 1960's. (They also      coined the term</em> coevolution, <em>and did a lot to      make</em> ecology <em>the household word it is today.) But      while most folks are aware of the Ehrlichs' popular writing      in the areas of ecology and overpopulation (most of us for      instance-have read Paul's book</em> The Population      Bomb) . . . far <em>too few people have any idea of how      deeply the Ehrlichs are involved in ecological research      (research of the type that tends to be published only in      technical journals and college textbooks). That's why it      pleases us to be able to present-on a regular      basis-the following semi-technical column by      authors/ecologists/educators Anne and Paul Ehrlich.</em>    </p>    <h3>      HOPE FOR THE FORESTS?    </h3>    <p>      The accelerating destruction of the earth's tropical      forests is one of the saddest ecological events in the      history of our planet. There is some dispute as to just how      rapidly these areas are being cleared. But there is no      question that-if current trends continue-there      will soon (perhaps sometime between the years 2000 and      2050) be no tropical forests at all . . . except for a few      scattered reserves and small patches on hillsides too steep      to be put to any other use.    </p>    <p>      There are several reasons for the disappearance of these      forests. One factor, of course, is the rapid population      growth of the tropical countries. In many Latin American,      African, and Southeast Asian nations the population is      still increasing at a rate of two to three percent each      year. This figure implies that the human density in these      lands will double during the next 20 to 35 years. And it      seems only natural to suppose that those ever-increasing      numbers of people-very poor people at that-will      continue to cut their forests (one of the few readily      available resources at their disposal) at an everincreasing      rate to supply themselves with firewood, building      materials, and subsistence farm plots.    </p>    <p>      In most places, however, it is not population pressure per      se that is directly responsible for the destruction of      tropical woodlands . . . it is the opening up of new areas      for economic reasons. University of Michigan political      scientist Kathleen Foote Durham, for instance, has shown      that much of the deforestation in the Peruvian section of      the Amazon Basin has not been caused by invasions of      subsistence farmers from the "overcrowded" highlands.      Instead, large and small "cash-cropping" organizations are      behind most of this destruction. These cash-cropping      operations, supported in part by the Peruvian government,      are producing profitable exports as well as food and lumber      for the country's cities located west of the Andes.    </p>    <p>      In short, then, the forests of Peru-with the help of      cheap migrant labor from the highlands-are rapidly      being destroyed for the sake of a quick buck. And this is      happening while the population and economic pressures on      those highlands could be greatly diminished in a far more      environmentally sound manner merely by raising the      abysmally low yields of native domestic crops (such as the      potato). Peruvian government policies to date, however,      have consistently favored the colonization of lowland      forests over programs designed to improve highland      agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps an even more dramatic example of the destruction of      tropical forests, though, is occurring now in the Amazon      Basin of Peru's neighbor to the east, Brazil. This      five-millionkilometer (two-million-square-mile) area is      being deliberately cleared by the government-over the      protests of ecologists in Brazil and elsewhere-in the      interests of mineral exploitation, cattle raising, and      large cash-crop operations.    </p>    <p>      For a short time during the early 1970's this development      of Amazonia (and especially the Trans-Amazon Highway) was      given much publicity as a program designed to provide      farmland for people from the overpopulated and ecologically      ravaged northeastern part of Brazil. More recently,      however, even that facade has been dropped.    </p>    <p>      In 1974, to be specific, President Geisel of Brazil      announced a new program for the economic development of      Amazonia . . . which would concentrate upon the      aforementioned mining, lumbering, and cattle-raising      operations. Thus, instead of the small-farmoriented      peasants from the northeast, the Amazon "pioneers" are now      to be modeled after the legendary American billionaire,      Daniel Ludwig. (Ludwig's Jari Forestry and Ranching Company      covers 12,000 square kilometers and has already cleared      about 1,000 square kilometers of Amazonian forest.) The      rapid multiplication of such operations throughout much of      the Tropics would seem to doom the rain forests . . . and      their native human and nonhuman inhabitants.    </p>    <p>      And why should we care if the tropical forests of the      planet are destroyed? Few North Americans have ever seen      such a forest, and fewer still would be likely to enjoy a      sojourn in one. Unfortunately, however, the lives of future      generations in North America will be influenced by the fate      of these South American "jungles".    </p>    <p>      First of all, tropical forests are vital to the proper      functioning of the planet's larger ecological system. They      influence both the balance of carbon dioxide in the      atmosphere and the reflectivity of the earth's surface      (both factors play important roles in the governing of the      planet's climate.    </p>    <p>      The forests also have the potential-if current "get      it while you can" lumbering practices are changed-of      yielding a sustainable harvest of high quality woods (such      as teak and mahogany) which may be very difficult to      substitute for in the future.    </p>    <p>      And, above all, the tropical "wildernesses" provide a vast      and irreplaceable reservoir of organic diversity . . . as      many millions of the species of plants and animals which      thrive in them can live nowhere else. In fact, plants      derived from such areas have already provided Homo sapiens      with a vast array of foods, spices, drugs, and other      valuable substances. (Prominent examples which immediately      come to mind include rice, rubber, quinine, belladonna,      bananas, jute, pineapples, cacao, rotenone, and cassava.)      Furthermore, the uses of a great many other tropical "gifts      of nature" are just now being explored and it would be      criminal to wipe them from the face of the earth before we      even understand their value.    </p>    <p>      It also should be noted that many animals of the tropical      forest, ranging from morpho butterflies to jaguars, have      direct commercial value and-as pollinators,      herbivores, etc.-are intimately involved in the      maintenance of a diversity of plants. As the Tropics are      mowed down, any future benefits that might be derived from      this vast storehouse of organic variety-of      course-will be sacrificed for all time.    </p>    <p>      Another great loss will be the reservoir of cultural      diversity represented by the rain forest peoples around the      world . . . such as the Malayan aborigines, the Philippine      Tasaday, and the Yanomamo of Brazil. There were 230      separate tribes of Brazilian Amerindians in 1900. By 1957,      the number had been reduced to 143. That's 87 distinct      human cultures lost in just one tropical country in a      little over half a century! The same attrition-often      deliberately accelerated by genocidal acts of governments      and individuals from the invading western      culture-continues today in Brazil and elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      All these losses are irreversible and something must be      done to save the tropical forests and their indigenous      cultures. Obviously, once all these unique populations and      species of organisms become extinct, the restoration of the      equatorial jungles will become impossible . . . and it will      never be possible to rebuild them, at least not with their      original biotic composition. Furthermore, the structure of      most tropical forests-especially the very wet rain      forests-makes them extremely vulnerable to      irreversible destruction . . . even if reservoirs of the      necessary species are somehow available to recreate the      land's original flora and fauna. And, of course, once a      culture is destroyed, there is absolutely no way it can be      brought back again.    </p>    <p>      Aside from the grounds of compassion and interest (which      should be enough), there are also practical reasons for      trying to preserve the cultural diversity that "progress"      is increasingly trampling underfoot. The      knowledge-for instance-which enables primitive      cultures to get along with nature, may prove invaluable to      a western society that has largely forgotten how. Who      knows, some "primitive" peoples may even be able to tell us      modern "civilized" folks how to get along with each other!    </p>    <p>      In order to understand the fragility of tropical forests we      should consider how they were once used by slash-and-burn      agriculturists. When the population densities of such      "farmers" were low, they could work a given area      indefinitely. First, a worker would clear a small plot of      ground before the rainy season began. Then, after the      debris had dried, he burned the plot. This fire created a      rich layer of ash and killed off many potential insect      pests. The nomadic farmer could then plant his crops      and-when the rains came-he would wield his      machete or hoe to fight back the weeds which sprang up to      compete with his garden.    </p>    <p>      It is worth noting that many slash-and-burn agriculturists      traditionally planted a variety of crops in each clearing.      Their small plots-in other words-resembled      miniature ecosystems . . . and thereby were less      susceptible to pests and diseases than modern mono-crops,      did not deplete the soil's nutrients a great deal, and      provided their growers with a varied diet.    </p>    <p>      After the harvest the farmer might move on, or he might      once again burn the dried debris in his clearing. If he      stayed, of course, there would be less material to fuel the      second burning . . . and thus less ash and a cooler fire.      The little plot of land would be left less fertile that it      had been the first time, and fewer of the pests on the bit      of earth would be killed. Each cycle, then, would produce a      less satisfactory crop . . . which would soon cause the man      to abandon the plot we've just described for another. In      atypical slash-and-burn society, the community (yes, some      still exist) is so small that fallow plots remain      uncultivated until the forest has completely reclaimed them      and the land is finally ready for another cycle of farming.    </p>    <p>      You will note that this sequence is very different from      that followed in farming a small piece of land in, say,      Iowa. The original grassland ecosystem of the North      American plains has created a very deep nutrient-rich soil      that can be exploited for many seasons. Iowa also has an      automatic pest-control mechanism called "winter".    </p>    <p>      But the tropical rain forest has little in common with the      American prairie. In a rain forest most of the nutrients      are not in the soil, but in the plants themselves. The      trees have very shallow, spreading root systems which      rapidly take up any nutrient released by the decay of      organic matter. When these trees are cut down and burned to      ashes, the nutrients in that ash are rapidly leached away      (as they would not be from a more complex prairie soil      exposed to the rain).    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, a small clearing in a tropical rain forest is      easily recaptured by native vegetation. The surrounding      forest wall helps protect the thin soil from torrential      rains and baking tropical sun, and many of the leached      nutrients are taken up by nearby trees whose roots extend      into the clearing. The larger the clearing, though, the      more difficult this natural process of reforestation      becomes.    </p>    <p>      It follows, then, that when populations of slash-and-burn      farmers grow too large, and have to extend the sizes of      their clearings to compensate for the poorly "rested" soil      in each patch of land, they begin a trend which is nearly      impossible to reverse. The larger clearings expose more and      more soil to the deleterious effects of the sun and rain.      Which, of course, depletes the soil further and makes it      even more difficult for the native vegetation to move back      in and reclaim the damaged earth. The entire system runs      ever more rapidly downhill, to the disadvantage of both the      forest and the people living there. Some people believe      that the collapse of the Mayan civilization was caused, in      part, by overpopulation . . . which led to overintensive      slash-and-burn agriculture.    </p>    <p>      The classic slash-and-burn system-while still alive      in some regions-is, of course, rapidly disappearing .      . . in favor of something much worse. For when forests are      cleared wholesale to make way for conventional      agriculture-as is common in the Tropics      today-the earth is destroyed all the more rapidly.      Some tropical soils even turn into a hard, bricklike      substance that can never be farmed again (this process is      called "laterization").    </p>    <p>      The removal of forests can drastically alter a local      climate, too . . . turning an area where rich growth once      flourished into a semi-desert that is subject to      alternating floods and droughts (Brazil's northeast is a      case in point).    </p>    <p>      And, as if all that weren't bad enough, the destruction of      vast areas of rain forest (as is occurring in the Amazon      Basin) has the potential of altering the climate on a      global scale by, among other things, changing the carbon      dioxide balance in the atmosphere. Such changes can have      dramatic and direct effects . . . even on those of us who      live far from the equator.    </p>    <p>      In this dark and dismal picture of the Tropics that we've      just outlined we can see only one ray of light (there are,      no doubt, others) . . . and that is the country of Costa      Rica. A decade or two ago this small nation, like other      Central American countries, had-thanks to public      health measures begun in the 1930's-an extremely high      birth rate and a low death rate. By 1965, in fact, Costa      Rica's population was growing fast enough to double in just      18 years! But Costa Rica, unlike its neighbors, then      instituted a program that has reduced its birth rate from      49 per thousand (in the early 60's) to 28 per thousand (in      1977) . . . and that birth rate is still declining.    </p>    <p>      The key elements in this population control success seem to      have been the political stability engendered by Costa      Rica's democratic government, some fortunate historical      accidents, and welfare and reform policies which have      helped soften the impact of poverty.    </p>    <p>      For instance: Although Costa Rica has the economic      inequities which plague most less-developed countries, one      looks in vain in that nation for the makeshift shantytowns      that characteristically surround the cities in poorer      lands. Why? Partly because-for the past 30      years-the country has used its resources for      development instead of squandering them on a military      establishment. (A poor country with an expensive military      establishment makes as much sense as a poor family with a      pet elephant.)    </p>    <p>      Besides having taken steps to improve the lives of its      people, Costa Rica has worked toward the preservation of      its physical and biological endowment. Some 25% of the      small nation's land has been set aside in forest preserves      or national parks. (Contrast that with Brazil, where the      official goal is the setting aside of only 5% of its      forests . . . and in poorly planned preserves at that.)    </p>    <p>      Costa Rica also has an established institute which studies      tropical forest management and agricultural development.      This organization is experimenting with indigenous strains      of crops and seeks to discover new mixed-crop systems that      will be productive in the country's soils and climate. In      addition, the Costa Rican-based Organization of Tropical      Studies-which specializes in tropical      ecology-attracts students and scholars from the      United States and other countries. As a matter of fact, we      have studied under its auspices, and hope to do so again.    </p>    <p>      All this is not to say that Costa Rica has solved every one      of its problems. Even with reduced fertility, population      momentum guarantees that the country's present two million      citizens will at least double to four million shortly after      the turn of the century. Naturally, this population      increase may make the preservation of land and forest      resources difficult . . . even if the current policy of      clearing forests for cattle ranching can be contained and      the forest reserves protected.    </p>    <p>      Costa Rica, then, has made a good start at forest      conservation (a start that could be emulated profitably by      many countries, including the U.S.). Still, it will take      vigilance and dedication to avoid losing the gains that      this Central American nation has made in the past ten or      fifteen years. Furthermore, Costa Rica is only a minor      portion of the Tropics . . . a tiny country. Whether larger      nations-like Brazilcan be encouraged to reconsider      their      "rape-the-forests-for-profit-today-and-the-hell-with-tomorrow"      policies remains to be seen.    </p>    <p>      <em>For more details on tropical ecosystems see chapters 4 and      11 of Ecoscience: Population, Resources, Environment by      Paul R.
