    <p>
                    <p>      After a long, dusty day of working in the garden, about all      that most of us can think of is a good hot bath. "But      wait!" says Pat Mestern of Fergus, Ontario, Canada. "Raid      your herb border first . . . that is, if you want the most      refreshing and sensuous ablutions you've ever enjoyed.      Gather a goodly bunch of mint, or lemon balm, or fruit      sage, or chamomile. Tie the sprigs together (picking 'em at      least five inches long makes it easier) and toss the      aromatic bundle into your tub under the running water. A      marvelous aura of herbs will permeate the steam while you      soak and soap . . . especially if you use your bouquet      garni as a gentle sponge." It sounds downright habit      forming, Pat!    </p>    <p>      Last spring, when Paul Lish's pussycat had a "brief      encounter" with a skunk under the Lish trailer out in      Inkom, Idaho, Paul and his wife were literally "gassed" out      of house and home. Airing the place did precious little but      make it cold . . . and when they closed the doors and      windows again, the overpowering fragrance returned. Paul's      native American co-worker, however, had the remedy: Burn      cedar or juniper wood in the stove . . . with the damper      almost closed so the smoke would fill the house.    </p>    <p>      Mrs. Lish was skeptical about applying this piece of Indian      lore (she fretted over the likelihood of sooty ceilings and      drapes) .. but-as Paul pointed out-they had to      do something: They couldn't afford to trade in their home      on a new one, and they couldn't live in the place as long      as it smelled the way it did. So Paul and his wife      cedar-smoked that trailer-inside and      underside-and behold, the malodorous "eau de polecat"      was gone, leaving their dwelling only pleasantly redolent      of cedar . . . and with no blackened interior after all!    </p>    <p>      Would you believe that Vern Johnson of Bettendorf, Iowa has      discovered that his living room wall has 100% fewer      cavities after regular brushing with Crest! Vern says that      just about any kind of white toothpaste makes an excellent      spackling compound for patching small holes and cracks in      plaster walls. "It works very well," says Vern, "and it      dries surprisingly hard." Johnson adds that toothpaste      cures slower than commercial wall spackle, but this only      makes it easier to apply and smooth out. And sanding will      not be required at all if you blend the paste into the      plaster by rubbing the filler with a little water. This      "bathroom spackle" takes paint very well and can be cleaned      from tools and brushes quite easily with just a little      washing. Vern also reminds us about the old trick of using      toothpaste to shine rings and other delicate pieces of gold      jewelry.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, as long as you've got that tube of      denture-dazzler in hand, you might as well search around      and find that perfectly good watch with the badly scratched      crystal . . . or the favorite pair of sunglasses that you      just can't see through anymore. John Corbin of Sumter,      South Carolina recommends buffing the murky glass with a      high-abrasive toothpaste-or one of the newer tooth      polishes-to erase those troublesome scarifications.      One caution in working with watches, though: Be sure to      wipe off any excess completely if the timepiece ain't      waterproof!    </p>    <p>      And here's another unusual way to use commercial      dentifrice: Raylene Van Ness of Trout Creek, Montana puts      it on mosquito bites! "I dab some on ... and the itching      ceases immediately," she says. "The bumps will be gone by      the next day." (Now if we could just get the little      critters to brush before every meal, maybe they'd produce      itchless bites in the first place!)    </p>        <p>      Naturally, we'd all like to find a way to avoid those      bitingbug "blues in the night" in the first place. "You      don't have to drape a mosquito net over your bed or inhale      insect spray till the wee hours to get your beauty sleep,"      says Miami, Florida's Robert E. Moffett (and who should      know better than a Floridian?). "When you're fixin' to      retire for the night, simply turn off ail the lights in the      house . . . except for one in an open closet. All the      winged beasts in the vicinity will answer that hospitable      summons and-in 20 minutes or so-you'll be able to      turn off the beacon, shut the door on the pesky critters,      and hit the sack in peace."    </p>    <p>      What can you do if the yeast doesn't work in a batch of      bread? (It sure is discouraging when the dough just sits      there and won't rise.) Well, don't feed that sullen lump to      the pigs just yet. Do what Pat McGinnity of Midland,      Michigan does .. . make crackers! Here's how: Roil the      dough out as thin as you can and cut it into squares or      rectangles. Or use cookie cutters, plain or fancy (how      about animal shapes, just for fun?). Then spread the      cutouts apart on cookie pans . . . poke 'em several places      with a fork . .. sprinkle salt with a light hand ... and      bake the crackers in a 300Â°F oven till they just begin      to brown. Pat promises these snacks'll be "the best-tasting      mistakes you ever made!"    </p>    <p>      It's harvest time! Got a bumper crop of onions? Here's the      system Mrs. Richard Bosart uses down in Leander, Texas to      keep the vegetables in season-without tears and      without spoilage loss-all year round. She minces the      savory bulbs in her blender and fills ice cube trays with      the juicy bits. Then, when they've frozen solid, she pops      the cubes out and stores 'em in her freezer in plastic bags      . . . ready any time-in any amount-for soup,      meat loaf, or any other dish that calls for chopped onions.      And, she gets the blenderdeodorizing and the eye-wiping all      out of the way at one time.    </p>    <p>      Puttin' up a good bean harvest may not bring tears to the      eyes, but it can present a different hazard all its own:      sore fingers from stripping out those pods. And that's why      Laurence Brewer uses a wringer washer up in Candor, New      York to make bean shelling almost a pleasure instead of      surely a pain. According to Larry, once you have a      cardboard or plywood "backstop" set up in the tub opposite      the wringer, you can just feed those long legumes into the      rollers (keep fingers out, o'course, or your pinkies'll      hurt even worse than they did when you shelled by hand!),      and your beans will rattle into the tub like hail. Bet the      kids'll like watchin' these carryin'-ons better'n      television! Maybe your small fry will even crank the      contraption for you, if you can only find a hand-operated      wringer.    </p>    <p>      Rumor has it that more dental floss is used per capita in      Alaska than in any other state in the Union. Lolly Medley      is not surprised by that statistic. Because-away up      there in Wasilla, Alaska-she's discovered at least      some of the material's convenience and versatility. First      and foremost, she points out, waxed dental floss is both      the stoutest and most waterproof thread you can use for      hand sewing and mending (just don't forget that WAXED is      the operative word here). "I first used the treated floss      for sewing up mukluks and dog collars," says Lolly, "then      for all my mending ... even for stitching up wounds on      people and dogs when we couldn't get to a doctor."    </p>    <p>      Now most of us don't need to be our own moccasin makers or      malamute medics ... but how about anchorin' buttons on      jeans? Or closin' garment gaps of all kinds? What's more,      Lolly sticks a needle or two inside a packet of the      mechanical tooth cleaner, slips the packet !n her pocket .      . . and there's her portable repair kit for field or      stream! And speakin' of streams ... the bicuspids' best      friend will even double as fishin' line in a pinch!    </p>    <p>      Potty train your dairy critters? Maybe not. But you can      barn-break 'em. Edna Ryneveld reports that the dairy      farmers out around Humansville, Missouri start bringing      their heifers Into the barn at milking time about two      months before they're due to freshen. The animals are put      In unlocked stanchions and given some grain to munch ... a      treat both old and young cattle dearly love. (Wouldn't you      ... If you'd been eating grass all day?) But at the first      telltale, tailraisin' sign that the dairy debutantes are      about to mess up, the bamhands berate the beasts loudly and      shoo 'em out of the barn without letting' em finish their      business.    </p>    <p>      This bovine psychology works so well that manure shovelin'      is cut down to what seems to be the irreducible minimum.      And the heifers get a head start on bein' used to the      milking parlor noise and routine ... which makes the new      bossies more contented and easier to manage when their turn      to be milked does come later on.    </p>        <p>      Lots of folks have started converting those ubiquitous      plastic gallon jugs into scoops and feeders and water      carriers and whatnot . . . and here's a fine addition to      the list from Judy Ireton of New Carlisle, Ohio: Judy does      her laundry with a liquid, no-phosphate detergent that      comes packaged !n orangy-pink plastic bottles (a color that      glows better'n a raccoon's eyes when a car's headlights hit      it). So Ms. Ireton has filled several of the jugs with      sand-and a couple with water-and chucked 'em      into the trunk of the family car just so's she'll be ready      for several kinds of road emergencies. She now has sand to      help ease her vehicle's tires off of icy spots . . . water      to soothe a parched radiator . . . and reflecting warning      markers-weighted, so they'll stay in place-to      protect her if she has to stop her jalopy along the highway      after dark. Judy says, "You can see these signals a long      way off, they show up better than those triangle reflectors      you have to buy, and they sure last longer than a 10-minute      flare!"    </p>    <p>      You don't really have to drill, pound, punch, or even swear      much to get a broken-off handle out of your maul or      sledgehammer or axehead. Bill Gildon of Tonasket,      Washington just heats the tool-on his wood      stove-till It's a little hotter than he can hold      barehanded. The heat expands the metal so much that the      stubborn wooden plug will then almost always fall out after      only a light tap or two.    </p>    <p>      And then-once you've reequipped your axe with a good,      sturdy handle-you can prevent the replacement from      breaking again so easily the way Bill Morgan of Sewanee,      Tennessee does . . . by wrapping the four inches of wood      nearest the blade with any kind of fine wire (a smooth      electric fence strand works fine) that you have handy. To      keep the wrap in place, first drill a hole-big enough      for two strands of whatever wire you're using-clear      through the handle and about four inches back from the      head. Then pass one end of the wire through the hole and      leave an eight- or nine-inch "tall" on its end. The other      (long) end of the wire is next run up alongside the handle      to the head ... and then wound-close and      tight-back down to the hole. At that point, run the      second end of wire through the hole in the opposite      direction to the first, twist the two ends tightly      together, and clip off any excess tails. Bill says his      handles last 10 times longer this way.    </p>    <p>      Steve Morgan of Branson, Missouri-who says he's "gone      through years of playing the hermit" because of poison ivy,      even though he's tried all the medications on the markethas      finally found a sure-fire remedy for the pesky plague:      SALT. One good way to apply it, he says, is to work up a      good sweat (the briny perspiration will both soothe the      itch and start to dry the rash). And if your pores aren't      pumpin' hard enough on these cooler autumn days to do the      job? Then just wet the affected areas and sprinkle on a      little bit of good of table salt! Steve warns that this      treatment does bum and smart a bit, but it will make those      itching, weeping bumps go away ... and a salt shaker Is      cheaper'n drugstore potions.    </p>    <p>      For another persistent misery-athlete's      foot-you might want to try working in the garden . .      . barefoot. Steve shucked off his shoes while weeding, one      hot day, and found that his infested feet healed up fast.      He thinks the bacteria in the soil must've destroyed the      fungus!    </p>    <p>      Here's an old-timer's way to clean steel cutlery, from Teri      and Mike Anderson of Swan Lake, Montana. Crush a piece of      common brick with a hammer to make a pile of fine dust.      Then cut a potato In half, dip the cut surface in the      abrasive red powder, and simply scour away the rust and      stains.    </p>    <p>      OK. Now it's YOUR turn! We've all come up with some      practical, down-home, time-tested solutions to the      frustrating little problems that bug us every day. Let's      hear YOUR best "horse sense" ideas so we can share 'em and      all benefit    </p>    <p>      Send your pointers to Down-Home Country Lore, P.O. Box 70,      Hendersonville, North Carolina 28739, and I'll make sure      that the most useful of the suggestions will appear in      upcoming editions. A one-year subscription-or a      one-year extension of an existing subscription-will      then be sent to each contributor whose tip does get printed      in this column.-MOTHER.    </p>
