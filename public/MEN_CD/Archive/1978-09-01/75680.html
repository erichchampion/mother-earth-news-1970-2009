                    <p>      SMALL-HYDRO POWER IS ON THE WAY BACK.Many      of America's 50,000 dams once generated electricity, but      most were abandoned as energy producers during the heyday      of cheap fossil fuels. Now that oil prices are higher,      however, the small hydroelectric plants can, once again,      provide economical power. The U.S. Department of Energy has      received proposals to develop 50 separate plants of less      than fifteen megawatts, and hopes to have 1,500 Mw of this      "water power" in operation by 1985.<br />      <br />      A WOOD FURNACE FOR SMALL INDUSTRY has been      developed by Paul Kalenian of Massachusetts. The      heater-designed to use green and/or scrap      lumber-burns with an impressive 90% efficiency and      heats for half the cost of an equivalent oil-burner. Paul      is optimistic about his future. "After all," he says, "the      energy situation is only going to get worse."<br />      <br />      "ENERGY POLICY AS IF IT REALLY MATTERED ",      a new report from the Library of Congress' Congressional      Research Service, advocates extensive federal procurement      of alternative energy systems. The study states, for      instance, that the U.S. could save eight million barrels of      oil a year if half the federal motor-vehicle fleet      were composed of electric cars. Copies of this      report-which also calls for government purchases to      "enlarge and underwrite" the market for alternative energy      sources-are available from Rep. John Dingell, Washington,      D.C. 20515.<br />      <br />      AN ELECTRODELESS FLUORESCENT LIGHT BULB ,      developed by theoretical physicist Donald Hollister, can      produce nearly as much light as a standard 100-watt bulb .      . . and use only eighteen watts to do it! Hollister has      approached the major electrical equipment manufacturers      with his invention and found a marked lack of interest. The      physicist isn't surprised. "If I had a 'cash cow', I      wouldn't want it to go dry," he says.<br />      <br />      FINDING "FAULT" WITH NUCLEAR POWER. More      than twenty-four small earthquakes have occurred on a fault      line which runs within 3,000 feet of the three Indian Point      nuclear reactors near New York City. There is a 5% to 11%      possibility-according to a Columbia University report-that      a 'quake large enough to exceed the plants' design safety      limits will occur . . . sometime within the installations'      projected 40-year life span.<br />      <br />      A GOVERNMENT-SPONSORED SOLAR ENERGY      PROJECT will bring electricity to the Schuchuli      (Arizona) village of the Papago Indian tribe. The federally      funded power system will use photovoltaic (PV) sunlight      conversion to light the settlement's fifteen homes. Solar      power will also run the group's communal refrigerator,      wringer washer, and sewing machine. The entire energy      consumption of the "town" will be less than 75% of that      used by a typical U.S. urban family over the same      period.<br />      <br />      THE SAUDI ARABIAN OIL SQUEEZE WILL TIGHTEN ITS      GRIP in the 1980's, predicts U.S. Energy Secretary      James R. Schlesinger. World demand could reach 16 million      barrels a day by 1985 . . . but even the most optimistic      Saudi officials don't expect production to approach that      level. Arabian Finance Minister Mohamad Ali Abalkhail put      it this way: "Your shrinking dollar makes oil in the ground      look like a better investment than paper assets in the      bank."<br />      <br />      "SUNSHINE IS THE RESOURCE WE NEED TO      UTILIZE" says Public Service Company of New Mexico      (PNM) president Jerry Geist. His utility is the first in      the nation to press ahead with steam-generating solar      equipment. PNM is currently assessing solar technologies      under an $800,000 grant. This grant has brought criticism      to the company, notably from Patricia White of Energy      Consumers of New Mexico, Inc. Ms. White contends that such      grants should go to smaller individual operations, "So we      can get away from dependence on utilities."<br />      <br />      ALCOHOL AND GASOLINE DON'T MIX? George      Tsao, a Purdue University chemical engineering professor,      thinks that they can mix . . . and do so practically. Tsao      has developed a process to extract alcohol from grain and      crop residues . . . a technique that could make "gasohol"      commercially viable. Pilot programs in Nebraska and      Illinois report that cars run on a one-to-five mixture of      Tsao's alcohol and gasoline perform well and, possibly,      pollute less. SOLAR TRAINING IN STIR has begun at      Connecticut's Somers maximum security prison. The      institution has started to train inmates to design, sell,      and set up solar energy equipment . . . . Dire, a small      town on the Niger River in Mali, will soon install an      80-KILOWATT SOLAR POWER STATION, which will supply much of      the village's energy . . . . THE DUNG FROM FIVE ELEPHANTS      in the Bronx Zoo now heats-through its      decomposition-greenhouses in the New York Botanical      Gardens. After it decomposes, the manure is used as      fertilizer . . . . " CHURCH ENERGY KITS " are available      from Katherine Seelman of the National Council of Churches      (475 Riverside Drive, New York, New York 10027). The kit is      designed to help churches use energy conservation methods .      . . . A number of SOLAR BUS TOURS -organized by the      Mid-Atlantic Solar Energy Association (University of      Pennsylvania at Philadelphia)-will take the curious      to visit solar-heated homes and factories . . . . UP TO 30%      OF NEW YORK STATE'S ELECTRICAL NEEDS could be met by the      development of its small-scale hydroelectric potential,      says a report from the New York Energy Research and      Development Administration, 230 Park Avenue, New York, New      York 10017 . . . . Six Philadelphia hospitals have SAVED      $500,000 IN ANNUAL FUEL COSTS with the use of energy      conservation techniques.    </p>
