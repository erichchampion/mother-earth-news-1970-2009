        Older windows are often big energy wasters. Buying new,energy-efficient windows is one way to reduce this lost energy, butthere are also several inexpensive repairs that can improve theperformance of your current windows.<br /><br />Any drafts you feel when standing next to a window are likely dueto air infiltration around the window frame or sash perimeter.Address drafts by installing sash locks and weatherstripping aroundthe perimeter of the window. For double-hung windows, considerside-mounted sash locks that pull the window tight to the sides ofthe frame, not just where the sash rails meet.<br /><br />You also can remove the inside trim surrounding the window to seehow it was installed into the framing cavity. Any air space betweenthe house shell and the window frame can cause significant airleakage and should be sealed. If the gap is not too wide, then itcan be sealed with caulk, backer rod or nonexpanding foam. Forwindows with ropes and pulleys, buy pulley seals to stop airinfiltration there.<br /><br />You can reduce heat loss through windows by covering them withplastic window film or insulating window inserts, such as thoseavailable at <a href="http://www.windotherm.com" target="_blank">Windo-Therm</a>.Another option is to make simple window quilts by sandwiching apiece of Bubble Wrap between two pieces of cloth material, whichcan be rolled up and down as needed.
