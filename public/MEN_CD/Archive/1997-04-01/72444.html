                <p>      <strong>HOME REMEDIES</strong>    </p>        <p>      <strong>Healthful plants are often as close as your      door.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Christopher Nyerges    </h5>        <p>      The true prophet is never accepted by his own people. By      some strange quirk of human nature, we tend to think that      only something from a faraway country can be of the      greatest value. This blindness also affects us when it      comes to herbs and nutrition. We think that the best      substances for our health are only those herbs and roots      imported from faraway China or India or South American rain      forests, sold at tremendous costs in small bottles at the      herb shop.    </p>    <p>      When you scan the shelves of herb shops, it's easy to come      to the conclusion that health can be purchased in a bottle.      In fact, many businesses push that very idea: "Buy our      [expensive] product and you'll be happier, live longer, be      free of disease, and have a great sex life, besides:"    </p>    <p>      In this country, we are surrounded by an unbelievable      bounty of nature. lust about everything that you'd want for      health and nutrition can be found in your backyard or in      the wild, or it can be easily grown. No money need change      hands. Shockingly, many of the most nutritious plants on      the planet are despised as common weeds, and at any nursery      in town, you can buy poisons to kill off these valuable      weeds. Such sad ignorance.    </p>        <h3>      Poor Man's Cure-All    </h3>    <p>      Dandelions are probably better for you than anything in      your garden, wild or cultivated. An analysis of 100 grams      (about a cup) of dandelion greens by the U.S. Department of      Agriculture shows 14,000 IU of vitamin A, 35 mg of vitamin      C, 397 mg of potassium, 66 mg of phosphorus, 187 mg of      calcium, and 36 mg of magnesium. Dandelion greens are also      the richest source of beta-carotene, with 8.4 mg per cup.      By contrast, carrots considered an excellent source of      betacarotene-contain 6.6 mg per cup. Only young dandelion      greens are good in salads, and the older bitter leaves can      be cooked like spinach or added to mixed vegetable dishes.      And the young dandelion roots can also be cooked.    </p>    <h3>      Nature's "Mineral Tablet"    </h3>    <p>      The health food store shelves are full of pills, including      mineral tablets. But nature provides an excellent      alternative-one that you take advantage of by eating. This      is lamb's-quarter, a spinach relative found worldwide in      the wild. It probably grows in your garden even if you      don't plant it. Used raw in salad or in juice mixes, 100      grams of lamb's-quarter (about a cup) contains about 80 mg      of vitamin C, 11,600 IU of vitamin A, 72 mg of phosphorus,      309 mg of calcium, and small amounts of thiamin,      riboflavin, niacin, and iron. These figures are slightly      lower when you cook the lamb's-quarter for a spinach      replacement, or in soups, egg dishes, or vegetable dishes.      You could nearly survive on lamb's-quarter alone!    </p>    <h3>      Clear Thinking with Ginkgo    </h3>    <p>      Ginkgo leaves and nuts have been used in the Orient for      centuries, and are one of the new popular herbal      medications in the U.S. Some researchers suggest that      ginkgo may help Alzheimer's patients, and that it should      help anyone increase mental alertness. And there are      several processed bottles of ginkgo pills on the shelf with      the expensive price tag.    </p>    <p>      Guess what? Ginkgo is widely planted as a street and park      tree! It is very common, and you can simply take the leaves      and brew your own tea. Never mind that the pill      manufacturers report that you shouldn't do this-you can!      Make an infusion of the leaves, or if you prefer, simply      powder the dried leaves and fill gelatin capsules if you      prefer to take your herbs in pill form.    </p>    <p>      And don't overlook the nuts which fall in September and      October. The fleshy outer layer of these nuts have a foul      odor, but it is easily cleaned off. The nuts can be dried      or roasted, then eaten. Many of the same qualities of the      leaves have been attributed to these nuts.    </p>    <h3>      Get Your Daily Vitamin C    </h3>    <p>      Roses are great to grow in any garden because they provide      beauty and fragrance. Also, if you let the fruits mature      (referred to as the "hips"), you'll have a rich source of      vitamin C. The only known source of vitamin C that is      richer is the acerola. Rose hips contain about 7,000 mg of      vitamin C per pound, a remarkable amount. By contrast, a      pound of oranges (depending on the type of orange) contains      anywhere between 100 to 250 mg of vitamin C.    </p>    <p>      To use rose hips, first snip off the orange-red mature      fruit. Once you cut it in half and remove the fibrous      seeds, you could just eat it raw. However, most people find      it more enjoyable to simmer into tea, or to make it into      jams, jellies, or blended nutritional drinks.    </p>    <h3>      Is Milk the Best Calcium Source?    </h3>    <p>      One hundred grams of the edible portion of the carob pod      (about a cup of the entire pod, minus the seeds) contains      352 mg of calcium. That makes carob one of the very richest      non-meat calcium sources. Even when that same volume is      compared to milk-generally considered a good calcium      source-carob is nearly three times richer in calcium. Carob      is also a good source of B vitamins. Though not a complete      protein, it is said that this is the food that sustained      John the Baptist in the desert for 40 days (hence the name,      Saint John's bread).    </p>    <p>      You can simply eat the pods and spit out the seeds. Also,      you can crack the pods, remove the seeds, and grind the      pods into a flour, which you can add to bread and pasty      products, or blend into liquids like rice or soy milk.    </p>    <p>      Throughout southern California and the Southwest, there are      tens of thousands of carob trees, mostly along streets and      in parks. The brown leathery pods ripen from September      through February.    </p>    <h3>      Cough and Sore Throat    </h3>    <p>      Oil of eucalyptus is an active ingredient in many cough      medicines, and eucalyptus trees are extremely common. You      can simply pick a few eucalyptus leaves, make a hot tea by      infusion, and drink it. The flavors of the various types of      eucalypti differ, so you might smell around until you find      one you like. This tea relieves symptoms of most breathing      and respiratory ailments.    </p>    <h3>      Cuts and Bruises    </h3>    <p>      When you get a few minor cuts and scratches while doing      work, do you reach for that tube of creamy stuff and rub it      over your wounds? There's something better. You could just      pinch off a bit of an aloe vera plant, break open the leaf,      and spread that gel directly onto the cuts. Aloe has been      used for centuries for such medicinal applications. Aloe is      easy to grow in pots or in the garden, and is widely      available at nurseries. Even the best bottled aloe      preparations are not as good as the fresh plant.    </p>    <h3>      Cheating Cholesterol    </h3>    <p>      You have high cholesterol, and there are a number of things      your doctor has told you to do: Cut out salts, fatty and      oily foods, stop smoking, eliminate alcohol, exercise more,      and lose some weight. Did you know that numerous studies      have shown that including garlic and onions in your diet      can reduce your cholesterol level? We don't normally think      of garlic and onions as "medicine," but they have a variety      of proven or reputed medical properties, and the lowering      of cholesterol levels is perhaps the most documented. In      this case, you simply eat your garlic and onions-ideally,      raw when possible-in order to receive the beneficial      qualities.    </p>    <p>      Another good way to lower cholesterol levels is to include      foods in your diet that are high in omega-3 fatty acids. In      1986, two biochemists (Norman Salem, Jr., with the National      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism in Bethesda,      Maryland, and Artemis Simopoulos of the American      Association for World Health in Washington, D.C.)      discovered that a common weed, purslane, is the richest      leafy-plant source of omega-3 fatty acids. And purslane is      such a common weed, worldwide, that you shouldn't need to      plant it-you may just need to look for it. It is common in      rose beds. To take advantage of purslane's benefits, you      simply eat it in salads, or cook it in soups, stews,      vegetable dishes, etc.    </p>    <h3>      Headache    </h3>    <p>      Have a headache? Before you automatically reach for that      aspirin, first ask yourself: What is the source my      headache? Perhaps your pain is trying to tell you      something: You're under a lot of stress, or have had too      much caffeine or not enough sleep. Then, consider the      original source of aspirin: the inner bark of the willow      tree. The cambium layer of willow bark contains salicin,      which the body converts to salicylic acid-the active      ingredient in most aspirin. If you grew a willow bush or      tree in your yard, you could prune off a small twig, remove      the bark, brew that bark for a few minutes in warm water,      and then drink it for headaches. The tea may be mildly      bitter, but will work (more or less) as well as aspirin.      Willow is extremely common worldwide along waterways.    </p>    <h3>      Diabetes    </h3>    <p>      According to long-standing traditions throughout northern      Mexico, eating the young prickly pear cactus pad (once the      stickers are removed) is said to help with diabetes. In the      past 20 years, I have met dozens of people who claim to      have had relief from adult-onset diabetes by consuming the      cactus, and I've met three who actually stopped taking      insulin. Doctors who have researched this have come up with      some medical verification. They say that the prickly pear      contains a substance that strengthens the pancreas so it is      more able to produce insulin. Plus, they say the fiber      content of the cactus is beneficial. Consuming the cactus      fruits has also been shown to be helpful for prostate      problems.    </p>    <p>      Prickly pear cactus is not restricted to the Southwest. It      is common throughout the Plains, and at least one variety      is common along the Atlantic coast.    </p>    <p>      These are just a few examples of how we can obtain many of      our needed healthful vitamins, necessary nutrients, and      even medications from plants growing all around us.    </p>    <p>      Needless to say, none of the above is intended to replace      competent, professional medical care for serious illness.      In the interest of increasing wisdom and self-reliance,      learning which plants can be used in place of bottled      vitamin pills and simple medicines will ultimately be more      health-promoting.    </p>
