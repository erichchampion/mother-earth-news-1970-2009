            		<p><strong>MOTHER'S      KITCHEN</strong></p>				<p><strong> ...Even in the North.</strong>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">    By Anne Vassal    </h5>    		    <p>      Before I moved to an area in Illinois with a great local      market, I thought that Mexican food was a      meat-bean-tortilla thing that I occasionally ate at the      nearby shopping mall. And salsa? It was that meek and mild      tomatoey bottled stuff used for chip dunking. Fortunately,      I left my small Michigan town to discover that ignorance      isn't bliss when it comes to Mexican food. Since my      arrival, I've eaten from taco stands in neighborhoods where      no one spoke English, tortillas were pressed by hand, and      delicious salsas were made from ingredients that I couldn't      pronounce. I searched cook books and attempted to duplicate      this wonderful cuisine, but without much success. So I      asked Hispanic friends or coworkers for advice. In my      preschool classroom, I asked parents to give Mexican      cooking demonstrations. Someone's grandma taught me the      secret to making chiles rellenos, another where to buy the      freshest tomatillos. The secret to any culture's cuisine      lies not only in the ingredients, but in in the method.      It's what's been passed down from generation to generation.      So I continue to ask questions, and once in a while, I      manage to cook something fabulous.    </p>        <p>      Since Mexican food is regional, ingredients and flavors can      vary, and some recipes can be time-consuming. Most of us      just want to duplicate what we've eaten at our favorite      Mexican restaurant without slaving over a hot mole sauce.      Here's Mexican Cooking 101-the recipes are basic, and      you'll be dipping into the salsa in no time.</p>			<h3>Chicken Enchiladas with Salsa Verde</h3>			<p> <em>1      whole chicken fryer, about 4 pounds<br />      1 small onion, peeled and quartered</em> <em><br />      4 large cloves garlic, smashed<br />      5 whole allspice<br />      5 peppercorns</em></p><p> Place the washed chicken in a soup pot,      and add just enough water to cover the chicken. Add the      rest of the ingredients. Cover and simmer for about one      hour, until the chicken is no longer pink (check the thigh      meat next to the bone). Remove the chicken from the pot and      put on a plate to cool. Strain the chicken broth, and store      or freeze in plastic containers. Pick the chicken off the      bones, discarding the skin and bones. Place the meat in a      container and chill until needed (within 3 days), or freeze      with a little of the broth.</p>			<h3>Salsa Verde (Green Sauce)</h3>			<p> <em>1 1/2 pounds tomatillos* (about      12-14)<br />      1 teaspoon oil<br /></em> <em>1/2 large onion,      chopped<br />      1/2 large cloves garlic, chopped<br />      1/2 jalapeno pepper, seeded and chopped (wear rubber      gloves)<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      pinch of ground coriander<br />      1 cup cilantro leaves (use more if you<br />      like cilantro)</em></p><p> Remove the husks from the tomatillos      and place in a saucepan, covering them with water. Bring to      a boil, reduce to simmer, and cook 10 minutes. The      tomatillos will be soft but not mushy. Drain; save a cup of      the water, and let cool. In a small skillet, heat the oil      and saute the onions, garlic, and jalapeno until they start      to brown. Put in a blender with the salt, pepper, and      coriander. When the tomatillos are cooled, cut out the core      as you would a tomato. Place in the blender with the      cilantro, and blend until almost smooth. Taste to see if      it's spicy enough. If not, saute and add the other half of      the jalapeno pepper. Check the thickness of the sauce and      add the reserved tomatillos water as needed. (The sauce      will thicken a bit in the refrigerator.) Pour into a      plastic container and chill. Use within 4-5 days.</p><p>      *See " South-of-the-Border Basics "</p><p> <em>warmed, cooked      chicken<br />      1/2 pound Mexican crumbling cheese, such as queso      añejo*<br />      1 package corn tortillas<br />      lite sour cream<br />      avocado slices</em></p><p> Shred, not cut, the chicken into small      pieces. Preheat oven to 350°F. Wrap the tortillas in a      damp, non-terry-cloth dish towel. Lightly oil the bottom of      a casserole dish or baking pan (I use a Pyrex rectangular      pan). Pour the salsa into a pie plate or shallow dish.      Crumble or grate the cheese into a bowl. Heat the tortillas      in the microwave for about 60 seconds, or just until      they're warm and pliable. (If you'd rather heat them in the      oven, wrap the dish towel in foil first.) Dip a tortilla in      the salsa, lay in the pan, and fill with about 1/4 cup of      chicken. Roll up and place the open side down. Do the same      with the other tortillas, laying them side by side. Spoon a      little more salsa across the middle of the enchiladas and      cover the pan with foil. Bake about 10 minutes, just until      warm, or the tortillas will start to fall apart. Using a      pancake turner, remove to the serving plates. Top each      enchilada with a tablespoon or so of cheese, a dollop of      sour cream, and an avocado slice.</p><p> *If not available, grate      or shred some chilled Muenster cheese in a food processor.</p>			<h3>Refried Beans</h3>			<p>Why open a can of refried      beans when you can open a can of pintos beans and make your      own delicious recipe instead? You can also use homemade      beans, but the canned are much faster and easier to mash.      <em>1 tablespoon canola oil<br /></em> <em>1 large onion,      finely chopped<br />      4 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      2 medium poblano peppers, * seeded and finely chopped<br />      1 teaspoon ground cumin<br />      2 29-ounce cans of pinto beans, undrained (1 use Preferida      brand)<br />      salt to taste (if beans aren't canned)</em></p><p> Heat the oil in      a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion,      garlic, and peppers. Saute until soft, stirring frequently.      Add cumin and saute for another minute while stirring. Pour      in the beans with the bean liquid. Start mashing the beans      with a potato masher or large wood en spoon. (It will      probably take about 5 minutes to mash most of the beans.)      Leave some beans whole so texture is chunky. (You can use a      food processor, but I find that it tends to puree the      beans.) Continue to cook beans for about 15 minutes; stir      and scrape the bottom occasionally so they don't burn. You      may have to reduce the heat a bit; it's okay if beans      bubble up while cooking. Beans are done when liquid has      cooked down; cook until the consistency suits your taste.      Beans will thicken as they sit.</p><p> *If poblano peppers aren't      available, use a green pepper and about 1/8 teaspoon      cayenne pepper.</p>			<h3>Red Rice</h3>			<p> This is the      classic rice that you'll find in your favorite Mexican      restaurant. It's best made ahead and reheated in the oven.</p><p>      <em>2 cups chicken or vegetable stock<br /></em> <em>1      tablespoon canola oil<br />      1 small onion, finely chopped<br />      2 large cloves garlic, minced<br />      1 small carrot, cut into V4 " cubes<br />      1 cup long-grain white rice, uncooked<br />      3/4 cup canned crushed tomatoes<br />      1/2 teaspoon salt<br />      pinch of cayenne pepper<br />      freshly ground pepper<br />      1 cup frozen peas</em></p><p> Simmer the broth in a saucepan while      you prepare the rest. In a large, nonstick skillet, heat      the oil on medium heat and add the onion, garlic, carrot,      and rice. Stir for about three minutes until the rice      starts to get toasty. Stir in the tomatoes and spices,      continuing to stir for about another minute. Stir in the      hot broth, cover, and reduce heat to low. Simmer for 20      minutes until liquid has been absorbed. Rice will be      sticky; check to see if it is sticking to the bottom of the      pan. (Rice will be less sticky after it's reheated.) Stir      and continue cooking if necessary. When the rice is ready,      stir in peas. Oil a square baking pan and transfer the rice      from the skillet. Let cool, cover with foil, and      refrigerate or set aside until needed. Reheat in a      325°F oven for 15 minutes.</p>			<h3>Jicama and Orange Salad</h3>			<p> This refreshing, no-fat salad complements      your Mexican dinner. If jicama is not available in your      neck of the woods, try white daikon radish or kohlrabi.</p><p>      <em>4 navel oranges (very sweet)<br />      1 medium jicama (about 3 cups)<br />      1/2 cup red onion, finely chopped<br /></em> <em>1/3 cup      lime juice (from 2 limes)<br />      1 tablespoon rice wine vinegar (or white wine      vinegar)<br />      2 teaspoons sugar<br />      dash of salt and cayenne pepper<br />      1/2 cup cilantro leaves, finely chopped</em></p><p> Cut the      oranges into quarters by cutting through the navel, then      peel and section them. Chop the orange sections into 1/4"      slices. Cut the jicama into 1/4 " slices. Peel off the skin      and cut into 1/4" dice. Whisk the sugar, salt, and cayenne      into the freshly squeezed lime juice. Pour over the salad      and toss with the cilantro. Refrigerate for at least an      hour before serving.</p>			<h3>Mexican Coffee</h3>			<p> This deliciously sweet      coffee is dessert all by itself. Make sure you use a good      quality coffee, not the stuff in a can.</p><p> <em>4 cups cold      water<br /></em> <em>4 cinnamon sticks<br />      1/3 cup brown sugar<br />      2/3 cup finely ground decaf or regular<br />      coffee (mild-tasting coffee is best)</em></p><p> In a large      saucepan, combine the water, sticks, and sugar. Heat to      almost a boil, and then simmer for 10 minutes. Remove from      heat. Add the coffee, cover, and let steep 5 minutes.      Remove the cinnamon sticks. Place a filter in your drip      coffee-maker with the pot underneath. Pour the coffee      mixture into the filter and let it drain into the pot.      Serve immediately or keep warm on the coffee burner. (If      coffee is too strong, add some hot water.)    </p>
