                    <h5 id="byline">By PEARL CHADWELL</h5>        <p>      Making something pretty and useful with your own hands      brings out a feeling of pride and accomplishment . . .      especially when that new item is constructed of "trash"      that would otherwise have been thrown away. Additionally,      in this day of inflated prices, it's a real discovery to      find a worthwhile craft material that doesn't cost a cent.      And finally, it's always satisfying to find a      way-however small-to solve the mounting      problems of waste disposal.    </p>    <p>      I find that I can blend an interesting home craft with a      small attack on both inflation and today's pollution      problem by recycling throwaway bread wrappers into soft,      cushiony, crocheted rugs. The finished floor coverings are      ideal for protecting the bathroom floor by the tub or under      the sink and are just as good for other uses, both in and      outside the house. My husband, for instance, made off with      one of my four-foot circular throws before I ever had a      chance to spread it in front of the kitchen sink (I'd made      the rug just for that spot, too). The mat, he says, is      perfect for lying on when he works under the car and it has      now become a permanent part of his equipment.    </p>    <p>      There's nothing complicated about preparing the bread      wrappers for crocheting. Start at the open end of each      empty bag and cut a continuous spiral-about an inch      wide-around and around the sack until you reach the      part that's glued together on the other end (this small      remaining piece is all the waste you'll have to throw      away). The beginning and end of each strip should taper to      a point (Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      One tool-a single metal crochet hook of the size used      for rug yarn-is the only equipment you'll need to      turn even the biggest stack of wrapper spirals into durable      and colorful floor coverings. Do make sure that hook is      metal, though, because plastic ones have a tendency to      stick to the wrappers.    </p>    <p>      Your first step in making a bread wrapper rug of any size      will be to fold one of the inch-wide strips right down the      middle so that it's only one half inch wide (the finished      floor covering will be more colorful if you turn the      printed side of the plastic out). Next lay the crochet hook      down and pass the end of the ribbon under and around the      widest part of the hook's handle or shaft and securely tie      the strip with a double knot. (NOTE: the ribbon is not      actually tied <em>to</em> the shaft . . . instead, the      handle is used as a "spacer" around which the beginning      loop of your rug's <em>chain stitch</em> is formed and      knotted.)    </p>        <p>      Once you've tied the first loop into the end of your first      plastic strip, pick up the crochet hook in your right hand,      hold the dangling plastic ribbon in your left and slide the      newly formed loop down the shank of the tool until the ring      is about an inch from the hooked end of your tool. Catch      the ribbon of plastic with the instrument's crook and pull      the strip through the knotted ring (thereby forming a      second loop). Slide the crochet hook forward for another      bite of ribbon and pull it back to form loop number three.      The continuing series of interconnected slipknots you're      making is called a chain stitch (Fig. 3) and you can extend      the procession indefinitely . . . or until you come to the      end of your first plastic string.    </p>    <p>      When you've crocheted to within a few inches of the end of      your "yarn", open the folded plastic flat, place the end of      a new strip over it (with an overlap of about three      inches), fold the two ribbons together and continue with      the chain stitch. This way, there won't be any knots in      your finished work.    </p>    <p>      The second stitch you'll need to know how to make (and it's      just as easy to learn as the first) to assemble a bread      wrapper rug is known as the <em>slip</em> <em>stitch</em>      (Fig. 4). This one is made by passing the hook through a      previously formed stitch (while maintaining the loop that's      already on the needle) before hooking a fresh section of      ribbon and pulling it through <em>both</em> old loops to      form a single new one. You'll use this slip stitch to do      things like fasten together two ends of a section of chain      stitching.    </p>    <p>      The only other stitch you'll need to master for your rug      making is called the <em>single crochet</em> (Fig. 5). For      the first half of this one you'll dirt the loop on your      needle up the shank until it's out of the way. Then you'll      pick up a formed stitch before hooking a fresh bite of      ribbon <em>which is pulled only through the formed stitch      and not through the loop being maintained on the needle's      shaft.</em> (At this point-Fig. 5c-you'll have      two loops-the brand new one and the one you started      with--on tire shank of the needle.) The single crochet      stitch is then finished by pulling a fresh section of      ribbon through <em>both</em> the loops on the needle . . .      to make a single new loop (Fig. 5e). As you add row on row      to your rugs, you'll find this stitch almost as important      as the basic chain stitch.    </p>    <p>      To start a round rug, chain stitch five times-making      sure you don't pull the loops too tight-and slip      stitch the ends of the chain together to form a ring. Now,      reaching <em>through</em> the center of the circle (instead      of through any of the individual five stitches) for the      first half of each and reaching outside the circle for the      second half of each . . . form enough single crochet      stitches-usually about ten-to reach completely around the      ring.    </p>    <p>      Don't stop forming single crochet stitches once you've      completed the circuit. Make the next one through the top      (see Fig. 2 for an explanation of the "top" and "bottom" of      a stitch) of the slip stitch used to join the ring and      continue on around the circle, hooking-as you      go-a new row of single crochet stitches into the row      you've just laid down.    </p>    <p>      You'll have to increase the number of single crochet      stitches in this new round by putting two into every other      stitch or so of the row inside. (No hard and fast rule can      be made for increasing but, in general, when you find      yourself reaching with the hook for the next loop . . .      it's time to add a stitch.) Continue around the developing      rug for another few rows and then lay the piece of work on      a flat surface. If its edge curves up like the sides of a      bowl, you're not increasing enough. If the edge ruffles,      you're increasing too much. In either case, pull the      stitches out until the rug lies flat and try again. It pays      to check often.    </p>    <p>      Continue working around the expanding perimeter until your      rug is as large as you want and-leaving five or six      inches of the plastic strip hanging free-end your      crocheting with a couple of slip stitches. Pull the      remaining ribbon through the last loop and use the crochet      hook to work the tail in and out of stitches in the      previous row until the strip is used up and none is left      dangling.    </p>    <p>      Before beginning an oval floor covering, you must determine      the site you want the finished product to be. Remember      that-since you'll be working around the center (as      with a round rug)-you'll be adding an inch of length      for every additional inch of width the piece grows (and      vice versa) . . . so you must determine the proportions of      the finished rug <em>before</em> you begin.    </p>    <p>      The chain with which you start an oval design should be as      long as the difference between the length and width of the      completed piece. That is, if you want a rug 48 inches long      and 30 inches wide, the starting chain should be 18 inches      in length (48 minus 30).<br />    </p>    <p>      To make the throw just described, crochet a chain 18 inches      long, add three additional chain stitches (for the first      turn), turn and single crochet back (using the top of the      18-inch length of chain stitches as a base). Continue      making single crochet stitches right on around the end of      the series of chain stitches (increase as necessary going      around the turn) and proceed to build the rug outward just      as you would crochet a round design. Increase enough on the      ends to keep the rug flat and smooth and do stagger the      increase stitches to keep the shape oval (adding the extra      stitches at the same points on each round will produce      square corners). Finish as you would finish a round design.    </p>    <p>      A square or rectangular rug is made a little differently      (by working back and forth instead of round and round).      Begin such a design with a series of chain stitches as long      as the desired width of the finished work . . . then chain      three more times, turn and single crochet the next row      using the top of the chain stitches as a base. When you      reach the end of the line of single crochet stitches, chain      three times, turn (the other way this time), add another      row of single crochet stitches, chain three times, turn the      way you turned the first time, etc. Continue this      back-and-forth pattern until the rug is as long as you want      it.    </p>    <p>      It's a good idea, when making a squared-off rug, to stop at      the end of the first single crochet row and count all the      stitches in that tier (but not the three chains at either      end). Then, as you continue to work, check occasionally to      make sure you're not increasing or decreasing the number of      stitches you add each time across.    </p>    <p>      You can wash and spin dry your bread wrapper rugs in the      washing machine, but never put them in a dryer. Hang the      damp pieces over a line instead.    </p>    <p>      Once you've had the satisfaction of creating one of these      colorful pieces, remind yourself again that you obtained      the raw materials for the handiwork absolutely free . . .      and that your recycling efforts have helped limit air,      water and land pollution just a tiny bit. That will      probably lead you to wonder why-when recycling works      so well with so little effort on a small scale-big      business, government and labor can't make it work on a      large scale. Why is that?    </p>
