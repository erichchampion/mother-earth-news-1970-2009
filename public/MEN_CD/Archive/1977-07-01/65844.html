                <p>      QUESTION: How do you grow spraddled-out pumpkin vines on a      cramped suburban lot?<br />      ANSWER: Make 'em spraddle UP, the way Patrick Fanning of      Richmond, California does!    </p>            <p>      We've always wanted to grow pumpkins, but the small size of      our yard (20' X 30') made it seem impossible. Last summer,      however, we raised pumpkins in <em>spite</em> of ourselves!      And here's how:    </p>    <p>      It all started when the seeds from our Halloween      jack-o'-lantern found their way into the compost pile.      Naturally, we expected microbial action and the heat of      decomposition to kill the seeds . . . but instead, a series      of cold winter rains kept the pile of wastes from heating      up as it should have, and in the spring-after      applying the soggy mulch/compost to our plants-we      began to see little pumpkin vines popping up all over!    </p>    <p>      We pulled dozens of the seedlings out of the strawberry      patch, from around the roses, and from the onions . . . but      one vine-hidden behind the peas-escaped our      notice. When the peas finally gave out in June, we      discovered the volunteer vine-which was some three      feet long-thriving underneath.    </p>    <p>      Rather than uproot such a healthy specimen, we decided to      see if we could coax the young vine into growing      <em>upwards</em> rather than <em>outwards.</em> To do this,      we drove a spike into the eave of our patio roof, looped an      old hunk of manila rope over the nail, and tied the two      longest pumpkin runners to the dangling ends of the rope      with strips of rag.    </p>    <p>      Because pumpkins are ramblers-not climbers-by      nature, we found it necessary every four or five      days-after the vines had grown another foot or      two-to tie the growing end of the vines to the rope      with wide strips of rag to keep the plant from flopping      over and heading for <em>terra firma</em> again. Still,      there was no question that the vines <em>were</em> indeed      making their way up the rope.    </p>    <p>      The higher the plants got, the more sunlight they saw and      the faster they grew. By the Fourth of July, the two      original vines had traveled three feet along the ground and      eight feet straight up to the patio roof. (Two more vines      had made it halfway up a nearby post.) Of the dozens of      blossoms that appeared, five had become pollinated and      started to grow. These five pumpkins-which were about      the size of softballs-dangled from he vines at various      heights, growing bigger and heavier by the hour.    </p>    <p>      Pumpkin vines are tough, but not tough enough to support      the weight of their mature fruit. Because of this, we      decided to make individual "hammocks" out of pieces of old      sheets to hold the fruits up and keep them from snapping      off the vine. (At this point, our patio had become quite a      strange sight, what with a solid green wall of foot-wide      leaves covering one side of the patio and numerous white      slings-each with a pumpkin in it-hanging down      from the eaves like so many broken arms and legs. It looked      as if our whole pumpkin plant was in traction!)    </p>    <p>      The vines leading across the patio's white fiberglass roof      eventually developed more pumpkins, some of which had to be      shifted to keep them over the rafters or chocked so they      wouldn't roll off the pitched roof. Cars on the street      behind our house had begun to slow down as they drove by,      and passing aircraft wobbled dangerously.    </p>    <p>      Our elevated "punkin" patch may have looked weird, but it      certainly was productive. The airborne vines got plenty of      sun all day, and both the fruit and the vines were well      clear of all the damp and rot and mildew and pests with      which earthbound pumpkins contend. The result was a bumper      crop of gigantic orange fruits!    </p>    <p>      Next year? We'll grow pumpkins, all right . . . but not by      default. First of all, we'll pick a tastier, smaller      variety than the "jack-o'-lantern specials" we grew last      year. Second, we'll plant our seeds closer to the patio,      use rigid stakes instead of rope, and trim away unwanted      vines to stimulate the faster growth of those that we train      to reach the roof. If we get an early start -and practice      heavy feeding and trimming-we may be able to do away with      the hanging fruit and have all the pumpkins rest on the      roof, thereby eliminating the need for slings.    </p>    <p>      True, it's more work to tie up our pumpkin vines than to      let them ramble . . . but when you have nothing but a      cramped, 20' X 30' yard to work with, the only place      <em>to</em> go is up!    </p>
