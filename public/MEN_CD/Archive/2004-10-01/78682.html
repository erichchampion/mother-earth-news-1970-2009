                    <p>      <em>Enjoy your own white sage and sweetgrass. -</em>    </p>		<h5 id="byline">		<em>By Brook Elliott</em>		</h5>        <p>      Incense. Right now it’s riding a crest of popularity.      Numerous plant materials have been used as incense because      of their fragrances, but two native plants stand out:      sweetgrass (Hierochloe odorata) and white sage (Salvia      apiana).    </p>    <p>      Richo Cech of Horizon Herbs in Williams, Ore., describes      the smell of sweetgrass as “vanillalike or new-mown      haylike,” and attributes the scent to the      plant’s coumarin content. White sage, he says, is      penetrating, spicy, camphoraceous - and slightly      skunky.    </p>    <p>      As an incense, white sage is burned to purify people and      places, and its use sometimes is accompanied by prayer.      Loose leaves often are burned, and a traditional ritual      method for smudging the body calls for spreading the smoke      by “brushing” it with a feather or bird wing.      An alternative is to bind several stems together into a      smudge stick. Either way, the leaves smolder, rather than      burn with an open flame.    </p>    <p>      Due to growing demand, commercial development in both      plants’ native habitats and improper management of      remaining wild stands, white sage and sweetgrass are both      in trouble.    </p>    <p>      “The biggest stands of wild sweetgrass are in Canada      where most of the commercial dried braids come from, but      wildcrafting is hurting them,” says Craig Dremann,      owner of Redwood City Seeds in Redwood City, Calif.      “Dried sweetgrass leaves contain very important soil      nutrients. The phosphorus and other minerals removed with      the harvested leaves are not being replenished, and, I      believe, the subsequent diminished soil fertility is      causing stands to decline.”    </p>    <p>      The situation for white sage is bad, too. The plant is      native to just a small strip of coastal Southern      California, where development is intense. The      sustainability of wild populations of white sage may be      adversely affected by development, overharvesting and      unfavorable weather, although the plant is a tough      contender in drylands and in rough, unsettled country.    </p>    <p>      Fortunately, both sweetgrass and white sage can be easily      grown at home, and Cech says, in the garden each      contributes a beautiful and cleansing presence. By growing      them, you can provide for your own incense needs and      perhaps have enough to sell. A thriving market exists for      sweetgrass braids and white sage smudge sticks and dried      leaves. Local farmer’s markets and the Internet are      primary outlets; they also sell well in bookstores,      galleries, jewelry stores and souvenir shops.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Growing Sweetgrass</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Sweetgrass grows wild in the northern regions of North      America and Europe. Because most sweetgrass seed is      infertile, stands are started from root plugs, available      from various suppliers.    </p>    <p>      Cech, who also is the author of Making Plant Medicine and      Growing At-Risk Medicinal Herbs, says, “Actually,      fertile seed is sometimes available, but empty seedcoats      are common and, even when germplasm is present, it is      loaded with germination inhibiting compounds.” So the      plant is more easily grown using other methods.    </p>    <p>      Plugs should be planted in potting soil using shallow, wide      plastic pots, and kept in the shade for a couple of weeks      to develop new roots, according to both Dremann and Cech.      Young plants can be grown in the pots until they fill out;      then they should be transplanted into the garden, spaced      about a foot apart. Do not use clay or peat pots; in both      containers, the roots can dry out too quickly.    </p>    <p>      Sweetgrass prefers rich, moist, slightly sandy soil and      full sun. It’s important to keep it constantly moist,      but not soggy. Dremann says the plant is a heavy feeder, so      fertilize it at least twice during the growing season with      blood meal and bone meal for best results.    </p>    <p>      There are two types of stems: stout ones, which flower from      June to August, and lanky, non-flowering stems.      Traditionally, both are harvested for braids by pulling      them out of the base sheath: Support the base of the plant      with one hand while pulling the longer blades out of the      basal sheath. This way the roots are undisturbed, which      allows the plant to regrow, and leaves the blades at      maximum length for braiding.    </p>    <p>      Lay out the cut stems in the sun to dry in batches no more      than an inch thick. Periodically, turn the stems so they      dry evenly, and when they’re almost dry, braid them.      The braids add a rich vanilla aroma to their surroundings,      and generally are kept as is, rather than being burned.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Growing White Sage</strong></strong>    </p>        <p>      Also known as Grandfather sage and bee sage, white sage is      considered a sacred plant by many Native American tribes.      It burns with a penetrating, slightly skunky pungency, Cech      says.    </p>    <p>      A perennial that grows 2 to 5 feet high, white sage has      gray-green young leaves that turn a dramatic white as they      mature. The flowers, which bloom during the summer, are      silvery white with a lavender tinge. The seed has a natural      low germination rate - about 15 percent - so if      you decide to try seed, sow it in very sandy soil or a      commercial cactus mix, and water daily; average germination      time is 14 days.    </p>    <p>      White sage is cold-hardy only as far north as Zone 8b (15      degrees); outside of Southern California, Arizona and New      Mexico, it should be cultivated as an annual or brought      indoors for the winter. Repot seedlings into ceramic pots,      using the same cactus/soil mix, and move them to the      garden, or transplant them, about 2 feet apart, to a dry,      sunny area. Good drainage is essential; most sages do not      like wet feet and white sage won’t tolerate it at      all.    </p>    <p>      <strong><strong>Plant Sources</strong></strong>    </p>  <p>      <strong>Horizon Herbs</strong><br />      P.O.
