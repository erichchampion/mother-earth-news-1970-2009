                    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" Plitt graduated from college with a      degree in agriculture in 1932. During the years that      followed he made a good many friends and a name for himself      (as a gentleman, inventor and executive) in the field of      bird and animal husbandry and care. At various points in      his career, Mr. Plitt served as Director of Nutritional      Research and Field Services for two of the East's larger      grain mills.</em> <em>He is also the originator of Pride of      the Valley Wild Bird Food and Kleen Kitty cat litter. Mr.      Plitt now raises and trains standardbred horses and keeps a      wide variety of other birds and animals on a New York      farm.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"Poppy George" is now sharing his experience by giving      MOTHER's readers down-to-earth advice on the care and      feeding of homestead livestock. Questions should be mailed      to Mr. George Plitt, Happiness Hills Farms, RD 3, Addison,      N. Y. 14801.</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : I have a few dollars and want      to start a flock of sheep. Should I buy registered stock or      just plain woollies?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : Spend your "few dollars" on 12 to      15-more if you can afford them-young crossbred      ewes (not registered). That way, you'll get extra vigor for      your money. Then buy a male of the Suffolk or Hampshire      variety, not necessarily registered, and you're off to a      good start. (One ambitious ram can serve 40 females.) Be      sure, though, to look at the mouths and teeth of the sheep      you plan to purchase. If they're too old, pass them by and      find young, healthy stock elsewhere.    </p>    <p>      Sheep combine the profitable elements of cattle and swine      without the high investment. You must like these animals,      however, to make raising them a profitable enterprise.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : How long will laying hens      continue to produce fertile eggs after the rooster has been      removed from a flock?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : If the rooster was doing his job      properly, your hens' eggs will continue to be fertile for      ten days to two weeks after he's gone. The pattern follows      the laying cycle of each bird: That is, if a hen produces      daily for seven days, stops for a day or two and then lays      for another week, the first batch of eggs should be      fertile.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : I have a stallion and a nice      mare with a spring foal. There are little orange      "somethings" attached to the hairs of the horses' legs.      What are they, and what if anything should I do about them?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : The objects are the eggs of the      botfly, which fastens them to the leg hairs of horses. The      animals are annoyed by these attachments and try to remove      them, but ingest them in the process . . . and the life      cycle of the insect is underway. The eggs hatch in the      stomach and the larvae attach themselves like barnacles to      the digestive tract, causing their hosts pain and loss of      weight. To help prevent such an infestation, keep your      horses' leg hair clipped short and-after the first      killing frost in your area-worm the animals for this      pest. One treatment is usually enough to do the job.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : What future do you predict for      small poultrymen like me over the next ten years?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : A profitable future exists for      you small but efficient egg producers because your labor      costs are negligible and you're likely to do a more      conscientious job of management . . . thereby reducing      production expenses. Equally important is the marketing      factor. Usually a small-scale poultryman can retail his      products at a premium . . . so aim for success on the basis      of personal service and quality, and you'll retain the      loyalty of your customers.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : I know you're into animals      rather than plants, Poppy, but do you happen to know      anything about the berries of the jujube tree . . . if      there is such a species?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : Yes, my field <em>is</em> animal      husbandry, but I try to keep alert to new findings in the      related area of nutrition . . . and I learned recently that      the berries of the jujube lgenus Ziziphus) are used to      treat hypertension. A series of experiments by a Soviet      scientist has confirmed the natural medicinal value of the      fruit, which contains eight times as much vitamin P as      lemon peel, five to six times as much vitamin C as oranges      and many trace elements as well. The tree is hardy and      easily withstands temperatures as low as-22° F      and as high as 104°.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : A neighbor told me it was      dangerous to let my cow and goats eat grass after frost has      hit our area. Poppy, I'm trying to stretch the hay I have      in the barn and wonder whether he's correct.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : I don't agree with your neighbor.      Before the advent of man and farming as we know it, cattle,      sheep, deer, goats, etc., were already here . . . staying      healthy and multiplying without prepared foods, just by      eating whatever was available year-round.    </p>    <p>      <em>(I agree about native grasses eaten free-choice, Poppy,      but I also know-from sad firsthand experience-that      imported and "devel</em> <em>oped" forage crops are a      different story. In short, newly frosted ladino, sudax,      bromegrass-even the frosted green stalks of some      hybrid corn-can kill a cow deader than the proverbial      doornail. A lush stand of clover or alfalfa drenched in dew      can also cause cows to bloat so fast that half your herd      can be down and dead before you know anything's wrong. . .      if you foolishly let formerly penned animals suddenly eat      their fill of such pasture.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The secret is to start your cows, goats, etc., on fresh      pasture-a little bit at a time-very early in      the spring and then gradually increase the amount of such      forage everyday. Never suddenly turn the stock into a fresh      pasture (especially if it's dew-soaked) for the first time      and allow them to eat their fill. Ladino, brome and      sudaxeven alfalfa and clover-should never be planted      in pure or nearly pure stands... but only in mixes that      contain plenty of orchard and native blade grasses Beware      of early frosts and keep your stock from eating frosted      "developed" forage. It's generally OK for the animals to      consume such food once it's thawed out and dried off,      however .... especially if they always have some cured      hay-or even straw-in the barn or barnlot to eat free-choice      so that they can balance out their diet as they see      fit-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : How o ld must my heifer be      before I can have her bred?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : The heifer-if properly fed      and of good size-can be bred at 13 or 14 months.      She'll then calve at 24 months, the ideal time.    </p>    <p>      <strong>QUESTION</strong> : Several of my hens have large      swellings on their feet, around the toes and on the heels.      My neighbors and a vet say that this condition is      contagious and the birds must be destroyed. Is this      necessary, Poppy George?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ANSWER</strong> : Your hens undoubtedly have      "bumblefoot", which is not contagious but is caused by      bruising. Either your roosts or perches are too high off      the ground, or you've spread insufficient litter (straw,      sawdust, shavings, Staz-Dry, etc.) on the floor of the      coop. The layer should be three to four inches deep to act      as a cushion.    </p>    <p>      Here's how to help the affected birds: On the bottom of the      sore foot will be a scab or core. Pick this out (you'll      find a cheesy material in the swelling) and pour iodine      into the wound. In a week or so, if the condition of the      henhouse is corrected, your flock will be healthy and      happy.    </p>
