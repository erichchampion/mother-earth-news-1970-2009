                       <p>      Well, the big World Energy Conference held in Detroit      September 23-27 has come and gone . . . and, as predicted      (see Energy Flashes, MOTHER NO. 29), it was a political      boondoggle. The <em>real</em> action in the field for the      month of Sep t ember and the city of Detroit took place a      few days before (on the 20th and 21st) when the first      genuine meeting of the American Wind Energy Association was      held in the basement of one of the Motor City's police      stations.    </p>        <p>      Marcellus Jacobs was there. . . and Henry Clews and Big      Bill Delp and Solomon Kagin and Great Lakes Windpower and      Dyna Technology and Roha Tower and North Wind and Sun      Structures and 21st Century Living and Geoffrey Gerhard and      Wind Works and Soleq and Windlight Alaska and Creative      Electronics and a whole bunch of other folks and companies      who already are-or soon will be-well known for      their efforts in harnessing moving masses of air.    </p>    <p>      Al O'Shea (whose merry-and dang capable-crew at      Environmental Energies, Inc. put the affair together) was      elected president of the new organization and Real Gas and      Electric Company's Solomon Kagin is AWEA's first vice      president. Susan Lee Gerhard (West Wind) was named      secretary and the treasurer of the wind power group is      Nancy Horning of Environmental Energies, Inc. Bill Delp, Al      O'Shea, Chuck Pipher and Charles Leverich make up the      American Wind Energy Association's board of directors.    </p>    <p>      Is the new organization dynamic? Well . . . when the WEC      goldbricks arrived in Detroit to <em>talk</em> about energy      . . . they were greeted <em>by</em> <em>a working,      wind-powered, lighted billboard</em> erected by AWEAer Al      O'Shea and the Environmental Energies, Inc. gang. I'd say      that was dynamic, wouldn't you?    </p>    <p>      If you'd like an information packet about the AWEA, write      to Al O'Shea, American Wind Energy Association, 21243 Grand      River, Detroit, Michigan 48219. Stick a dollar in with your      letter (the AWEA is still a shoestring operation) and tell      Al that MOTHER sent you.    </p>
