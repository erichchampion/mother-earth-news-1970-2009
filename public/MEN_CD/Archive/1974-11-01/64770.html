                                <p>      <em>It was back in June of this year that MOTHER received a      letter from George H. Ramsey, Associate Professor of the      School</em> <em>of Architecture at the Georgia Institute of      Technology in Atlanta. "I just wanted to let you know that      I read your magazine," he said, "and that you have a friend      here at Georgia Tech. I've done a little bit of village      planning and I might be of some help when you get ready to      start on your self-contained Ecological Research Center.      Let me know if you want to talk about it and, by the way,      do you know of any good sources of heat pipes?"</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, we wrote back and told George to get in touch      with Isothermics, Inc. (P.O. Box 86, Augusta, New Jersey      07822) and that we most certainly were interested in      picking his brain for Research Center ideas, And that's as      far as the matter went.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Until late this September, when George gave us a ring      and asked if he could bring some Georgia Tech architectural      students up to see MOTHER's offices. "What we really have      in mind," he said, "is to get your ideas about the Research      Center so we can spend the next semester doing some work on      the concept. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well, we weren't really too happy about the offer      because we were just finishing the fall catalogues for      MOTHER'S Bookstore and the General Store and we were in the      middle of this issue of the magazine and a week behind on      the deadline for our newspaper feature and some guys on the      West Coast wanted to do a TV show about us and we were      trying to push the solar-heated house book through and a      design firm in Detroit was working on our little car and we      had magazines to ship and mailings going out to dealers and      merchandise and books to order for the fall season and now      here was this professor, for crying out loud, who wanted us      to sit down and think about what the Research Center should      be like so he could have a "real" project for some college      class to work on.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Damn. Well, OK. "Come on in, " we said, "and we'll try      to concentrate long enough to sort of halfway intelligently      let you know what we want the Research Center to do. "</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And, sure enough, Ole George did bring a dozen      junior-level architectural students on in to Hendersonville      early in October. And we spent a good long day struggling      to find some way to turn our vague, country boy concepts      into design parameters that would mean something to people      trained (and training) in the field of community      planning.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Evidently it was all worthwhile for the folks on the      other end of the exchange and the students were able to      pick a few nuggets from a rather large pile of chaff...      because a class of 21 or 22 people are now hard at work      down at Georgia Tech on six or eight different designs for      the Center.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And-despite our foot-dragging-the exchange      was extremely gratifying to the folks on this end. Because      we became acquainted with 12 concerned, capable and rather      impressive architectural students. So concerned, capable      and impressive that we're now anxious to meet the rest of      George's class and we're excitedly awaiting the unveiling      of everyone's renderings and models of the forthcoming      proposed designs for the Research Center.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Because somewhere in the early stages of our day-long      discussion, it became apparent that George H. Ramsey was      not your usual bookbound professor of architecture. Why,      this guy had just spent the summer actually pouring      concrete for a house he's building out in his home state of      Oklahoma. He knows what it's like to get his hands dirty!      Ole George is all right.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And he has the book-learning and theory too: Ramsey      studied at the University of Tulsa, got his Bachelor of      Architecture degree from Oklahoma State University and      received an Architect DPLG (the equivalent of a Ph.D.) from      the Ecole Nationale Superieure des Beaux Arts School of      Architecture at the University of Paris in France. George      won the Medaille d' Argent in France's 1963 National      Student Competition for the design of a 500-room hotel, the      Medaille de Bronze in 1965 for the "Best Individual Thesis      Project of the Year" and (in the United States) a National      Association of Collegiate Schools of Architecture grant to      design and teach a graduate course in Energy Conservation      and Environmental Design.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>This guy just might be able to inspire a class into      designing a first-rate Research Center . . . especially      since he's been integrating solar and wind energy systems      into his course work for at least two years and since he      organized and directed a "first" major conference on Low      Impact Energy Systems at Georgia Tech which featured Selwyn      Bloom (Energy Conservation in Building Design), Dr. Erich      Farber (Solar Energy) and Dr. Phillip Coulter (Wind      Energy).</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dr. Ramsey, of course, has many more honors and credits      to his name but I imagine you've already read enough to      know that he seems to be about as ideally qualified as any      professor of architecture in the country to tackle MOTHER'S      Research Center. If you need any further convincing,      however, the following Plowboy Paper should do the      job.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>The paper is taken from an address Dr. Ramsey gave in      the spring of 1974 at the annual "Tech Today" conference      held on the Georgia Tech campus. The speech was written      before 12% interest rates and the summer/fall plunge of the      stock market. Which is to say that enough of Dr. Ramsey's      predictions have already come true to add a certain amount      of weight to the rest of his view of the future.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>While George originally meant his address to be a      rather specialized discussion of one facet of modern life      (the relationship of architectural      design-particularly urban planning-to energy      consumption), it is interesting to note how often his      thoughts spill over into other fields and have a far wider      application. That's the way it is with the environment,      though . . . you can't touch a spider without shaking its      whole web. Professor George Ramsey knows that, and I wish a      bunch of other professors did too.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>And by the way: Professor Ramsey has another very      endearing quality for a man of his stature. He likes to be      called George. I think we're going to get along just fine .      . . and we'll be showing you those Research Center models      once they're completed.</em>    </p>    <p>      The use of energy has long been associated with prosperity,      economic development and quality of life. It has provided      fuel for our transportation and the heating and cooling we      use in our homes. It has been the driving force behind our      construction, land development, industry and business.    </p>    <p>      Energy is also intimately linked with our current concepts      of freedom of movement, expansion, consumption and growth.      Its reduced availability, accompanied by diminishing      national resources, threatens our entire life pattern and      ultimately will change all current thought in schools of      planning and architecture. Ultimately, the reduced      availability of energy will change society itself.    </p>    <p>      This process, in fact, is already well underway and is      evidenced at every level . . . from a two-year staff study      of "The Potential of Energy Conservation" by the      President's Office of Emergency Preparedness . . . through      nationally reduced speed limits . . . to lowered thermostat      settings in our homes. Americans <em>are,</em> voluntarily      or involuntarily, changing their lifestyles and the process      will be continuous from this point forward in time. The      graphs that accompany this article indicate the seriousness      of our condition and the necessity for change.    </p>    <p>      These graphs illustrate two critical points: [1] the supply      of fuel, resources and energy will never again meet demand      and [2] we should note that most of the national and urban      complexes in this country have been built during an era of      assumed unlimited energy.    </p>            <h3>      U.S. VS. EUROPEAN CITIES    </h3>    <p>      The major metropolitan centers of Europe-Rome, Paris,      London, Moscow, etc.-were well established prior to      1860 and were essentially designed about pedestrian      movement within the city and horse-drawn agrarian supply      from the surrounding environment. This was particularly      true of small communities . . . but even the larger cities      of Europe have traditionally consisted primarily of three-      and four-story walkups and have been extremely compact. The      inhabitants have usually lived over their shops or within a      15-minute walk of their places of employment.    </p>    <p>      This pattern was not particular to any nation. It was      universal and simply a result of functional necessity and      (in part) the building technology of the era in which the      cities of Europe were established. Over a period of      hundreds of years, this approach to urban planning became a      cultural pattern in the countries where it existed and      contemporary additions to European cities essentially      maintain that pattern.    </p>    <p>      Another important reason for the continuing compactness of      metropolitan areas in Europe is the population/land ratio      of the countries involved. France, for example, has 1/3 of      the United States' population living in an area smaller      than Texas. Holland is even more severely cramped. The open      land in such nations is precious-as are the limited      resources-and has been for centuries.    </p>    <p>      By contrast, the first white settlers in America found a      vast, open wilderness possessing riches beyond imagination.      There seemed to be little need for preservation or      conservation of land, water or other resources. Each new      load of immigrants-unhampered by the traditions which      restricted their brothers back in Europe-were free to      seek their fortunes in almost any way they saw fit. Our way      of life soon became one of "use it up and move away".    </p>    <p>      The advent of the Industrial Revolution-and      particularly the automobile-during our nation's      formative years increased both the speed and scale of this      rapidly developing tradition. High energy consumption      became our mainstay while land, water and natural resources      were destroyed at an ever increasing rate.    </p>    <p>      We became a throwaway society to the point of total      absurdity: Any person could hitch the equivalent of 350      horses to 4,000 pounds of comfort zone (including stereo)      and drive 16 miles to purchase a one-pound loaf of bread or      a one-ounce pin. We even developed throwaway houses (mobile      homes) and no one minded expanding all national and state      highways-at least in part-for their      accommodation. The taxpayers paid for the roads while the      mobile home industry boasted of their products' low prices.    </p>    <p>      As a result of our "live it up" heritage, we find today      that [1] we have enormously wasteful habits (it takes the      equivalent energy of 80 people to support one average      American in his daily life pattern), [2] every aspect of      life in the United States must be reevaluated in terms of      the energy it consumes and [3] as we rush toward the limits      of our natural resources, our system-which is based      on the increasing consumption of such resources-faces      a serious threat of breakdown.    </p>        <p>      Since we have only to look about us to document our      wasteful habits, let us move on to point two of the last      paragraph and evaluate the energy consumed by one segment      of our society. And, since approximately 80% (my own      personal evaluation) of America's energy is wasted in our      urban centers, I find it interesting to compare an      automobile-oriented American metropolitan area to a more      pedestrian-directed European city (see accompanying chart),    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEDESTRIAN VS. AUTOMOBILE CITIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      When we compare the population/land ratios of the San      Francisco Metropolitan Area and the Atlanta Metropolitan      Area to the population/land ratio for Old Paris, we find      that the two American cities consume somewhere between 18      and 70 times more land than the older European city.      Although the actual median of 18 and 70 is 44, let's be      conservative and say that the average U.S. city consumes      only 30 times the amount of land that its European      counterpart needs to house a given population.    </p>    <p>      This, of course, implies that American city      systems-police, fire, transportation,      etc.-cover 30 times the area that similar systems      cover in Europe. Which, obviously, makes them more      expensive to construct and maintain . . . and our taxpayers      have to support that additional burden,    </p>    <p>      There are other implications: The plumbing and wiring      networks in our cities are 30 times as long as they really      need to be. Our children must travel 30 times farther to      school and our workers must go 30 times farther to work. We      might even say that U.S. cities are 30 times less efficient      and 30 times less human than their European counterparts.    </p>    <p>      Perhaps that explains why, without unduly saddling its      citizens with taxes, Paris has developed one of the world's      largest park systems and lined its streets with trees,      fountains and works of art for all-rich or poor-to      enjoy. Or why Paris was able to construct a 105-mile-long      metro system in 1900 and-in 1930-to develop a      central steam heating system for 3/5 of the city (the fuel      is the town's rubbish).    </p>    <p>      And that's not the worst of it (when viewed from our end of      the bargain). For, interestingly enough, if Paris really is      an average of 30 times more land efficient than the average      U.S. city, it may well be <em>100</em> <em>times more      energy efficient</em> due to the fact that some 85% of the      inhabitants of Paris walk, ride the bus or use the metro to      get around. And, when one considers the <em>total</em>      energy system-that is, material extraction for the      production of automobiles; the cost of building and      maintaining roads (which are 10 to 100 times wider than      pedestrian ways) and cars; the enormous cost of      constructing and the uglification of parking facilities:      the loss of recreational, agricultural and living space to      highways; and the pollution which private cars      produce-it's easy to imagine that a      pedestrian-oriented city of Europe could be 1,000 times      more energy efficient than an American town which has      surrendered to the automobile.    </p>    <h3>      WASTE BEGETS WASTE    </h3>    <p>      California, as I'm sure you are aware, has now permitted      40% of that state's fertile valleys to be covered by      suburbia and the attendant highways that attempt to link      work and home. The loss of this agricultural land is felt      by all of us daily here in Atlanta.    </p>    <p>      Which points up another area of enormous national waste in      this country: that is, the way in which we distribute our      food and produce. Just as America cannot permit itself to      become dependent upon foreign oil, neither can Georgia grow      to rely too heavily on California's fruits and vegetables.      Recent truck strikes dramatically illustrated the folly of      placing too much trust on such extended lines of supply.    </p>    <p>      Dr. Erich Farber, Director of the Solar Energy Research      Facility at the University of Florida at Gainesville,      recently found that a carrot traveled 6,000 miles before it      was consumed in Atlanta and that the milk in some local      stores came-refrigerated-all the way from the      city of Cincinnati.    </p>    <p>      Only 20 years ago, the counties surrounding Atlanta were      nearly self-sufficient. Today they're covered with      suburbanites . . . trusting souls completely dependent upon      food and other products produced in distant areas which, in      turn, are largely organized under the same stress pattern.    </p>    <p>      So many states have now moved toward the production of one      or only a few crops that a fairly localized soil failure or      spell of inclement weather or attack of devastating insects      could cripple the nation. This situation cannot long endure      and states-even counties-should immediately      begin to switch back to a more balanced production of food.      As our sources of fuel dry up, today's wasteful      transportation and distribution of the things we eat will      become prohibitively expensive.    </p>    <h3>      NOT ONE CRISIS, BUT MANY    </h3>    <p>      It is obvious-as even this short discussion of the      problem is beginning to illustrate-that the so-called      energy "crisis" is not a separate, isolated or one-time      phenomenon.    </p>    <p>      The very lifeblood of our society has always been a      seemingly endless supply of low-cost energy and other      natural resources. Now (despite repeated warnings over a      long period from numerous environmentalists,      conservationists, analysts, etc.) we "suddenly" are finding      ourselves near the bottom of the richest and most easily      tapped sections of our stockpile. At the very time our      energy sources are drying up, in other words, we need      <em>more</em> <em>and more</em> energy to mine less      accessible minerals, farm increasingly marginal land,      produce more potent fertilizer, operate our continually      sprawling cities, transport raw materials and finished      goods over greater distances, clean up the pollution that      this increasingly intensive activity produces, and so on.    </p>    <p>      As a result, we do not face one single, neat little crisis      (labeled "energy") in America at this time. If we continue      our present course, we're up against potential catastrophe      in, at a minimum, the following areas:    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENERGY BREAKDOWN:</strong> We've already      experienced regional brownouts and spot shortages of      heating and motor fuel. Such disruptions will      occur-sooner or later-on a national scale. As      we become more desperate, we'll eventually invest an      exponential consumption of energy in a frantic search for      new energy . . . leaving ourselves, quite probably, with a      negative gain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RESOURCE DEPLETION:</strong> Our most easily      exploited natural resources have largely been tapped. The      cream has already been-or is currently      being-skimmed away and we face, at best, a future      diet of low-fat milk. The last year has seen supply failing      to meet demand in a number of fields by six months to a      year. Many items are simply "not available until further      notice". The building industry, although depressed, can      look forward only to severe shortages of all supplies . . .      particularly steel, hardwoods, paper, plywood glues and      plastics. A U.S. Geological Survey suggests that new      construction could grind to a virtual halt in this country      as early as 1985 due to a lack of resources.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FOOD SHORTAGES:</strong> We are already seeing an      inflationary rise in the price of food. Next will come a      real shortage with its attendant hoarding and the      stockpiling of weapons for the protection of those hoards.      In a desperate effort to feed ourselves, we'll probably      allow agribusiness to make a last assault on the Great      Plains. This may well result in an almost complete removal      of all plants, trees and animals that we do not consider to      be edible (thanks to pressure from mankind, life forms are      already becoming extinct at a rapidly increasing rate). We      can expect a further "mining" of our soil . . . more severe      flooding and droughts as the land loses the ability to      absorb moisture . . . greater losses to insects, forest      fires and other natural calamities as we intensify the      monoculture of crops.    </p>    <p>      Nor will this steady path downward be confined to the land:      Jacques Cousteau, the noted oceanographer, estimates that      the amount and vitality of marine life off U.S. shores has      been diminished by 50% since 1937. Future pollution and      overfishing will only accelerate this trend and, finally,      result in the extinction of cod, tuna, swordfish, squid,      shrimp and other seafood.    </p>    <h3>      PROFESSOR GEORGE H. RAMSEY VERSUS HIGH-RISE BUILDINGS    </h3>    <p>      Professor Ramsey, author of the accompanying Plowboy Paper,      is certainly no promoter of high-rise buildings. He says      that such structures, as used in their current      architectural and planning form, produce the following ten      undesirable results:    </p>    <p>      [1] They are the helpmate and counterbalance of suburbia.      High-rises and suburbia necessitate each other.    </p>    <p>      [2] High-rise buildings consume 2,000 to 8,000 times more      mechanized energy for their operation and the movement of      people and goods than do three- and four-story walk-ups.      They also have a high thermal loss from the windrake of      their high surfaces.    </p>    <p>      [3] Such structures preclude the use of solar energy on all      buildings which fall within their shadow patterns.    </p>    <p>      [4] High-rises eliminate diversity of people and functions      (such "hindrances to progress" are, of course, removed from      the area before such a building is constructed.)    </p>    <p>      [5] In their final pattern (New York City), high-rise      buildings eliminate all direct sun from the street . . .      thus largely precluding plantlife, shade, light patterns,      oxygen, visual perception and delight on that level.    </p>    <p>      [6] Vertical construction initiates and feeds the land-tax      ripple effect which eventually drives both small business      and the individual homeowner away from the area.    </p>    <p>      [7] High-rises enormously overload all city utilities and      services, particularly the street, water and sewage      systems. To cover 85% of the remaining area of a city with      concrete (for parking, etc.) is an insult bordering on      criminality to both land and people.    </p>    <p>      [8] Building vertically helps create high crime areas due      to the evacuation of workers every weekday evening at 5      p.m. One invariably finds both high poverty and crime areas      adjacent to new high-rise complexes.    </p>    <p>      [9] High-rises deplete the city tax base. Such structures      do not pay enough taxes to cover the additional strain they      put on city services. Case Documentation: San Francisco.    </p>    <p>      [10] High-rise buildings are a bore. If you've seen the 4th      floor of one, you've seen the 24th floor. Case Study      Documentation: <em>The Ultimate High-rise</em> by Bruce      Brugmann, Greggar Sletteland and the <em>Bay Guardian</em>      staff.    </p>    <p>      <strong>POLLUTION:</strong> Today's spreading oil,      pesticide, insecticide, herbicide, detergent and other      stains will continue to spread in the future. As will the      land-, air- and water-contaminating wastes from our cities.      Already dangerous levels of lead, chlorinated hydrocarbons      and other pollutants in mother's (and other) milk will keep      on rising. The nitrate poisoning of our water supplies      (from massive agribiz crop injections of nitrogen      fertilizer) will become an even greater problem tomorrow      than it is today. We can look forward to more and bigger      spills of nuclear waste. If we continue our present course,      all the rivers will eventually foam and the lakes die.      There will be no insects, no birds, no fish, no forests, no      animals, no life. All will be quite "clean".    </p>    <p>      <strong>ECONOMIC FAILURE:</strong> Our current rate of      inflation will accelerate and the dollar will almost      certainly be devalued against gold . . . not once, but many      times. Look for a decline in the stock market of over 200      points in less than a year. Interest rates will rise to      12%. We'll have a national annual deficit of 500 billion      dollars.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COMPLETE URBAN BREAKDOWN:</strong> Enormous      blighted areas stretch for miles upon miles in Detroit,      Chicago, St. Louis, Philadelphia, New York, Newark, etc.      The exodus of people and businesses from our cities to ever      growing peripheral circles is expanding at a national rate      of one mile of radius per year . . . leaving behind all      accumulated municipal wealth: libraries, schools, theaters,      courthouses, parks, etc. The remaining vacuum of 85%      asphalt jungle is for those who cannot escape . . . their      lives are to transpire between super expressways, parking      lots, condemned buildings and old movie houses, while the      escapees are astonished at the crime rate of those too poor      to escape. Entire metropolitan areas have been left without      a tax base to maintain city streets or provide adequate      police or fire protection. This is not to mention the      complete lack of urban space, sidewalk cafes, fountains,      sculpture or simply a decent, pleasant, quiet place to be.    </p>    <h3>      THE SOLUTION TO THESE PROBLEMS IS NOT:    </h3>    <p>      <strong>THE ALASKAN PIPELINE:</strong> It will take an      enormous amount of materials and energy to develop the      pipeline and the North Slope oil field which it will tap .      . . an oil field which, if it were the sole source of      petroleum for the U.S., would last a mere three years. An      oil spill anywhere along the proposed pipeline will result      in a larger petroleum-caused destruction of land and      animals than any to date.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MASSIVE DEVELOPMENT OF NUCLEAR POWER:</strong> The      fabrication of approximately 20 nuclear power plants per      state, as the Atomic Energy Commission now plans, will be a      disaster. Even if such a system can be made      fail-safe-which it cannot unless a miracle positively      does away with sabotage, war, homemade atomic bombs and the      slightest imperfection in the cooling and storage of      radioactive materials-the enormous cost of the undertaking      will be a tremendous burden on the taxpayers of this      country. And, even if the nuclear generation of power does      work as perfectly as planned, it will create an      astronomical amount of absolutely deadly radioactive waste      that-as Dave Brower, head of Friends of the Earth      says-will be around five times as long into the      future as recorded history goes into the past. This is a      terribly dangerous legacy to leave to our children and our      children's children and the generations which-we      hope-will follow.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STRIP MINING:</strong> The strip mining of five      states-as proposed by "rational" politicians and      energy company officials-to provide energy for the      remaining 45 is no answer either. We simply can't afford      the loss of cropland and living space. And, besides, what      will we do when the stripable fuel is gone? Many of our      synthetic products (and there's not enough natural ones to      go around anymore) are derived from coal and oil and gas.      Burning the last of the fossil fuels will preclude their      use.    </p>    <h3>      ALL RIGHT THEN, WHAT <em>CAN</em> WE DO?    </h3>    <p>      The preceding part of this address suggests insurmountable      problems and, certainly, there is no easy way out of the      bottomless pit into which we now plunge. Still, if we're      willing to make the effort-and it will have to be a      large one-we may yet have a faint hope of altering      our destiny.    </p>    <h3>      U.S. CITIES DO NOT<em>HAVE TO</em>BE BAD    </h3>    <p>      Although most past and present urban areas in the United      States "just kind of happened" and-if planned at      all-have been based on the false assumption that we'd      always have unlimited energy and other natural resources,      there is no reason for future towns to make the same      mistake.    </p>    <p>      As a matter of fact, several very recent examples of what a      U.S. town can be have already begun to map out dramatically      more satisfying and ecologically sound ideas for a      community. Leading this new trend is "Coldspring", a      village of 12,800 people in 3,780 units on 370 acres. The      town, designed by Moshe Safdie and currently under      construction within the city of Baltimore, will be      essentially pedestrian with only one road crossing its      enormous tract of land. All breadwinners will work within      walking distance of their homes, children will walk safely      to school and local markets and boutiques will provide      pedestrian shopping without the unnerving experience of      driving and the resulting assault of pollution.    </p>    <p>      I believe we will have a much healthier and happier America      if we apply, on a large scale, some of the guiding      principles behind Coldspring and her sister villages. We      must:    </p>    <p>      <strong>ACTIVELY REDUCE CONSUMPTION AND WASTE.</strong> In      the planning and operation of our urban areas and      throughout the rest of our society.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ESTABLISH PRIORITIES FOR THE USE OF ENERGY AND      OTHER RESOURCES.</strong> The public, business, the      professions and government must be coordinated in this      undertaking. State land use policies must be established to      ensure the preservation of town sites and agricultural and      recreational acreage.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOP URBAN SPRAWL.</strong> Either through      designating land use (see above) or establishing legal      limits to the size of our cities. Greenbelt peripheries      should be provided around our urban areas.    </p>    <p>      <strong>STOP MAN'S ASSAULT UPON NATURE.</strong> We must      redirect all new urban development to the already blighted      areas of the inner city while establishing central city      open spaces, parks, good schools and quiet. Roads and      parking should be eliminated wherever possible and only      service vehicles allowed into these new areas. High-rises,      which have very poor energy performance records, should be      kept to an absolute minimum. Building heights, in general,      should be limited to three- and four-story walk-ups . . .      thus eliminating elevators and simultaneously permitting      the sun to reach street level for plant growth and the      general health of the population.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INTRODUCE ENERGY AND URBAN IMPACT STUDIES FOR ALL      NEW BUILDINGS.</strong> That is, if a building-even a one-      or two-story, solar-heated structure-is placed so      that its usage requires long-distance travel in privately      owned vehicles by the public, it would not receive a      construction permit.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENCOURAGE MIXED ZONING.</strong> Travel (which      directly consumes large quantities of energy), pollution      and crime can all be reduced by mixed zoning which places a      housing unit within walking distance of every anticipated      new business or light industry employee. Light industries      and businesses can also be encouraged to move into existing      bedroom communities. If such production facilities are made      attractive and non-polluting and are provided with little      or no parking, their installation would service the      immediate neighborhood rather than the city at large.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DIRECT NEW GROWTH TO NATURAL SITES OF      BEAUTY.</strong> New villages and towns must be prohibited      from agricultural land, they must be completely planned and      their size must be limited. They can either have mixed      employment or be dependent upon a major industry. Land      surrounding new towns should be maintained for agriculture      and recreation. The villages should be essentially designed      for pedestrian traffic and leased cars can be provided for      unusually long trips out of town.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IMMEDIATELY BEGIN BICYCLE PATHS THROUGHOUT OUR      MAJOR CITIES.</strong> Studies have shown that as many as      20% of Americans would enjoy bicycling to work if they were      provided with safe trails that were separate from      automobile movements . . . or with streets reserved for      bikes only, except for the cars of people living on those      streets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>EMPLOY ALL-NATURAL ENERGY SYSTEMS.</strong> Solar,      wind, water, tidal, methane . . . every possible      non-polluting source of energy must be tested      and-whenever possible-used in preference to      fossil fuels, nuclear power and other polluting sources.    </p>    <h3>      CONCLUSION    </h3>    <p>      We can either intelligently go about saving and elongating      the use of energy and resources in the United States or we      can continue our present course until there is little      remaining. Our decision will accurately define our concern      for the nation and our children.    </p>
