        [13] To make the modification process simpler, the carburetor should first be cleaned in solvent, then disassembled into its three main parts (air horn, main body, throttle body). The parts that get removed in the course of the operation are, from left to right, the entire secondary linkage unit (and choke rod) . . . both secondary main discharge nozzles, main well air bleed tubes, and accelerator tubes (center: top and bottom) . . . the secondary metering rods, their two-part lever, and a mounting screw and hinge pin (middle center) . . . the secondary bore baffle . . . and a 1-1/2""-diameter section of the main body's rear wall. [14] With the air horn inverted, remove the brass air bleed and accelerator tubes from both sides of the secondary circuit.
