            		    <p>      The idea of recycling stockings certainly isn't new, but      here are several unique projects that may help you actually      enjoy the otherwise "darn" dull job of dealing with      battered footwear.    </p>        <h5 id="byline">by       Barbara Casper    </h5>        <p>      Suppose a friend called to inform you of a surprise baby      shower . . . or your mate suggested an impromptu visit to      your sister's family . . . or the youngsters came in from      playing in the snow, rummaged through their bureaus, and      informed you that there wasn't a dry mitten in the house.      Would you worry because you're too short on fends to buy a      gift for the shower . . . or to purchase a small token of      affection for your nieces and nephews? Do you perhaps lack      the knitting skill necessary to keep your family supplied      with low-cost mittens?    </p>    <p>      Well, I used to feel a pang of panic in such situations,      but now I just confidently head for my darning basket and      retrieve all the old socks I can find. Then, an hour or two      later, I'll have a passel of newly stitched clothing . . .      to offer as gifts or to supplement my own children's      wardrobes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BOOTEE BASICS</strong>    </p>    <p>      To stitch up a pair of infant foot-warmers (which would be      a welcome gift at just about any baby shower), you'll need      a pair of adult-sized crew-neck socks, a scrap of material,      and a bit of ribbon or yarn. Begin (keeping in mind that      you'll need to perform each step twice to make a pair of      bootees) by cutting a sock just below the ribbing, forming      a curved toe (see Fig. 1).    </p>    <p>      Next, cut a strip of fabric that's 1" wide and long enough      to form a border around the top of the ribbing (be sure to      allow for some overlap when you measure it). Then fold      under the raw edges of the material, and stitch the strip      to the <em>inside</em> of the sock . . . overlapping the      fabric where its ends meet. The resulting band folds down      to form a cuff (as shown in Fig. 2).    </p>    <p>      With that done, trace the outline of the bootee's toe, add      a seam allowance to this curve, and cut a half-circle of      fabric to match. With the <em>right</em> side of the scrap      facing out, stitch the half-round (folding its raw edges      under as you go) to the <em>upper</em> layer of sock      material.    </p>    <p>      Now, cut another 1"-wide strip of fabric that's long enough      to encase the toe of the bootee, and secure it in place,      being sure to stitch through <em>all</em> the thicknesses      of the cloth and the sock. (This forms a "bumper" at the      tip of the shoe.)    </p>    <p>      Finally, weave a length of ribbon or braided yarn through      the ribbed portion of the sock, just above the baby's      ankle, to form a tie.    </p>    <p>      These bootees will not only be warm, but also have the      capability of "growing" with the child . . . because as the      tot's foot gets larger, Mom or Dad can simply move the tie      higher.    </p>        <p>      <strong>MITTENS IN MINUTES</strong>    </p>    <p>      If warm hands are what your youngsters are clamoring for,      you can easily stitch up enough mittens so there'll always      be a dry pair to replace those that soak through (in the      process of winning snowball fights and such). To tackle      this project, you'll need one crew-neck sock for each      mitten (wool is best), some elastic thread, and a few      strands of colorful yarn (if you'd like to embroider the      handwear).    </p>    <p>      Start by making a curved cut across the sock below the neck      (the distance will depend on the size of your child's hand)      as you did when making the bootees. Be sure to save the      excess material . . . you'll use some of it later on. (If      it's necessary to shorten the glove, do that now.) Next,      make a slit - to accommodate the thumb -      starting from the cut end of the sock, as shown in Fig. 3.    </p>    <p>      Once that's taken care of, I generally spend a few moments      embroidering designs on the main part of the mitten (you      could add the decoration after the glove is completed if      you'd prefer), making sure, as I do so, that the thumb      incision faces <em>right</em> on one and <em>left</em> on      the other of a pair. A simple, bright design adds an      attractive - and durable - trim.    </p>        <p>      The next step will be to fabricate the thumb. To do so, cut      a hooklike section, of the appropriate length and width,      from the leftover sock material (I told you it'd come in      handy!), as shown in Fig. 4. Then open the thumb up and pin      its base to the top of the mitten slit, making certain that      the right sides of the fabric are facing each other. Stitch      these pieces together, overcast the seam edges to prevent      the knitted material from unraveling, and turn the mitten      wrong side out to complete the stitching and overcasting.      Finally, while the mitt is still inside out, weave in an      elastic thread at the wrist (see Fig. 5) and knot it.    </p>    <p>      Now, repeat the whole process with the second sock . . .      turn the cozy warmers right side out . . . and let your      child wear them with pride!    </p>    <p>      <strong>STITCH A TURTLENECK SHIRT</strong>    </p>    <p>      My children always seem to be growing out of their      clothing, so I try to keep a step ahead by anticipating      their needs ... and (of course!) recycling socks in the      process.    </p>    <p>      To whip up a turtleneck shirt, you'll need a pair of      crew-neck socks, about half a yard of stretchy knit fabric      (the amount will vary, depending on your child's size), and      a pattern. (You can purchase the last item, but I find that      it's just as simple - and far less expensive -      to trace my own from another shirt of the desired      dimensions.)    </p>    <p>      After transferring the pattern to the cloth, cut the knit      material into four sections: the front, the back, and two      arms. That done, slice <em>straight</em> across each sock      just below the ribbing. Then measure 3 inches up the ribbed      section and cut again. This will give you two 3"-wide      pieces (to use as cuffs) and two larger, top-of-the-sock      sections (for the collar). Cut the latter pieces so that      each is in the form of a flat rectangle, rather than a      tube.    </p>    <p>      Then, with the right side of the shirt front and the      <em>wrong</em> side of the sock rectangle together, sew the      ribbing to the neck of the shirt, stretching the sock      material slightly as needed. Once that's done, repeat the      procedure - using the other rectangle - to form      the shirt back, and overcast all the seams to prevent      unraveling.    </p>        <p>      Next, with <em>right</em> sides facing, stitch the collar      together at the side seams to form the actual turtleneck.      Now,aurn the garment wrong side out and sew up the shoulder      seams (see Fig. 6).    </p>    <p>      If the shirt material has plenty of "give", you can skip      this paragraph and go on to the next step. But if you've      used a minimum-stretch fabric, you may want to add an      opening at the back of the pullover that will make it      easier for the child to put on and take off. To do so, slit      the turtleneck down the back and cut a couple of inches on      down into the shirt, as shown in Fig. 7. Then fold the      right sides of each collar half together, stitch the ragged      edges shut, and turn the <em>right</em> sides out. Next,      cut a piece of shirt fabric that's approximately 1" wide      and 4" long (a bias strip will work best). With the right      sides together, stitch this scrap down one side of the cut      and up the other. Turn the facing to the inside, tuck the      raw edge under, and sew again. Finish this portion of the      job by attaching loops and buttons to the collar opening.    </p>    <p>      Once the neck is completed, turn the garment inside out      and- - with right sides together - attach the      arms to the shirt. Then stitch the side seams and the      underarm junctions.    </p>    <p>      With that out of the way, go on to fold the 3" sock      sections (which you've reserved for the cuffs) in half, and      attach them to the arms (as in Fig. 6), making certain      - before you do so - that the right sides of      the fabric are together. Finally, machine-hem the shirt      bottom and overcast any raw edges.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A HANDMADE HEAD-WARMER</strong>    </p>    <p>      Hats are a wintertime must up here in Maine, and it's      always good to have a few extras on hand.    </p>    <p>      You'll need one pair of socks and some decorative yarn to      make a child-sized "stocking cap". Begin by cutting the      socks off just below the crew necks, as you did when making      the turtleneck shirt. Then slit each tube open and sew the      resulting rectangles - right sides together -      around the three cut edges, leaving about an inch open at      the bottom of the seam on each side. Now, overcast the seam      . . . turn the cap right side out . . . flip the 1" brim up      . . . and hand-stitch its seams closed.    </p>        <p>      Next, gather the top of the hat in an X-pattern (as shown      in Fig. 8) and fasten a yarn pom-pom in place. Use a few      more scraps of yarn to make a pair of braided ties, and      then set these fastenings aside for the moment.    </p>    <p>      Now, find the foot portions of the socks and cut a      half-circle, with its diameter <em>on the fold</em> , in      each one. These will serve as ear flaps (see the photo), so      adjust their size to the ears in question. Fold each flap      with its right side in . . . put one of the braided ties      between the halves so that just its tip protrudes at the      centerpoint of the curve . . . and stitch around the      semicircle, leaving a small opening at the end of the seam      so that you can turn the half-moon right side out. Attach      the earmuff to the inside of the hat, just above the fold      of the brim.    </p>    <p>      As a last step, embroider a design on the cap if you like,      then tie it to your tot's chilly head.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SCRAP TOGETHER A SCARF</strong>    </p>    <p>      By now you've probably completed quite a collection of      children's clothing, but you may be wondering what to do      with the unused sock <em>feet</em> that are beginning to      pile up. Well, ponder no longer . . . simply sew the extras      into a warm scarf.    </p>    <p>      To make a child-sized muffler, you'll need the arch      sections from at least five pairs of socks. They don't need      to match (in fact, a variety of colors makes for a more      attractive scarf).    </p>        <p>      Cut the heel and toe from each sock, leaving a tubular      section. Turn one of these arch portions wrong side out and      pull it over a right-side-out one (see Fig. 9). Stitch one      end closed (through all thicknesses), overcast the seam,      and turn the outer tube right side out again . . . thus      forming two joined scarf links. Repeat this process until      all the pieces are attached.    </p>    <p>      If decoration is desired, you can embroider the end squares      (see Fig. 9). Then fold the raw edges under . . .      hand-stitch the end seams shut . . . and add fringe to      complete the scarf.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DESIGN YOUR OWN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Once you've made a few of the projects described in this      article, you'll likely think of additional items that can      be made from old socks. Some of my other favorites include      drawstring bags, new feet for old pajamas, cuffs for worn      coats, a tube top for summer wear, a cold-weather face      mask, potholders, stuffed draft stoppers, an eyeglass case,      a shoe polisher, and a washcloth (filled with bits of      soap). In fact, recycled socks are in such demand at our      house that I'm tempted to give up darning for good!    </p>
