                    <p>      <strong>WHOEVER YOU ARE, WHEREVER YOU ARE, TAKE TO THESE      THOUGHTS WITH CARE. THEY COME FROM MANY DIFFERENT PLACES      AND FROM ONE PLACE AT THE SAME TIME.</strong></p>		    <p>      Most scientists know what needs to be done to save our      Earth. But the politicians don't listen to them. They will      listen to popular pressure; the people got to supply that.    </p>    <p>      -PETER SEEGER<br />      <em>Folksinger</em>    </p>    <p>      We are hopeful that you will want to visit our planet in      the near future. We are in the process of restoring our      environment to its original grandeur, and hope to have      completed the task before your RSVP.    </p>    <p>      -JEREMY RIFKIN<br />      <em>Greenhouse Crisis Foundation</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We could have saved it, but we were too damned      cheap.</strong>    </p>    <p>      -KURT VONNEGUT<br />      <em>NOVELIST</em>    </p>    <h3>ATTENTION: NEED ORIENTATION SOONEST</h3>    <p>      To be alive on this planet is to be oriented. Plants will      twist into contortions to achieve proper alignment with      their source of energy. A cat, after falling to the ground,      will immediately recalculate its coordinates. A hospital      patient, after regaining consciousness, will always ask,      "Where am I?"    </p>    <p>      Good question. Human beings ask the same question about all      basic orientations-about love, family, work, status,      meaning, eternity. The answers are increasingly unclear.      The conditions of modern life are now disorienting, and      therein lies the human dilemma.    </p>    <p>      The human species began wandering the African savanna 5      million years ago. For most of that time, it was not a      remarkable species. It was comparatively slow, weak, and      vulnerable. Its only advantage was social cohesion, which      was dependent on its ability to generate signs and symbols      and communicate meanings and memories.    </p>    <p>      <em>I hear the Earth singing on its spindle the sacred      incantations of the celestial spheres-do you?</em>    </p>    <p>      -LINN BARNES<br />      <em>Lutenist and composer</em>    </p>    <p>      From these accidental and bare beginnings, humans slowly      learned to elaborate on the rudiments of culture. Culture      itself began to evolve. Sophisticated cultures drove simple      cultures into extinction. Today, the most advanced human      cultures evolve so efficiently, so powerfully, and so      rapidly that mere biological evolution is rendered      irrelevant. Cultural change now determines the human      condition. The recent acceleration of cultural evolution,      particularly its information component, has brought      confusion and dislocation in its wake.    </p>    <p>      The human repertoire of biological      attributes-especially the brain, glands, and      senses-is still oriented toward survival on the      savanna. It is poorly designed for coping with the      complexity, turbulence, and speed of its cultural      inventions. In short, the human species is dis-oriented;      and the result is wholesale retreat into mental illness,      obsessions, addictions, brutality,      indifference-anything that provides escape from the      chaos of disorientation. At the moment of triumph, this      dominant species threatens its own existence, using the      means of victory to fashion destruction. Modem culture is      destructive of the most basic orientations. Without such      orientations, life itself is impossible.    </p>    <p>      -DOUGLASS LEA<br />      <em>Writer and gardener</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WE HUMANS</strong>have spread over our planet's      surface, and some, like my ancestors, have even settled on      tiny islands lost in the immensity of the seas that cover      much of our globe. But in our rush to subdue nature,      multiply our numbers, and fill our lives with comfort, we      have fouled our nest.    </p>    <p>      To reverse this awful process, we need to remember our      natural origins and relearn how to respect nature. We      Polynesians believe that the earth, being the great mother      Papa-honua-moku, is sacred, and that the sky above, being      of masculine identity, is the great father Wakea. He is the      atmosphere and the light, while Papa is the rock, the land.      We humans and all forms of life flow from their union.    </p>    <p>      The love of our eternal parents, Earth Mother and Sky      Father, is all-embracing and will continue to provide for      us, but only if we respect the earth, the sky, and the      waters that mediate between them. We need to harness our      science and technology to protect the domains of Papa and      Wakea, not desecrate them.    </p>    <p>      -KAWENA JOHNSON<br />      <em>Native Hawaiian environmentalist and spiritual      Leader</em>    </p>    <h3>DEAR MADAM, SIR, OR WHATEVER RURAL ROUTE I, OUTER      SPACE</h3>    <p>      First I want to congratulate your linguistic experts for      the ease with which they translated my message into your      native tongue. Our experts could never have accomplished      anything like that so quickly, if at all. Obviously you      beings have benefited enormously from being able to      eavesdrop on our radio and television programs for so many      years.    </p>    <p>      I hope you won't take offense at my presuming to give your      citizens some good advice. It is this: For heaven's sake,      don't foul up your own spaceship as we have the Spaceship      Earth. Just a few hundred years ago, our ship was clean,      pure, and beautiful. Now it's a dreadful mess. We hope to      change that. But remember: The most important thing you can      do is to imbue your children's consciousness with a      conservation ethic to guide them in their<br />      dealings with nature. We didn't do that.    </p>    <p>      We have been exploiters without such a guiding ethic.      Several years ago Joseph Wood Krutch pretty well summarized      the extent of our anemic conservation ethic when he wrote,      "If people destroy something replaceable made by mankind,      they are called vandals; If they destroy something      irreplaceable made by God, they are called developers."    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't follow our example. We hope to rectify our      mistake beginning on Earth Day 1990. Wish us well.</em>    </p>    <p>      Until we meet, best regards,<br />      -GAYLORD NELSON<br />      <em>Founder of Earth Day</em>    </p>    <p>      This year marks the first step towards political      self-determination for the nations in Eastern Europe and      the Baltic states. Although it will take time to overcome      the extensive psychological damage wrought by 45 years of      Stalinist terror on our people, the hearts of all Estonians      around the world are reaching out to a future of renewed      hope for a united mankind, living in harmony with each      other and with the planet Earth. We are all in the process      of growing towards the light.    </p>    <p>      -LINDA PAKRI<br />      <em>Estonian~Canadian stage director</em>    </p>    <p>      We are sentient beings who live on a small and lovely      planet graced with a hospitable climate, an abundance of      water, and gravity enough to hold in place a mantle of      life-giving air. Our planet is, from what we can tell, a      rare oasis in the vastness of space, a place where      life-forms of incredible number and variety can arise,      grow, and evolve.    </p>    <p>      During our relatively brief time on earth, we have lived      with great intensity and have created much that is      beautiful and grand. But we have also raised up an      artificial and toxic environment that threatens nature      itself. While our greatest poets have told us that love is      what moves the sun and the other stars, it is ambition,      greed, and war that dominate the pages of our daily press,      and our history books as well. Clearly, our knowledge, no      matter how puny when viewed against the vastness of the      universe, still far outstrips our wisdom.    </p>    <p>      How, then, could we presume to send a message to the      unknown reaches of space? Who would hear us? Who would      care?    </p>    <p>      But wait! There is something about our species that might      yet redeem us here on Earth and grant us a larger destiny      in worlds beyond our own: We began our journey on this      planet in societies so simple and unadorned as to possess      no clothing other than the loincloth, no tool other than      the stick or stone, no permanent dwelling place, no carving      or other plastic art. Still, the brain of our primitive      ancestors was no different from the modem brain. It was      capable of understanding calculus, playing a Chopin sonata,      flying a jet. Nor is this surplus brain power even      beginning to be used up. The creative capacity of the human      brain is, for all practical purposes, infinite. At essence,      we are mostly unused capacity.    </p>    <p>      <em>I suppose the universe will last longer than an oak      tree or a wooden desk, so I want to carve this:</em>      "Dolly, I love you. Elbs.    </p>    <p>      (FULL NAME WITHHELD)    </p>    <p>      Here, then, is perhaps the most profound mystery on this      planet: Why this surplus human capacity? What is its      ultimate purpose? Will it be used for good or evil? What      worlds will we build, what vast range of experience will we      explore?    </p>    <p>      Our potential defines our quest. The odds are long, the      outcome far from certain. But there is still the      possibility that we shall eventually travel to the stars      and add the best of what is still latent within us to      realms that now exist only in our illimitable imagination.    </p>    <p>      -George Leonard<br />      <em>Author</em>    </p>    <p>      Our planet is dying. And unless we pull together to reverse      this hideous trend our children and our grandchildren      are<br />      doomed.    </p>    <p>      -ANN LANDERS<br />      <em>Syndicated personal columnist</em>    </p>    <p>      Help;<br />      A shipwrecked sailor marooned on a desert island would send      a message for help by sealing a note in a bottle and      tossing it into the ocean, in hopes it will drift into the      hands of his rescuers. A message broadcast into space on      Earth Day is the same thing, and this is what I want to say      to our rescuers:    </p>    <p>      Greetings from Earth. If you have been here earlier, you      would not recognize the place now. If you haven't, I would      like to give you a brief rundown on who we are and what we      have become.    </p>    <p>      A lot has changed since the early days when we were tribal      and used a lot more common sense in our daily routine. Too      much knowledge has been transformed into arrogance. We are      too messy and won't clean up after ourselves. It is hard      for a lot of people to see the ancient constellations in      the night sky, because the air is dirty. We are in too much      of a hurry and think that money and power are more      important than happiness.<br />      <br />      We have not been very good tenants.<br />      Our children may save us if they are taught to care      properly for the planet; but if not, it may be back to the      Ice Age or the caves from where we first emerged. Then      we'll have to view the universe above from a cold, dark      place. No more jet skis, nuclear weapons, plastic crap,      broken pay phones, drugs, cars, waffle irons, or      television. Come to think of it, that might not be a bad      idea.    </p>    <p>      -JIMMY BUFFET<br />      <em>Songwriter</em>    </p>    <p>      There is no way that a human being can see a real leaf when      all leaves are gone, and it is impossible to envisage the      loss to the human soul when the only leaves are plastic      replicas of an organism that used to obey its own laws,      which are the laws of God.    </p>    <p>      No substitution is possible, or ever will be.    </p>    <p>      -JAMES DICKEY<br />      <em>Poet and novelist</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>WELL I DONT KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE GOD PUTS TIME ON      FAST FORWARD WHEN YOU GET OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL THIS TIME LAST      YEAR . . . BEST WE COULD WITH WHAT WE HAD HOPE YOU CAN READ      THIS WRITING</strong>    </p>    <p>      -REGARDS TO NATALIE WOOD<br />      ROBERT ASHLEY<br />      <em>Composer<br />      © 1990</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong><em>Warning: Stay away.</em></strong>Planet      dominated by extremely primitive societies. Rudimentary      civilizations now evolving, but outcome is uncertain. Try      back in 10,000 years.    </p>    <p>      -MARVIN HARRIS<br />      <em>Anthropologist</em>    </p>    <p>      Man on Earth becomes aware that he himself is the most      disastrous pest that ever devastated this planet. Man      starts to recede behind environmental barriers so that      Earth can regenerate.    </p>    <p>      The forthcoming treaty with nature will englobe:    </p>    <p>      <em>A waste-free society<br />      Tolerance of spontaneous vegetation<br />      Man restores to nature the territories<br />      that he has illegally occupied.<br />      Fulfilling cosmic law: All that is<br />      horizontal under the sky belongs<br />      to nature.<br />      Roofs will be forests, highways will<br />      become woodlands. Man creates<br />      habitat for nature.<br />      Man learns the language of nature<br />      to communicate with her.<br />      The creations of man will match the<br />      creations of nature.<br />      Man has everything to be happy on this Earth.<br />      We have snow and every day a new morning.<br />      We have trees and rain, hope and tears,<br />      We have humus and oxygen, animals and plants<br />      In all colors. We have distant lands,<br />      Sun and shadow. We are rich.</em>    </p>    <p>      -HUNDERTWASSER<br />      <em>Artist</em>    </p>    <p>      Theology, philosophy, and science all speak of a harmonious      universe, of a "cosmos" endowed with its own integrity, its      own internal, dynamic balance. This order must be      respected. The human race is called to explore this order,      to examine it with due care, and to make use of it while      safeguarding its integrity.    </p>    <p>      . . . the seriousness of the ecological issue lays bare the      depth of man's moral crisis. If an appreciation of the      value of the human person and of human life is lacking, we      will also lose interest in others and in the earth itself.      Simplicity, moderation, and discipline, as well as a spirit      of sacrifice, must become a part of everyday life, lest all      suffer the negative consequences of the careless habits of      a few.    </p>    <p>      An education in ecological responsibility is urgent:      responsibility for oneself, for others, and for the earth.      This education cannot be rooted in mere sentiment or empty      wishes. Its purpose cannot be ideological or political. It      must not be based on a rejection of the modem world or a      vague desire to return to some "paradise lost." Instead, a      true education in responsibility entails a genuine      conversion in ways of thought and behavior. Churches and      religious bodies, nongovernmental and governmental      organizations, indeed all members of society, have a      precise role to play in such education. The first educator,      however, is the family, where the child learns to respect      his neighbor and to love nature.    </p>    <p>      -JOHN PAUL II    </p>    <p>      Love is a lie, until you prove it to be true. Marriage is a      lie until you prove it to be true. Earth care is a lie,      too, until you prove it true. Indeed, everything is little      more than a promise to behave. The future is a promise we      can make behave. We can even make it cave in on us if we      want.    </p>    <p>      -RAY BRADBURY<br />      <em>Author</em>    </p>    <h3>THE DEVIL DOES THE NORTH</h3>    <p>      "Behave or I will take you to the hairy white man!" was one      way my mother used to ensure we obeyed, and to a      six-year-old Eskimo boy in 1956, any person with hairy      arms, a pale, colorless, hairy face, and strange habits and      language, was enough to stop me from misbehaving and to      start thinking of what demon spirit was personified in our      community, which consisted of one family of five, two      qablunaat (white men), one Hudson's Bay Company clerk, and      one Roman Catholic priest.    </p>    <p>      <em>Yesterday's weirdness is tomorrow's reason why.</em>    </p>    <p>      -DR. HUNTER S. THOMPSON<br />      <em>Author</em>    </p>    <p>      I was born in an igloo in Repulse Bay in the Canadian      Arctic. Other than the fear of being taken to the white man      and of the fires of hell the priest talked about, there was      not much else to fear while riding with the family on the      dogsled with only the sound of Husky dogs panting as they      crisscrossed their lines in the fan-hitch style over the      hard-packed snow. Destruction of the environment was      unheard of; however, preservation of nature was taught even      then: Don't camp in one spot for more than three years, so      you don't destroy the land; don't give sickness beings      (germs) time to settle, and so on.    </p>    <p>      Now, just 39 years later, I find it hard to believe that I      am sitting here in front of a computer, aware that CFCs are      destroying our skies and that oil spills, PCBs, and other      toxic wastes are destroying our precious seas. I'm also      aware of the effect that misinterpretation of the "science      and mathematics" culture (fads and greed) has on our      people's children, who will not be able to share our world      of nature with their children.    </p>    <p>      I teach my children and my people about not being alone in      trying to save the world, about how millions of people      south, north, east, and west of our small population      genuinely care about nature and humans just as our      forefathers did.    </p>    <p>      You see, Eskimo hunters, too, are countryfolk who care      about the preservation of their lands and livestock (the      caribou) here in the barren lands of short summers and      -50° winters. But the cold does not stop the      destructive forces of the never-ending search for fuel and      nuclear weapons. And I can assure you that, unlike what the      Roman Catholic priest taught us, hell is not necessarily      fire: For even in the cold Arctic, God's great works are      destroyed, and that is also hell.    </p>    <p>      Peace be with you,<br />      JOSIE KUSUGAK<br />      <em>Rankin Inlet, Northwest Territories<br /></em> XoC oGo    </p>    <p>      The rain forest has plants and animals found nowhere else      in the world. It has medicines found nowhere else. It also      helps us breathe.    </p>    <p>      -MICHAEL KRAMER<br />      <em>Thirst grade<br />      Davenport Ridge School, Stamford, CT</em>    </p>    <p>      Often in human history, crises have served as the impetus      necessary to propel humanity forward in its development.      The fact that so many people from all over the world are      taking heed is proof that environment is the crisis of our      time, and that it is playing the role of stress necessary      to thrust us into a new and higher order of development. In      a very real sense, our pathology is our opportunity.    </p>    <p>      -H.E. YOWERI KAGUTA MUSEVENI<br />      <em>President of Uganda</em>    </p>    <p>      I want to say hello to my great-, great-, great-,      greatgrandchildren and let them know some of what I either      loved or admired: tulip trees, the Sahara Desert, the      Golden Gate Bridge, dew, great horned owls, Shakespeare's      history plays, sauerkraut, river islands, Mozart, this one      woman a long time ago, my son, and the capacity in human      beings for healing.    </p>    <p>      -ALFRED MEYER<br />      <em>(personal communication)</em>    </p>    <p>      The Quran states that human beings are God's vicegerents on      Earth. It is therefore incumbent upon them to care for and      to protect the natural environment which God has created      and sustained and which reveals at every turn the glory of      His creative power.    </p>    <p>      -SEYYED HOSSEIN HASR<br />      <em>Islamic scholar</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>We have to start cleaning up our own spirits before we      can start cleaning up this land.</em>    </p>    <p>      -ROLLING THUNDER    </p>
