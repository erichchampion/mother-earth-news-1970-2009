                <p>      <strong>REPORTS FROM AMERICA</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>The wild energies of a slippery foothold</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by John Poppy    </h5>        <p>      <em>When any disaster threatens, and you've had ample      warning, the question becomes: What do you save?</em>    </p>    <p>      <strong>SAN ANSELMO, CA-</strong><em>One warm evening      a couple of summers ago, Julia and I looked up at the ridge      across the wooded canyon our house is built on and saw a      red glow that shouldn't have been</em> there. The sun had      gone behind the hill to our right, leaving just the      deepening blues and greens of dusk.    </p>    <p>      "That's a fire," she said. "Oh, damn."    </p>    <p>      Julia went to the telephone to make sure the neighbors      knew. I climbed to the roof with a hose, hating to waste      water but aiming to wet down some surfaces. Here in      northern California we were in the middle of a three-year      drought, and voluntary cutbacks on water use would soon      roll over into enforced rationing. Every living thing in      the canyon was crackling dry. If the fire blew downhill to      the bottom, it would surely race up our side and turn the      house to ash and smoke. No amount of wetting down would      save it in such a fire storm, but spraying had quenched      embers dropped on us by the last fire nearby.    </p>    <p>      "This may be melodramatic, but I'm going to pack some      things in the car in case we have to run," Julia called      from the deck. We heard the pumpers growl as the blaze      roared higher. This was no brushfire; somebody's house was      burning. I gave the roof and deck a last spray and climbed      down to get in on the decision making. What was Julia      packing? A few days' worth of comfortable clothes. Photo      albums. Twenty-four years of diaries. Her tiny handful of      jewelry.    </p>    <p>      I tried to decide what was both portable, besides the      obvious clothes, and irreplaceable. Computer disks, not the      computer. A few pounds of research notes. The folder      stuffed with tax receipts. The Rolodex. My grandfather's      pocket watch. The tape recorder . . . no. Can't take it      all. We looked around at our dear, modest little house with      its layers of memory, with its books, records, paintings,      furniture I'd made, family photos on the kitchen bulletin      board, souvenirs of friends and trips, plants, radios and      television sets and musical instruments, Julia's parents'      refrigerator, all reminders of moments in our life      together. The workaday things could be replaced. Most of      the rest couldn't. We said good-bye to them.    </p>    <p>      The neighbors, meanwhile, were turning the menace into a      social event. They'd gathered down the street a ways where      everyone could see through a gap in the trees; once packed,      we wandered down and watched as the fire fighters kept the      flames away from the foliage. In an hour or so, they put      them out.    </p>    <p>      Afterward I thought of Samuel Johnson drawling (in my mind      he sounds like an English W.C. Fields), "When a man knows      he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind      wonderfully." Everyone has emergencies, those disruptions      that emerge abruptly from the scenery and then go away. But      the 38.4 million Americans, Canadians, and Mexicans      residing on the Pacific Rim of North America (between      Alaska and the tip of Baja California) live with the      promise that something in our habitat will shake us      up-soon.    </p>    <p>      We live with impermanence. After growing up on the soft      green farmland of Chester County, Pennsylvania, and working      in New York, I moved to San Francisco in 1962. For a year      and a half I had the odd sensation that my toes couldn't      get a grip, as if a crust on the land had sealed off the      depths below. You don't dig in here, any more than you do      on the deck of a boat in rolling seas; you learn to keep      your balance not by holding tight but by holding yourself      lightly, ready to move.    </p>    <p>      As many as 4,000 earthquakes at various depths are recorded      every year in Alaska and about as many in California. The      great 1964 Alaska quake released more energy than the one      that in 1906 devastated San Francisco, killed 115 people,      and destroyed hundreds of buildings. Southern Alaska and      most of the California coast get the Uniform Building      Code's highest seismic risk rating: Zone 4, "major damage."      A damaging earthquake-5.5 and up on the Richter      scale-occurs about once a year in California and once      every 20 years or so in Oregon and Washington. The 1971 San      Fernando quake killed 58 people and injured 2,500 in      southern California. The Loma Prieta quake on October 17,      1989, during the Bay Area World Series, killed 64, injured      more than 3,000, left more than 10,000 homeless, and caused      over $10 billion in damage. Oregon and Washington have      fewer quakes, more volcanoes: Mount Saint Helens blew at      various times throughout 1980-82, killing 65 people, and      started another ash plume in January 1990. It's part of the      16-volcano Cascade Range running from Mount Lassen in      northern California to Mount Garibaldi in British Columbia,      all potentially explosive. The Redoubt volcano in Alaska      started erupting last December, causing some offshore oil      wells to be closed for fear of spills in Cook Inlet.    </p>    <p>      Much of the coastline has just two seasons: dry and wet.      Each summer, forest fires blacken thousands of acres and      brushfires attack even million-dollar houses near the      cities. In the past 15 years there have been two periods of      three years each in which winter rains were so sporadic      that water was rationed in much of northern California;      right now we're looking at a third drought. In January of      1982 a 13-inch rainstorm put the main street of our town,      San Anselmo, under five feet of water; this January much of      western Washington and Oregon flooded. Every year the      floods come to some places while others pray for rain.      Mudslides bury families in their sleep and send houses      tobogganing downhill.    </p>    <p>      You don't have to try death by hanging to appreciate the      effect, any more than you'd want your house to bum down, or      fall over in an earthquake, or be buried by volcanic ash,      or be filthied by a flood. But the prospect does tend to      keep you alert. On the dangerous edge of an otherwise      pretty safe continent, where one or all of those events      (save perhaps the hanging) can occur at any moment, you      learn not to take life for granted. This part of the planet      reminds us that we don't own it; we're just visiting.    </p>    <p>      The impermanence of our footing enlivens us, whether or not      we think about it. For better for worse, it shapes much      that we do. The knowledge that our present comforts will      last just until the land we're standing on shakes them      loose may, at first, liberate forces that can      destroy-critics love to find evidence of transience,      blandness, and violence in West Coast culture. In the long      run, however, it may do far more to stir creativity.    </p>    <p>      The point has been made many times that the environmental      movement in the United States was born in California. John      Muir founded the Sierra Club in 1892, two years after      persuading the Department of the Interior to establish      Yosemite and Sequoia national parks, the second and third      in the nation (Yellowstone was first, in 1872). Not for      nothing did <em>New Yorker</em> writer John McPhee call      David Brower, Muir's mid-20th-century successor as chief      spokesman for wilderness preservation, the Arch-druid.      Industries here reflect civilization's turn away from the      heavy, as in granite cathedrals and pig iron, to more      mobile artifacts of the intellect-among them      semiconductors, aircraft, satellites, movies, high-energy      physics, medicine, and agricultural experiment. Maybe      they'd have flourished at a site lacking earthquake, fire,      volcanic eruption, drought, and flood. The fact is, they      didn't. Sure, they use materials you can weigh and price,      but for what? To convey that most portable and      irreplaceable commodity: information. In the people who      invent and reinvent such enterprises and spin them out      across the planet, some of the restless energy of the earth      itself seems to emerge."    </p>
