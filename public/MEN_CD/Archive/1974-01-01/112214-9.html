        <p class="caption">This side view of the solar collector now in operation on a New Mexico commune shows some of the construction details of the unit's underpinnings. As you can see, there's nothing at all complicated about the piece of hardware, which illustrates one of the most exciting aspects of today's move to harness the sun: Everyone can get in on the act. Complicated labs and expensive equipment are all very nice, but for point-of-use, practical applications of solar energy, it's still hard to beat a freak with some old window panes, salvaged sheets of roofing, some 2 X 4's scrounged pipe and a can of black paint.</p>
