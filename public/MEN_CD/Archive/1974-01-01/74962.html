                    <p>      <strong>ARCHIMEDES' BURNING GLASS</strong> really could      have existed and might have been nothing but highly      polished shields, says Greek Engineer Ioannis Sakkas.      According to an old but persistent legend (scoffed at by      most historians), Archimedes broke up a Roman siege of      Syracuse about 214 B.C. by using a "burning glass" on shore      to set fire to the attacking ships while they were still at      sea. "Not so," says the scoffers, "the Ancient Greeks      didn't have the technology to make the giant lens that this      legend implies." Sakkas, however, figured that the "burning      glass" reported in the story might well be nothing but      brightly polished copper shields (something the early      Greeks would have had). And he's proven his point...by      lining 70 men up on a pier, having them turn such shields      so that they all reflected the sun's light onto a small      boat anchored 160 feet away...and then watching that vessel      burst into flame within two minutes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PHYSICIST-INVENTOR-BUSINESSMAN NICOLAUS      LAING</strong><br />      president of Germany's Laing Institute, feels that some of      his ideas can reduce fossil fuel consumption by 90% within      16 years. Dr. Laing foresaw the energy crunch nine years      ago and began an all-out development program to solve it.      Among his many breakthroughs: "super black" materials that      absorb solar radiation and retain 20 times more heat than a      perfect black body, "super white" sheets that stay cooler      than a perfect reflector, heat-rectifying roofs, vastly      improved insulating materials and heat storage units...and      an automobile that runs on latent energy. Don't laugh. A      prototype car has already been operated, the roofs were      tested in the Sahara Desert in 1970 and Laing has a long      record of delivering what he promises...already a billion      dollars worth of other Laing-designed products are sold      annually.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAHAME CAINE</strong> (see MOTHER NO. 20) is not      the only Englishman who plans to live in an "eco-house". An      engineer, a chemist, a zoologist and an architect have now      teamed up and expect to start building a completely      self-contained life support structure during the summer of      1974. About 50% of the eight-sided home's warmth will come      from the sun during the winter and the rest from heat pumps      that extract warmth stored in the soil. Water will be      collected on the roof and a windmill (also on the      building's roof) is expected to produce two kilowatts of      power. Humans will be housed on the structure's first floor      and animals underneath. All waste will be circulated      through a digester and transformed into methane for cooking      and composted fertilizer for a garden. Spent fluids from      the purification of this sewage will be filtered through      diatomite and reused for drinking and cooking purposes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>INDEPENDENT POWER DEVELOPERS</strong> , an      alternative energy firm founded in Montana one year ago, is      now ready to help "anyone with any aspect of becoming      self-sufficient, especially in the northwest area of the      U.S. and Canada". William H. Delp II, owner and manager of      IPD, says the company is a franchised dealer for Quirk's      Victory Light windplants and the James Leffel      hydro-turbines. IPD also has the tools, information and      ability to custom-build water wheels and turbines that      Leffel no longer manufactures. it looks like these guys      mean business and you can contact Delp by writing to      Independent Power Developers, P.O. Box 618, Noxon, Montana      59835.    </p>
