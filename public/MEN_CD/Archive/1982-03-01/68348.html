                <p>      <strong><em>Do your thick spring sewings yield sparse rows?      Try . . .</em></strong>    </p>            <h3>      Ben Simpson    </h3>		<p>		Last spring I decided to do something about the poor    germination rate caused by our family garden's heavy clay    soil. Double-seeding-the method we'd tried the previous    year-had resulted in nothing better than small, tangled    clumps of green alternating with long bare spots. I'd tried    preplanting in flats, too . . . but had lost almost as many    seedlings to transplant shock as I had to germination    failure. And the tiny sprouts that did survive grew very    slowly.		</p>		<p>    Of course, I'd heard about peat "starter pots" and decided to    give them a try. My first thought was to simply go out and    buy the things, but when it turned out that I'd need $24    worth to handle just one season's planting, I changed my mind    in a hurry. Instead, I bought a single compressed peat pellet    (for 8 cents) and took it home for careful examination.    </p>		<h3>      TRIAL, ERROR, AND VICTORY    </h3>    <p>      After studying the commercially prepared seed-starter, I      decided to try making my own. I had a good supply of loose      peat moss, and simply mixed a bit of it in water until I'd      produced a mash with the consistency of thick porridge.      Then I shaped the material into pellets, making fat ones,      thin ones, round ones, and square ones. After letting the      little prototypes dry in the sun, I attempted to      reconstitute them with water. However, the result was peat      soup . . . obviously it was back to-the-shed time, to try      again.<br />      <br />      Before I could make another mistake, however, I remembered      having once read an article that described a proven method      of making compressed pellets, so I looked up the subject in      MOTHER's trusty index and found that the four-page piece by      John Funk had run in issue 9. John's method seemed to      produce professional-looking peat pots, all right, but it      involved using an automobile jack and cheesecloth . . . and      I didn't want to go to the trouble of bagging and      jack-pressing the moss (but I did like his idea for using      recycled cans as compression cylinders or molds).<br />      <br />      I had determined that our pots would need to be big enough      to allow for at least two weeks' root growth, in order for      the cold-framed plants to get off to a good start. And      since there didn't seem to be any appropriately sized cans      handy, I went to my shop . . . selected a block of oak . .      . and turned a cylinder (with a 1-1/2" bore) on the lathe      and a solid piston to match. Next, I stuffed the cylinder      full of wet peat with my fingers, packed each load as tight      as possible by hand, then pushed on the piston to eject the      pellet. I soon found I could thrust a pencil into the      center of the exposed peat while it was still in the press,      thus making a hole for the seed.    </p>        <p>      Later, in the trial by immersion, the tiny receptacles held      together well, so I went to work in earnest, and was soon      able to produce about four pellets per minute. In less than      two hours I'd made enough of the little peat pots to plant      all our seeds. I didn't even bother to dry them out, but      immediately planted one seed per pot. Then I put the      pellets in a flat pan, covered each seed hole with loose      dry peat, moistened its surface, and placed the pan in my      cold frame.    </p>    <p>      Well, within three weeks, I was astonished to see that      every seed had not only germinated, but also put out a      strong root system. Better yet, not a single one      wilted-even briefly-after being picked up and      moved (pellet and all) to the vegetable patch, and none of      the relocated seedlings succumbed to transplant shock.    </p>    <h3>      MAKING IT EASY    </h3>    <p>      As I said, I created my first press from a piece of oak,      using a lathe . . . but there are other-and      easier-ways to make similar devices. Before you build      one, though, you'll have to decide how big your mold should      be. My cylinder was 1" deep and 1-1/2" in diameter, but you      might find that a different size will better suit the seeds      you'll be planting. Once you've determined the dimensions,      you can simply select a container or cylinder of the      correct diameter. For example, a good press could consist      of a piece of pipe, a small metal screw-top jar lid that      fits inside, and a plunger made from a section of      broomstick.<br />      <br />      My own second peat compressor was constructed from a      plastic container-which had held frozen orange      juice-measuring 2-1/2" in diameter. I set aside its      lid and cut around the container about an inch (you can      choose any height you want the pellets to be) above the      bottom. Next, I made a hole in the closed end of the can,      large enough to accommodate a piece of 1/2" dowel about 4"      long. Then I cut around the outside edge of the lid,      trimming it until it could slide down inside the container,      and punched a hole in its center. Finally, I drilled a      small pilot hole in the end of the dowel and screwed the      lid to the rod. (If the top isn't stiff enough, put two      lids together for double thickness . . . or use a circle of      wood or rigid metal.) I was then able to slide the free end      of the dowel down through the 1/2" opening in the      container's bottom. The result: an effective, easily made      pellet producer!    </p>    <h3>      PRESSING ONWARD    </h3>    <p>      In most areas a 2-cubic-foot bale of peat moss shouldn't      cost more than $5.00 or so. Once you have it, moisten the      moss with water and let it sit overnight (it should develop      the consistency of a moist bread dough). One gallon of the      mixture will be enough to make several hundred peat pots,      so a bale should be good for thousands of plant      starters.<br />      <br />      Now, following the procedure I used, just pack your      press-firmly-with the damp moss, make a seed      hole with a stick, and push on the plunger until your disk      clears the barrel of the press. Use a spatula to slide the      pellet off the plunger, and place the little peat cakes on      a board to dry if you intend to store them. On the other      hand, should you be ready to start some seedlings, put the      still-damp pellets in your flats and plant the seeds at      once. Pretty soon they'll be sprouting leaves, standing up,      and just begging to be set out in the ground. And before      you know it, you'll be harvesting tasty vegetables . . .      from dang near every seed you planted!    </p>
