        <hr /><p><strong>THIS MESSAGE IS BROUGHT TO YOU BY. . .</strong> A California company has devised a tombstone containing a photovoltaic-cell-powered tape recorder, for those folks who'd like to deliver their own eulogies. The unit is called a "memorial audio reproduction system" . . . and its inventor believes that a sun-powered color video player may soon become available, to provide mourners with instant replays of the departed's life.</p><p><strong>TUMBLELOGS:</strong> Researchers at the University of Arizona have discovered that tumbleweed, which has been an annoyance to southwestern farmers ever since it was imported from Europe to this country in contaminated seed, can be harvested and processed into slow-burning, BTU-packed logs. One of the compressed-weed billets will burn for two to three hours in a fireplace, and will provide more energy than mesquite, oak, or compacted sawdust logs.</p><p><strong>SUN STANDARDS:</strong> The California Energy Commission is considering enacting regulations requiring that manufactured solar collectors be certified if purchasers are to qualify for energy tax credits. If passed, the rules will force commercially available glazed flat plate, unglazed, line focus, and evacuated tube collectors to meet certain performance criteria before the tax credit can be applied.</p><p><strong>"MOUNT TRASHMORE"</strong> the gigantic landfill near Staten Island, New York, has recently been tapped to run a small electric power plant. Engineers say that the 40- to 50-foot depths of decomposing garbage in the dump may produce enough methane to provide years of free fuel.</p><p><strong>THE GREAT SALT LAKE COLLECTOR:</strong> Scientists at Utah State University are studying the feasibility of using the 1,700-square-mile surface of the Great Salt Lake as a solar collector to provide electricity for most of Utah's citizens. Heat from the lake's bottom (which has been found to be near the boiling point) would be used to vaporize freon or ammonia, which, in turn, would drive a turbine generator.</p><p><strong>ICEBERG POWER:</strong> Three California researchers have patented a method by which icebergs can be melted to produce fresh water and mechanical energy. In the process, warm surface water is first evaporated by being pumped into a vacuum, and the resulting vapor operates an electricity-generating turbine. Cold water, from the iceberg, is then used to condense the vapor, and the liquid is used to melt the remainder of the floe.</p><p><strong>PERPETUAL SOLAR:</strong> Solarex, a large photovoltaics company, has broken ground for the world's first "solar breeder" in Frederick, Maryland. The sun-powered facility will produce 200 kilowatts of electricity, an amount sufficient to support a plant manufacturing photovoltaic cells. Solarex claims the building will be the first large, self-supported solar energy industrial site.</p><p><strong>HOME FURNACE COGENERATION:</strong> A Maryland engineer has developed a device that uses the waste heat from a gas or oil home furnace to make steam, which then turns a small turbine linked to an electric generator. The inventor claims that as much as $545 a year in cogenerated electricity can be produced with the unit.</p><p><strong>RADIOACTIVE MICE:</strong> Staff at the beleaguered Three Mile Island nuclear facility have found radioactive mice droppings in the basement of the reactor control room building. Exterminators have been called . . . and TMI officials have hastened to assure the public that, even though the rodent pellets emit half again as much radiation as does a chest X-ray, they pose no significant health hazard to humans or area wildlife.</p><p><strong>PRODUCE PRODUCTION:</strong> A gas- and oil-fired power plant in Queens will utilize preheated waste water from its electricity-generating processes to warm a one-acre greenhouse in which tomatoes, cucumbers, and lettuce will be grown. According to New York's Research and Development Authority, the project will cost $300,000, create 10 new jobs, and yield more than 780,000 pounds of vegetables annually.</p><p>Oceanside, California has established a <strong>"MUNICIPAL SOLAR UTILITY"</strong><strong>,</strong> whereby the city acts as middleman between solar equipment rental businesses and consumers who want to lease the hardware .... <strong>THE NATIONAL GASOHOL COMMISSION ,</strong> one of the primary advocates of farmer's fuel, closed its offices on November 17, 1981, a victim of slackening financial support and internal bickering .... Texaco is employing fiberglass and stainless steel <strong>MARINE WIND TURBINES</strong> to power navigational aids affixed to its drilling platforms in California's Santa Barbara channel (a plan for photovoltaic units was discarded when it was discovered that roosting seagulls liked to sit on the panels) .... A University of Washington geophysicist who has studied the flow of <strong>NATURALLY</strong>Â <strong>OCCURRING ELECTRIC CURRENTS</strong> beneath the earth's surface believes these charges can be used to help pinpoint mineral deposits, such as seams of coal, and sources of geothermal power .... The University of Minnesota is conducting experiments using <strong>AQUIFERS-WELL-INSULATED LAYERS OF WATERY SAND</strong> -as heat storage mediums. Preliminary tests indicate that as much as 80% of the warmth provided by pumped-in heated water can be reclaimed .... Envirokinetics Corporation of New York has devised a method of <strong>DECONTAMINATING TOXIC WASTES USING GAMMA RA DIATION</strong> from cesium 137, a waste product of nuclear power generation .... The U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Electrification Administration has approved a $4.2 million study to determine whether it is practical <strong>TO STORE COMPRESSED AIR UNDERGROUND</strong> to generate extra power when electricity demand peaks.</p>
