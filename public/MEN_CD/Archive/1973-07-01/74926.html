                        <p>      SPECIAL NOTE: <em>GROW IT!</em> is a <em>big book</em> and      even if a chunk this size were to be run in issue after      issue after issue of MOTHER, it would take over two years      to put the complete volume in your hands. If you haven't      got two years to play around with, we recommend that you      truck on down to your nearest book store and shelf out      $8.95 for your very own copy of <em>GROW IT!</em> That way,      Richard Langer will be happy, Saturday Review Press will be      happy ...and we're betting that you'll be happy too. It's a      darn good book.    </p>     <p>      EXTRA SPECIAL NOTE: All material here reprinted from      <em>GROW IT!</em><br />      Copy right © 1972 by Richard W. Langer.    </p>        <p>      <strong>At last! For the first time since the HAVE-MORE      Plan was published way back in the 1940's, a fellow named      Richard W. Langer has come up with a 365-page book that      really introduces a beginner to small-scale farming. Wanna      raise your own fruit, nuts, berries, vegetables, grain,      chickens, pigs, ducks, geese and honeybees?      <em>GROW IT!</em> tells you how to get started, we      like it, and here's another chapter from the book.</strong>    </p>    <p>        God gives the milk but not the pail.<br />      <em>-OLD ENGLISH PROVERB</em>    </p>     <p>      Milk and cheese are staples in our diet, and the apprentice      farmer's first thoughts on dairy matters are apt to be of a      cow. But while there's nothing wrong with having a cow on      your spread, sometimes she's more trouble than she's worth.    </p>    <p>      A cow will produce twenty quarts of milk or so a day, which      is a lot for one family to consume, yet not enough to make      a real business proposition out of daily milk sales. In a      communal situation, of course, consumption would be no      problem. But milking might. A cow will adjust to being      milked twice a day at just about any hour as long as the      schedule is regular; however, milk production is best if      she deals consistently with the same person. Unless you      have a real bovine buff in your midst, this might present a      problem in labor allocation.    </p>    <p>      It may well be simpler to build up your flock of hens to      the point where you can swap eggs for milk on a regular      basis with a neighboring dairy farmer. Still, by the time      you've been in the country a year or so, you may want a      milk-and-cheese source right on your property . . . maybe      meat and leather too. Well then, a goat is your answer.    </p>    <p>      There are many advantages to goats, not the least of which,      is that goat's milk, sweet and tasty, is more readily      digestible than cow's milk, and hence more nourishing. You      are what you digest, not what you eat. Also, goats don't      get tuberculosis, so you don't have to worry about      pasteurization, which not only takes time and equipment,      but, as with any other food-heating process, can cause      vitamin loss as well.    </p>    <p>      Goats are basically good-natured (remember, however, that      the word "capricious" comes from the Latin caprus, meaning      "goat"). They are easy to care for, clean, and excellent      fertilizer producers. Goat manure ranks far above cow      manure for nitrogen content and is surpassed in this      important fertilizer component only by rabbit and chicken      manure, placing it high on the list of desirable droppings.      So why not a goat or two?    </p>    <h3>BREEDS</h3>    <p>      Goats, by their nature, will fare well in any part of the      United States. This goes for any of the different breeds,      and so selection is made on the basis of other factors. One      fairly important for the apprentice farmer is the      preferences of other goat raisers in the area, if there are      any. If people in your vicinity are raising Alpines, don't      raise Nubians. Not that the other goat breeders would      refuse to help you, but they are a bit clannish, Besides,      you're better off getting your goats from someone you can      talk to later about any problems you have. A good goat's a      good goat, and a bad one's a "bad 'un", no matter what her      breed.    </p>    <p>      Whichever breed you do settle on, stay with it. Don't try      raising two or three different kinds at once. Familiarity      breeds knowledge, and as a beginner you don't want to      spread yourself too thin.    </p>    <p>      In goat trader's lingo, a "pure breed" is just what its      name implies: both parents are known and of the same      registered breed. A "grade", on the other hand, has a      registered purebred sire, with the other parent of unknown      or mixed pedigree. The latter is cheaper, of course, and      will serve your milk pail and cheese hoop quite adequately.      On the other hand, if you plan to stay on the farm you      might consider buying purebred registered goats and      breeding your own herd. Part of the joy of country living      is helping to bring out the best in Mother Nature.    </p>    <p>      <em>Nubians.</em> These Roman-nosed beauties are of      English-African-Oriental descent. They have a short, sleek      coat ranging through a broad variety of colors and color      combinations. Their ears are long and drooping.    </p>    <p>      <em>Saanens.</em> Among the most prolific producers of      milk, the white/cream-colored Saanens originated in the      Swiss valley of the same name. They are large, relatively      short-legged, straight or concave-faced, with small, erect      cars. Some purebred Saanen does have produced over five      thousand pounds of milk a year.    </p>    <p>      <em>Toggenburgs. These</em> are the most popular goats      today ... at least to judge by nose count. They fit the      common image of a goat, brown, with lighter markings down      the face, and inside the legs joining a light-colored      underbelly. They have erect ears, a gently concave face,      and an extended tail. Native to the Toggenburg Valley of      Switzerland, they were the first goats imported to the      United States in quantity, which accounts for their      numerical strength.    </p>    <p>      <em>French</em> <em>Alpines.</em> Color varies from pure      white to spattered black. The body configuration is similar      to that of the Toggenburg and the Saanen, although the eyes      are more prominent.<br />    </p>    <p>      Whatever the breed, a goat will have its basic good points      and flaws. If you buy locally, try to get one that's      between two and four months old, freshly weaned. Inspect      the animal before purchasing, checking that the goat has a      straight back line. A back humped between the fore and hind      legs is known as a roach back, one with a depression as      sway back. Avoid both. The rump should be long and not      slanted down toward the tail too steeply. The chest should      be wide and the heart girth, the circumference around the      front ribs, should be large. Basically, you want a goat      that is rugged looking, with straight legs, standing      squarely on its hoofs. Avoid goats with horns and you'll      avoid a lot of hazardous ramming around the barnyard. If      possible, have a took at several different goats so you can      get a natural feel for a good, round, symmetrical udder      (although rarely are both halves exactly alike) with      well-located teats pointed slightly forward,<br />    </p>    <p>      I'd rather drive two hundred miles to look over and pick up      my goat than have it shipped. But if you have to order by      mail, ask the breeder for bank references and the names of      previous buyers. Insist on a written contract and a      veterinarian's certificate stating the animal is free from      disease and parasites.    </p>    <p>      Once you've located a reliable breeder-ferret him out      through the Dairy Goat Journal or your area farm paper if      local advice doesn't unearth one-you might as well      follow his recommendations in purchasing stock. But      remember, a breeder rarely sells his best stock. He's spent      years building up a breeding herd and isn't about to skim      off the cream of his labors for you. This doesn't mean he's      going to sell you secondrate stock either, of course. Just      don't be disappointed if your doe's milk-production record      is not quite up to that of her mother. And a goat giving      four quarts a day for a professional might produce only two      quarts for the amateur ... but you don't stay an amateur      forever. Another consideration is that goats get terribly      homesick and will often produce less their first year in      new quarters, particularly if alone. Keeping two goats, if      you can, lessens the problem greatly.    </p>    <h3>      HOUSING</h3>     <p>      Keeping goats is one of the simplest livestock operations.      The basic need is for a dry, well-ventilated but draft-free      shelter that is easy to keep clean. You can remodel a      garage or outbuilding for your goat stable, or you can      construct one from scratch. The space requirement for      stanchioned goats is about three by five feet per animal      plus two feet for a feed alley (that's for you to walk      along while tending the animals). If the goats are to be      housed in a barn without stanchions, as is recommended,      plan on ten to twelve square feet per head.    </p>    <p>      For cleanliness, a gently sloped concrete floor with good      drainage must be provided. In severely cold climates a      raised wooden platform, one which can be moved for      cleaning, should cover part of the cement so the goats will      have a warm spot to sleep. Even the thickest bedding might      not insulate the cold concrete enough in really wintry      weather, and, besides, the thicker the bedding, the more      difficult the cleaning.    </p>    <p>      If possible, the goat barn should be located near a source      of water pressure sufficient for it to be hosed down once a      day. But be sure to let it dry thoroughly after hosing      before you allow the goats back in. The barn should also be      disinfected occasionally with a good scrubbing, using      ammonia or pine tar and water. Nicotine sulphate is highly      poisonous, to man as well as to insects and bacteria, and      is not recommended as a disinfectant, nor is creosote      spray, which is also readily absorbed by the milk.    </p>    <p>      Painting the inside of the barn as well as the outside is a      good measure for disease prevention and highly recommended.      Avoid leadbased paints, since goats may nibble on flaking      surfaces and die from lead poisoning. Old-fashioned      whitewash, homemade without DDT, is still best.    </p>    <h3>WHITEWASH</h3>     <p>      1 oz. casein glue<br />      10 oz. hydrated lime    </p>    <p>      Make a separate, smooth paste of each, using water. Stir      them together with enough water to make a slurry. Mix well.      Add:    </p>    <p>      1 teaspoon salt    </p>    <p>      Thin with more water. The final wash should be thin enough      so that when brushed onto a newspaper you can still read      the small type. Use two coats or more.    </p>    <p>      Ventilation is essential in a goat barn, as in all other      livestock housing. One of the big variables here is ceiling      height. As one moves from the southern United States to the      North, ceiling height should decrease proportionately in      order to keep in the heat, and hence total floor space      might have to be increased. Plan on having one hundred      cubic feet of air space per goat and at least one square      foot of openable window for each two hundred and fifty      cubic feet of barn space. Even more window space is better,      since sunlight is a natural <em>preceding</em>      disinfectant. However, if you're located where the winters      tend to be severe, make certain the extra windows can be      covered by a double pane or shutter in the wintertime so      the inside temperature can be regulated to around 55°F.      Too cold, and the goats will concentrate on keeping warm      instead of making milk. Don't make the opposite mistake of      trying to keep the indoors temperature in the pleasant 70s;      the goats, overprotected, will chill when they go outside.    </p>    <p>      Year round, all windows left open should be screened to      minimize flies. The barn doors, including the one you use,      should be solid, not screened. If you use a screen door,      the flies will hang around just waiting for you to open it,      and they'll beat you inside every time.    </p>    <p>      In the summertime the barn is an important source of shade.      Goats are not bothered by heat as long as they can avoid      too much direct, prolonged sunlight, a matter about which      they know best, and are assured an ample supply of clean,      fresh drinking water.    </p>    <h3>EQUIPMENT</h3>  <p>      The goat, as opposed to, say, a chicken or a horse, is a      wasteful feeder. Food spilled on the floor will not be      eaten. Therefore, well-designed mangers and grain feeders      are important to an economical goat operation.    </p>    <p>      Water can be provided in a bucket or trough, anchored so      the goats will not knock it over. The disadvantage of this      form of watering is that goats are quite fussy as to what      they will drink. And drink they must, in quantity, to      produce milk. Even so, they won't touch contaminated water.    </p>    <p>      For this reason I prefer a running water system wherever      possible. An old sink, or a specially constructed raised      trough with a bottom drain and a lead-off pipe, can be used      where the water supply permits continuous filling. It      doesn't have to be a great rush of fresh water every      minute; a steady trickle, pulling contamination down the      drain, will keep your goats happy. If your water source is      very cold, you'll have to build a holding tank inside the      barn to let it warm up before it reaches the trough.    </p>    <p>      To go with the water you will want a salt lick. It coaxes      the goats to drink more, at the same time supplying a      necessary part of their diet.    </p>    <p>      Toys are essential in bringing up goats. A milking doe      should not be allowed to jump about too much, since the      energy so expended will cut into milk production. However,      dry and growing stock need plenty of exercise. If your      barnyard isn't naturally rocky, make some mountains ... a      sturdy crate or two, of different sizes, for them to jump      on, an exercise ramp and-don't laugh-a seesaw.      Bucks like to play with an empty barrel or a swinging tire.    </p>    <p>      The primary objective of having a dairy goat is, of course,      milk. The equipment needed here can range from basic to      fancy, but in all cases will include a screened-off room or      separate milk house-a separate house is      preferable-to aid in keeping out flies. (If you get      the idea that flies are one of your biggest dairy problems,      particularly in the summertime, you're right. Keep them      under control with a clean barn, and remember to always      close the door behind you.) In your milking shed you'll      need a milk pail, a strainer, storage containers (bottles      and milk cans), and cooling facilities, either electric or      ice buckets. In small bottles to insure quick cooling,      fresh milk for family consumption can be placed directly in      the refrigerator next to the cooling unit. In any case, it      must be cooled to 45°F <em>.</em> as quickly as      possible. Milk held at room temperature will deteriorate      rapidly. One last item: A milking stand is helpful mostly      to you, since it raises the udder to a level where you can      milk comfortably while sitting on a stool. Any low platform      for the goat to stand on will suffice, but it should have a      stanchion at one end to keep the goat steady and in place.    </p>    <h3>FEEDING</h3>      <p>      For the novice farmer in particular, the best nutritional      results are probably produced by using a balanced      commercial goat feed, carefully following the      manufacturer's instructions. If you want to blend your own      mix, ask your county agent for advice. He'll be listed in      the phone book under "County Extension Service". Should you      happen to be in an area relatively devoid of goat farms, he      might say he's not familiar enough with the animal to help      you. Don't let that be a deterrent. Goats will do well on      the same mix he recommends for milch cows.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GRAIN MIX FOR GOATS</strong>    </p>    <p>      40 tbs. ground corn<br />      35 tbs. ground oats<br />      10 tbs. linseed oil meal<br />      12 tbs. wheat bran<br />      1 1/2 tbs. salt<br />      1 1/2 tbs. trace minerals (prepackaged)    </p>    <p>      Goats are as choosy in their feeding habits as in their      drinking. Not only do they not eat tin cans, they don't      even like food that has been nosed over in their feeding      troughs all day. Less food, more often, is the standard      rule-of-thumb. A minimum of two feedings ten hours apart is      recommended; three evenly spaced feedings of less quantity      are even better. A lactating goat, eating all the grass and      hay she wants, will have a well-balanced diet with the      addition of a total of four to eight pounds of grain a day.      Here are some general guidelines to goat feeding:    </p>    <p>      1. Always feed your herd normal rations before sending them      out to pasture. This is particularly important in spring      when they are switching over to fresh greens. Allowing them      to fill up on all those green goodies after the long      wintering can cause severe bloating.    </p>        <p>      2. It is usually economically handy to switch from mix to      mix depending on the season, but don't do it overnight.      Change the diet gradually over the period of a week.    </p>    <p>      3. Consider grain an addition to the normal feed ration,      not its main component. A goat's stomach is designed to      handle bulk from grazing, so good-quality, well-cured      alfalfa, clover, or soybean hay should be the basic staple      of the animal's diet.    </p>    <p>      4. If hay is scarce and you must increase grain feeding,      make sure the mix has a generous helping of wheat bran or      dried vegetable pulp to add bulk. If her diet isn't bulky      enough, your goat will have digestive problems, and in turn      less milk to give. Lack of appetite and lighter-than-usual,      crumbly manure are the first indications of insufficient      bulk in the feed.    </p>        <p>      5. Whenever possible, let the goats graze naturally in the      pasture. The animal prefers a legume pasture to a grassy      one, however. Prepare for this by sowing alfalfa, clover,      and the like. Also, goats are browsers; that is, they      prefer eating somewhere between the ground level of cattle      and the treetop level of giraffes. There should be plenty      of bushes and shrubs in their pasture. Sonic people try to      take advantage of the browsing pattern by pasturing goats      on wild, uncultivated land that is to be cleared, so they      will eat it clean; this practice will not provide the goats      with an adequate diet, however, unless well supplemented.    </p>    <p>      6. Milking does must, as all other livestock, have      continuous access to salt. Provide a salt or mineral lick.      It is particularly important that the salt for freshened      does be iodized to prevent goiters in the young kids.    </p>    <p>      7. Calcium and phosphorus are essential to the feed mix.      These are best supplied in a block, or from a mineral      feeder.    </p>    <p>      8. Keep feed clean at all times. This includes keeping      other stock, such as chickens and even cats and dogs, out      of the hay.    </p>    <p>      9. Remember there are three types of feeding: the grain      mix, which is a supplement to balance the diet and not to      be overused, manger feeding of hay, and fresh forage. The      last two should constitute the largest part of your goat's      diet,    </p>    <h3>BREEDING</h3>      <p>      It takes two to get milk. Even the best-bred doe will not      produce unless she is mated and kids. You may choose to buy      a doe that is already freshened, that is, she has given      birth and is lactating. Or you may want to start with a      young doe and raise her to the milking stage. A young doe      can be bred to freshen at fifteen months. The best breeding      period is fall through early winter.    </p>    <p>      Starting with a young doe is recommended for the beginner.      The initial lack of milk will be more than compensated for      by the opportunity the young doe provides for the new      farmer to gradually learn about goats and how they grow.      Besides, the farm will boast at least one new      goat-and usually two or three-once the young      doe is bred. On the negative side of the ledger, it means      stepping right into five months of prenatal care, delivery,      and a month of aftercare rather early in your dairy career.      But there's an amazing pleasure and excitement to be found      in watching the kid grow day by day, And you'll have to      learn about kidsitting sooner or later anyway. Even a      once-freshened doe won't give milk indefinitely, so      you'll want more than one, and you might as well have the      joy of raising your own.    </p>    <p>      Whichever way you choose to start your goat herd, you're      going to need the stud services of a buck eventually. At      first glance, a buck of your own would seem the most direct      approach to the problem. But think twice about the idea. It      is really not economical for a small-scale operation. As      opposed to a doe, a buck is smelly even in the best of      conditions. Hence he must be kept separate from your does      to avoid odor contamination of the milk. His services are      needed only once a year per doe, but he eats all year      round. And he's a lot more temperamental and active than a      doe.    </p>    <p>      A better alternative is to hire a buck from a nearby farm      as a stud (another good reason for raising the same breed      your neighbors do). Stud service can also be handled by      mail, the animals being shipped back and forth by express.      A third alternative is to form a cooperative association of      new goat raisers, sharing the costs and responsibilities of      keeping the buck.    </p>    <h3>KIDDING</h3>    <p>      Keep a record of when your doe was bred. The gestation      period for goats is 145 to 155 days, or roughly five      months. About the 140th day, your doe will begin to become      restless. She'll seem nervous and a little irritable. She      will probably paw her bedding and bleat quietly and often.      Have a draft-free, heavily bedded private stall ready for      the kidding. As the actual birth draws nearer, she will lie      down and get up repeatedly. At last she'll stay down and      begin labor.    </p>    <p>      For the first time, have someone familiar with the process      around. You'd probably have no trouble on your own ...      after all, goats were giving birth long before man      domesticated them and your doe's instincts will carry her      through. But if you've never been around kidding before,      you probably wouldn't instinctively recognize the signs of      any complication or how to respond. And the object of the      game is to raise a kid or two successfully and to learn in      the process.    </p>    <h3>KIDS AND WEANING</h3>   <p>      The usual practice in kidding is to take the kid from the      doe as soon as the proud dam has cleaned it off. Be sure      not to let the kid nurse or you may have great difficulty      coaxing it to pan-feed later. Wipe the kid dry with clean      cloths and place it in a well-bedded box, preferably in a      sunny spot in the barn. The sun will help dry and warm the      kid and act as a mild natural disinfectant. Sunshine is      just plain healthy.    </p>    <p>      A newborn kid is sensitive to abrupt temperature changes.      Since kids in nature are born outdoors, their resistance to      cold is greater than You would expect, and kidding can be      done outdoors, but if the newborn kid is then taken into      the barn, it must be allowed to adjust gradually to the      temperature change. The same holds true when taking the kid      from the barn outdoors.    </p>    <p>      Some breeders prefer to let the kid nurse from the dam, or      mother doe, the first couple of times. <em>Don't do      it.</em> Milk the dam and then feed the colostrum-rich      first milk to the kid. The colostrum, thick and yellow, is      full of vitamins needed by the new kid.    </p>    <p>      A new kid will want to be fed soon, usually within the      first six hours. You'll know when from the look on his face      and the way he moves. At such time, milk the dam. The kid,      may be either pan-fed or bottle-fed. Bottle-feeding      requires a little bit more work,; particularly, more things      to sterilize. On the other hand, it ensure$ that the kid      will not drink too fast and is a lot more fun. Dont let the      milk cool down before feeding. Should there be a delay, you      will have to reheat it to about 10°'F., or slightly      above body temperature. Feeding cold milk produces scours,      or acute diarrhea.    </p>    <p>      New born kids should be fed about one-third of a pint five      time 1rst two days, a half a pint four times daily, the      next twelve days. Feed more if the kid is constantly      hungry, less if diarrhea develops. Vary the amount fed      rather than the number of feedings. At the end of the      two-week period, feeding can be reduced to three times      daily, while at the same time the quantity is increased.      Remember, however, overfeeding is more harmful than      underfeeding. Also, to ensure good growth and to flush out      the kid's system, let it drink as much warm water as it      wants five minutes after each feeding. The addition of half      a teaspoon of cod liver oil a day to the diet will help the      kid along.    </p>    <p>      You probably won't want to use all of the dam's milk to      feed the kid or kids. Either powdered skim milk or Dairyaid      (a specially prepared formula) is a perfectly acceptable      substitute after the first week. Mix according to      directions and ease the kids onto their new diet slowly.      Second-week, feeding should be one-quarter skim milk,      three-quarters dam's; third week, half skim, half dam's,      and so on. However, be sure the initial feedings use only      the milk the dam gives, since the colostrum of the first      milk, is essential to the kid's well-being.    </p>    <p>      A kid is usually weaned by the time it is six weeks old.      Lead up to this starting the fifteenth day by adding a      couple of tablespoons of finely ground cooked oatmeal with      a pinch of salt to each feeding, (By this stage of course,      you will have to enlarge the hole in the nipple for the      oatmeal if you're bottle-feeding.) Increase the oatmeal      each day until by the fifth week you are feeding half gruel      and half milk.<br />      <br />      Sometime in the second week the kid will probably start      niubblirig at a little choice hay. Start supplementing its      diet then with some kid-starting ration. Leave a small      quantity around at all times. Commercial kid rations, the      result of professional testing, are highly recommended for      the apprentice farmer. You'll have so much to learn and get      a feel for with your first kids that you might as well take      advantage of this "instant farmhand". Follow the      instructions and you'll end up with a healtheir goat than      Mother Nature's sometimes erratic rations in the wild could      produce.    </p>    <p>      Remember, cleanliness is always important, but when it      comes to young farm animals, cleanliness is imperative. A      kid's accommodations must be kept always dry, sheltered      from drafts, yet well ventilated.    </p>    <p>      Exercise and sunshine are essential. Let the kid out to      play when he's, frisky.    </p>    <h3>THE DAM</h3>    <p>      For a few days after kidding the fresh doe should be fed      lightly. Too much food will raise her milk output too      rapidly and may cause mastitis or other udder troubles that      could permanently impair her milk production. Check to see      that the udder does not become overfilled and hot. If it      does, milk the doe three or four times a day, or as often      as needed to relieve this condition. Within three or four      days the first rush of milk should slow down and the signs      of colostrum should have vanished. Even so, the doe will      not reach peak production for about a month.</p>            <h3>MILKING</h3>         <p>      You can lead a goat to the pail, but she isn't going to      milk herself. Nor are you by merely pulling the teats      randomly. Milking isn't all that difficult, and once you've      gotton the technique down pat, it will be automatic. The      best way to learn is to watch a local farmer. If for some      reason there's no one around to teach you, a good way to      practice before tackling the goat herself is with the      Richard W. Langer non-patented artificial udder. Take two      long balloons. Pinprick holes in their tips. Attach each      one to a bottle half-filled with water. Tape the, bottles      together invert, and go at it. It's not the real thing, but      if you can milk balloons well, you'll upset the goat less      when it's her turn.    </p>    <p>      The goat should be led up onto a milking platform with a      stanchion. Milk readily absorbs odors, so pick a milking      spot well removed from all possible sources of olfactory      contamina. tion. The stall, or preferably a separate shed,      should be whitewashed, screened against flies, and free      from dampness; in general, it should approach the sanitary      conditions of a hospital.    </p>    <p>      Once the goat has mounted the stand, something she will do      happily with a full udder once she's used to being milked      there, place her head in the stanchion.    </p>    <p>      Cleanliness is paramount. The doe's hindquarters and udder      should be kept trimmed (more on that later) to avoid hair      contamination of milk. Before milking, sponge down the      udder with a clean cloth and warm water, then dry.    </p>    <p>      Place a stainless steel bucket, presterilized with boiling      water, beneath the udder and take a seat at the goat's side      ... it doesn't matter which, but always use the same side.      Goats like the comfort of consistency. For the same reason,      it's best that the same person always do the milking.      (Although in some areas goats are milked from the rear,      this is a practice to be avoided, since it causes      sanitation problems and has no real advantages.)    </p>    <p>      You're ready to go. Take the furthest teat in the V of your      thumb and forefinger, near the udder. Close the two fingers      in a scissorlike motion to prevent the milk from being      forced upwards. With a slight downward pull but a firm      grasp, squeeze in the second, third, and little finger in      sequence. Release. Now the other teat with the other band.      Release and start again. You'll have to develop a touch for      it, because all anyone else can tell you is just not to      squeeze too hard, yet not too gently either. The single      most important factor is to make your motions smooth.    </p>    <p>      Milk both teats, alternating each stroke, until they are      empty. The udder should always be completely drained. When      the milk ceases to flow, give the udder a light massage by      the teats and "strip" the udder by passing the hand down      each teat as before, but without releasing any of the      fingers, thus draining the last drop.    </p>    <h3>MILK PROCESSING</h3>     <p>      Anything to do with milk processing must be absolutely      clean. All utensils must be sterilized ... with live steam      where possible, boiling water where not. You can get a      small steam generator, which is really nothing more than an      oversized tea-kettle, quite inexpensively,    </p>    <p>      Use seamless stainless steel containers wherever possible      for the actual milk processing. Glass bottles are ideal for      storage. Rinse them well, follow with a soap-and-warm-water      wash and yet another hot-water rinse, then scald with live      steam if possible. Boiling water is a barely acceptable      substitute. <em>Do not wipe</em> dry, Allow to air dry      before using.    </p>    <p>      The milk should be strained as soon as you've finished      milking. Disposable sterile cloth strainers are very good      for this, cutting down the amount of cleaning necessary.      Don't expose the milk to direct sunlight for a prolonged      period, since this may cause excessive oxidation and bad      flavor.    </p>        <p>      Rapid cooling of the milk is essential. After straining,      bring its temperature down to 45°F., or slightly less,      by placing the containers in buckets of iced water if you      haven't invested in an electric milk cooler. Use a      thermometer to make sure the desired temperature is reached      and held for thirty minutes. Small batches such as you      would get from one or two does can be placed directly into      the refrigerator. However, if you do this, make sure you      place the milk in prechilled bottles no larger than quart      size as close to the freezer unit as possible to insure      rapid cooling.    </p>    <h3>MILK PROBLEMS</h3>   <p>      If you've spent all your life drinking milk out of paper      cartons you may be surprised to learn that a lot of things      can spoil milk between the udder and the cup. Some things      even before it leaves the udder. A goat can be thought of      as a natural milk machine. As such, the end product is no      better than the raw materials used, that is to say, the      food eaten.    </p>    <p>      Food flavorings-good and bad, from clover to      onions-that affect milk are usually caused by      volatile plant oils just as are many more familiar food      flavorings ... from vanilla to cloves. These oils are      absorbed into the bloodstream and, because the vital udder      draws heavily on the circulating blood supply, their      flavors are easily absorbed by the milk. So unless you      really like onion-flavored milk, don't let your does graze      in pastures overgrown with wild onions. Turnips, cabbage,      and potato greens can also impart a bad taste to milk.      Garlic is absolutely fatal to the flavor. Grains, on the      other hand, tend to sweeten the milk, and thus are      desirable as feed from this as well as from a nutritional      standpoint.    </p>    <p>      There are other plants you should keep from your goats. Not      because they will directly produce off-flavored milk, but      because they may make her ill, or even cause death. The      best way to learn what dangerous plants might affect your      livestock in any particular region is to talk with the      locals. As a start, goats should not be allowed to graze on      azaleas, laurel, milkweed and wild cherry.    </p>    <p>      Your doe's health will also affect the quality and flavor      of her milk. A goat that isn't feeling up to par will still      produce milk-after all, if nature had not so prepared      it, a wild goat herd might have become extinct after a      severe epidemic of winter colds-but that doesn't mean      milk from sick goats is desirable. A herd or a single goat      should always be kept in the best physical shape possible.    </p>    <p>      Blood in the milk might not give it a bad flavor;      nevertheless it's an obvious sign of trouble. It indicates      possible injury to the udder, such as bruising, an      imbalanced diet, or mastitis. Although you will be able to      handle these problems by yourself once you know how to      diagnose them, it is best to get either your veterinarian      or a local dairyman (milch cow men tend to scorn      goat-keepers, so get an acquaintanceship going before      trouble arrives) to diagnose the problem for you and      discuss the solution.    </p>    <p>      You may be talking to the veterinarian more than you      expected to the first year, but information like this      really can be transmitted only in the old oral-visual      tradition. When contacting a veterinarian, make sure that      he specializes in farm animals, and is not a suburbanite      poddle-and-pussy doctor. The pet vet will probably be just      as competent, but your bills in all likelihood will be      three times as large. In contrast, I know of one local farm      veterinarian who takes care of a goat herd in exchange for      a wheel of cheese now and then.    </p>    <p>      If you learn to recognize symptoms of a goat's lack of the      best health, you're already doing well. The rest will come      with time, and talk, and just watching.    </p>    <p>      After fresh milk has stood a few hours, you may notice a      redness to it that you didn't observe while milking.      Chances are it's a bacterial by-product rather than blood.      Poor sterilization is the usual cause, although sometimes      failure to cool the milk rapidly enough will also induce      the same undesirable tinge. The remedy is greater      cleanliness.    </p>    <p>      Any utensils that have come in contact with infected milk      must be extra carefully washed and sterilized. It's also a      good idea to wash the doe's udder thoroughly.    </p>    <p>      Ropy milk, or "long milk" as it's called in Sweden, is an      ancient favorite of some north European farmers. However,      even there its popularity is fading rapidly, and in the      United States it has never been appreciated at all.      Politely speaking, the milk becomes slimy and stringy,      although where I grew up we called it snotty. This change      in its physical characteristics is also caused by bacteria,      harmless enough ones, either in the udder or after milking.      Here again, the problem usually can be solved by increased      sanitation.    </p>    <h3>THE DRY DOE</h3>    <p>      A young doe may be freshened for the first time at about      fifteen months if she has been well raised and is in good      health. However, she's not going to produce milk for the      rest of her life from one freshening. Trying to stretch out      her milk-productive period too long without freshening      again will impair her health and generally cause nothing      but trouble. A goat should be freshened once a year. So to      ensure a steady supply of milk it's advisable to have two      goats and freshen them alternately.    </p>    <p>      Before freshening a doe that has been giving milk, she must      be "dried off". The method used by most dairymen today is      the pressure system, which is simple enough. You stop      milking her. At the same time, restrict her water supply,      feed her dry hay and no grain at all. Pressure builds up in      the udder and she will be quite uncomfortable, bleating and      making a general nuisance of herself. Be kind and      affectionate, but don't give in and milk her. Milk      secretion will cease and reabsorption begin. If her      discomfort seems excessive, check with your vet. She may      have to be partially milked out. In any case, at the end of      a week she should be partially milked out to check the      udder for signs of mastitis.    </p>        <p>      The reabsorption cycle is very important, for during the      lactation period the doe has been losing more calcium and      other minerals through her milk than she has been taking      in. During her dry period the doe absorbs enough minerals      to ensure her health and that of her kids, and the quality      of yet another year's milk supply. She should have a rich      diet supplement of minerals. A balanced mix for this      purpose is available through your feed dealer.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DEHORNING AND MAINTENANCE</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>Dehorning.</em> Many goats are born hornless. Those      that are not should be dehorned to prevent injury to the      goat firmer and to other goats. Horns serve no purpose for      the domestic goat, and their early removal is little more      than the equivalent of cutting your nails, except that      normally it has to be done only once.    </p>    <p>      The earlier you dehorn the better. To the young, dehorning      is no more painful than a slight scratch or burn (depending      on the method) would be to you. The same cannot be said for      dehorning a mature goat.    </p>    <p>      Usually you can tell almost at birth if a kid will develop      horns. The hair will twist and tuft at either side of the      head where the horns will develop. If the hair lies      perfectly smooth, the kid will be hornless.    </p>    <p>      Should there be telltale curls on your kid, wait three or      four days, then carefully clip the curls and surrounding      areas with blunt-tipped scissors till you have an inch of      bare circle. The next day feel the spots where impending      horns are suspected. If the skin is loose, it was a false      alarm; the goat will be hornless, with at most perhaps a      couple of small harmless bumps for ersatz horns. If, on the      other hand, the skin is taut and a hard spot about a      quarter of an inch or so in diameter appears where the      incipient horn will emerge, prepare to act at once.    </p>    <p>      Dehorning can be accomplished by three means: chemically,      through cautery, or surgically. For the beginner, the      chemical means is recommended. The traditional method is to      stanchion the goat and apply caustic soda, available      commercially in a dehorning pencil. First clip the      surrounding area closely with scissors and then clippers;      grease all the skin approaching the horn bud well to      prevent the caustic from burning the skin. Then paint the      horn buds carefully with the caustic stick. <em>Always use      extreme caution when handling caustic.</em> Keep the kid      stanchioned for an hour. Before releasing, bandage the head      with two oversized Band-Aids, and keep it bandaged for a      day to prevent the kid from rubbing the caustic onto other      parts of the skin. Don't let the kid out in the rain the      first week; water will make the caustic run. That's it,      you've dehorned your first goat.    </p>    <p>      If the horn itself has broken through the skin, surgical      removal is advisable. However, neither cauterization nor      surgery is a do-it-yourself proposition unless you have      helped someone else with it several times first. Get      someone with more experience to teach you.    </p>    <p>      <em>Clipping.</em> Keeping your goat's hair trimmed is an      essential part of her maintenance, both for general      cleanliness and to discourage lice, ticks, and other      parasites. Clipped goats are more comfortable in the      summertime too, and a happy goat gives better milk.    </p>    <p>      The best time to give your goats an all-over haircut is      when spring is far enough along so you're pretty sure there      won't be any leftover winter nights that might foster      colds. But throughout the year, once a month the udder and      tail areas should be clipped. This prevents milk      contamination and reduces lice, which often initiate their      attack by the tail. If you have a severe louse problem,      while you're at it rub a little louse powder up and down      the spine. However, by brushing the goat's coat carefully      two or three times a week you should be able to keep lice      infestation down to a minimum, and your goat will love you      for it.    </p>    <p>      Clipping itself is simple enough. The operation and tool      involved are similar to those found in the old-fashioned      barbershop. (if you have more than two goats, you'll      probably find yourself wanting an electric clipper.)    </p>    <p>      1. Stanchion the goat on a milking stand but not in the      milking shed. Outside where the light is good is best.    </p>    <p>      2. Pet the goat with your free hand. Comforting her with a      few kind words certainly doesn't hurt. Start clipping      gently with the clippers. The ones specifically designed      for animals will leave just the right amount of stubble.    </p>    <p>      3. Always clip against the lay of the hair.    </p>    <p>      4. Make certain to stretch the skin tight when you trim      around the udder. Holding your shoulder against the doe      will steady her and prevent accidents.    </p>    <p>      <em>Hoof Trimming.</em> When living in the wild, goats trim      their hoofs naturally by wearing them down on hard ground      and rocky cliffs. Frolicking in a nice pasture and barn      living, on the other hand, don't give them enough wear. So      you'll have to do some paring.    </p>    <p>      Pick a day when the weather is damp, and you'll find the      hoofs will be more pliable. Should the hoofs be      particularly brittle, apply hoof oil two days before      trimming. Your tools are a sharp pruning knife and a      medium-grain file.    </p>    <p>      Stand beside the goat, facing her rear. As with clipping, a      steady conversational patter and an occasional petting are      good. You're in the country now and no one's going to look      at you strangely if you talk to an animal . . . farmers      know.    </p>    <p>      Pick up a leg and anchor it between your knees. The center      of the cloven hoof has a soft hump, known as the frog. This      should not need trimming under most circumstances. If it is      overgrown, be extra careful in tackling this area, since it      will be very painful to the animal (and probably yourself)      if you cut too deeply. Always trim a very thin slice at a      time. You can always cut more off . . . but you can't glue      it back on.</p>    <p>      The horny edges, or hoof, if the foot should be trimmed so      that they are even with the frog. This is why if you trim      the hoof regularly you won't have to worry about the frog.      It is softer and will wear itself down to the proper level.      Check carefully when you're through trimming to see that      the foot sits squarely on the ground. If it is uneven,      making contact only on the right or left, permanent leg      injury may result.    </p>    <h3>UDDER PROBLEMS</h3>    <p>      The health and well-being of the goat's udder is, of course      paramount in dairy production. Problems do arise      occasionally: but most of them are dealt with by simple      prevention.    </p>    <p>      Dehorning keeps goats from injuring each other. Roomy      stables prevent teats from being trampled. Briars should      not be permitted to grow in pasturage, since they easily      cut the udder, sometimes with ensuing infection. And, as      opposed to bees and chickens, bees and goats are not a good      combination. The bees seem to prefer stinging the goats on      the exposed udder over all other places, so have your hives      at the opposite end of the yard with their entrances facing      away from the goat pasture.    </p>    <p>      Mastitis. The worst udder problem is mastitis. Actually,      mastitis is a general term for any inflammation of the      udder, and not any specific disease. The reason a multitude      of sins fall under the same heading is that they all      manifest themselves in a similar manner . . . flaky or      clotted milk and a progressively swollen and sensitive      udder.</p>    <p>      Needless to say, mastitis caused by mechanical injury is      not infectious. Bacterially-caused mastitis, usually      produced by a Streptococcus, is. Avoid giving milk from a      doe suffering from mastitis to a dik. This is important to      remember, for udder infections tend to be more frequent      during kidding.    </p>    <p>      Mastitis is a problem for your veterinarian to handle, but      its early diagnosis is up to you. For this purpose use a      strip cup. This is a small container covered with an      exceedingly fine mesh. Draw a few drops of milk onto it      with each morning's milking. Small flakes or lumps in the      milk that become visible on the screen should lead you to      suspect trouble. Mastitis causes actual physical changes in      the udder and thus can permanently dry up the milk supply.      The earlier the treatment-usually      antibiotics-the better.    </p>    <p>      <em>Chapped Udders.</em> Chapped udders, particularly at      the teats, are caused by the same irritations that cause      chapped hands. Cleanliness and dry milking, that is, not      milking with wet hands, should prevent the problem.      However, if it does arise, rub glycerin onto the affected      areas twice a day and particularly after milking. Dr.      Naylor's Udder Balm-worth keeping around just for its      folksy nineteenth-century tin box-is even      better.</p>    <p>      <em>No Milk.</em> If a doe fails to give milk after      freshening and the udder swells properly, indicating an      ample supply, the diagnosis will probably be an obstruction      in the teat-this may also be the cause of "hard", or      difficult, milking in later stages of production-or      <em>atresia,</em> a blind teat which has no perforation at      all. The obstruction can usually be cleared without much      trouble. Opening a teat manifesting <em>atresia is</em>      also no major operation. But both should be done by your      veterinarian. On the other hand, when the veterinarian      comes, never let him go at it alone. Always watch. The more      you observe, the more you learn.    </p>    <p>      <em>Leaking Teats.</em> If you see your doe's teats leaking      when she comes into the barn to be milked, milk her more      often. Not only do leaking teats waste milk, they draw      flies and in general decrease the sanitary conditions of      your operation. The kind of milking problem that leads to      leakage can also lead to selfsucking. The pressure of the      milk becomes painful, and the doe nurses herself to relieve      it. This can become a hard-to-break habit that severely      curtails your milk supply. Again, the best cure is an ounce      of prevention. Milk on a three-times-a-day schedule rather      than two if necessary.    </p>    <h3>OTHER PROBLEMS</h3>     <p>      <em>Goat Pox.</em> You've heard of smallpox and chicken      pox. Well, if you're going to keep goats, look out for goat      pox. Not a serious disease, it manifests itself in the same      body eruptions as the other poxes. But do not use milk from      goats with the pox, which lasts around three weeks, because      it's highly infectious. Better yet, have your goats      vaccinated.</p>    <p>      <em>Parasites.</em> Parasites, external and internal, seem      to have a special affinity for goats. Here, as always,      prevention is the key word in care.    </p>    <p>      Many goat parasites make their home in the intestinal      tract; they or their eggs are expelled in the manure and      transmitted from goat to goat. A clean barn and rotating      pasturage minimize the spread of these parasites.    </p>    <p>      The presence of internal parasites should be suspected when      either a goat's stools are looser than usual or      constipation sets in and cannot be remedied by the addition      of more bulk to the feed. The animal becomes listless and      loses weight, all without any accompanying fever. A      microscopic examination of sample droppings by your      veterinarian or state Agricultural Extension Service should      ascertain if stomach or tapeworm parasite infection is the      cause. Remember, goats allowed to roam on a large, clean      pasture are less likely to pick up parasites than a crowded      herd.    </p>    <p>      Head grubs and follicle mites are two external parasites      that afflict goats occasionally. Be on the lookout for      unusual skin lesions, scabs, or ruptures, particularly      around the eyes, nostrils, and other mucous membrane areas.      Your veterinarian should be able to specify their cause and      remedy. Once you've observed and treated the different      varieties, you'll be able to handle the problem yourself,    </p>    <p>      All this may make it seem as if you'd better have a direct      wire to the vet. Not so. You might well go without seeing      him for a year or two. It's just that by being aware of      <em>potential</em> problems and taking the simple      precautions needed to ward them off, you're bound to have      healthier goats. And you'll probably be surprised to find      that a goat on the farm is really no more complicated to      care for than a dog in the city . . . except that you'll be      milking it two or three times a day instead of walking it.    </p>
