    <p>
                          <p>      When did it begin? Four years ago when we moved to an old      New England farmhouse with an acre and a half? Or maybe      three years back when we got the chickens (after tearing      down the chicken coop the year before)? I think myself that      the die was truly cast when we planted our first garden two      seasons ago. Anyhow-though we may never know exactly      how it happened-we now have a farm and are learning      to work it. We call our place Earth Haven.    </p>    <p>      We're fast approaching the end of our first year in the      country, and I feel it's time we shared some of our joys,      sorrows and lessons learned with those in MOTHERland who      are doing a similar trip ... or thinking and planning for      when they can.    </p>    <p>      First of all, I should mention that since we've lived in      and fixed up several run-down houses and have always made a      profit when we've moved-we had the advantage of      capital to launch our venture. Thus, the place we bought      was a real farm ... complete with some good fruit trees and      more equipment than we needed, etc.    </p>    <p>      Such a heavy investment nevertheless led to what may prove      our hardest lesson: the purchase necessitated a stiff      mortgage. So far we've been able to handle the payments,      but only by sacrificing our leisure and peace of mind. On      the other hand, this pressure has at least kept us from      putting things off. If there's something we can do for the      farm, it gets done ... it has to. Also on the plus side of      the situation is the fact that real farms come with lots of      land. If things get too bad, I suspect that we could bail      ourselves out by selling a couple of 15 or 20 acre plots at      the end of the spread and eliminating most if not all of      the mortgage.    </p>    <p>      Our second lesson-for which we're still paying the      bill-has to do with animals. It's great fun, of      course, to have all kinds of critters running around the      farm ... and that's what we've got: two cows; three pigs;      three sheep; 50 or 60 chickens; a handful of turkeys,      ducks, geese and rabbits; and, as of last week, one calf.      The folks at the feed store love us.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'm not saying that all these beasts are unprofitable.      The cows pay for themselves, and then some. We have all the      milk we want (and plenty of butter and whipping cream), and      what we don't use we barter with neighbors or make into      cheese. Even if we just poured the extra down the drain,      we'd still be ahead of the cost of buying milk and cheap      oleo at the store. The same with the chickens. We get all      our own eggs free, and those we sell-both at the door      and through a local co-op-more than pay for the feed      and the investment in buying and raising the chicks. And      the other creatures? Well, I like them and I doubt that      we'll get rid of them ... but in terms of dollars and  cents      they're not pulling their share of the load.    </p>    <p>      Another financial point, while I'm at it: We're still      learning how to price what we sell, but one fact has become      clear ... it's better to move all your wares for a little      under top dollar than to hold out for the maximum price and      not dispose of them all. We got in a lot of good hay, in a      year when good hay was going to be scarce, and expected to      do well from the crop. Now, however-because there's      been a shift in the area's animal population due to growing      feed costs, and because it looks like an early      spring-we probably won't get more than two-thirds of      our supply sold. Had we settled on a lower price earlier,      that hay would all be gone. Still, we learned something . .      . we keep our eggs and maple syrup about 7% to 10% under      store prices these days, and sales are great.    </p>    <p>      We've learned something else about selling home-grown      produce: word of mouth will bring you many customers, and      newspaper ads won't hurt ... but what's really done the      trick for us is a neat sign with changeable boards. This      notice hangs in our front yard and lets the people in every      passing car know what we're selling at the moment and how      much it costs. We haven't had our announcement up long, but      already more passers-by are stopping. We'd like to sell all      our fruits and vegetables at the roadside, but our location      is too remote. Most of our coming season's output will go      to a farmers' market in Springfield.    </p>    <p>      At this point I think we've discovered enough about rural      finances to be able to keep our place together. In the      immediate future the primary sources of Earth Haven's      revenue (apart from truck gardening) will be eggs and      hay.    </p>    <p>      We know the egg business works ... it's bringing in about      $40.00 a month at present, and we anticipate having four or      five times as many chickens as soon as we can raise them.      We'll hatch some of our own and buy chicks for the rest.      The roosters will be sold at auction.    </p>    <p>      Hay is another sure thing. Harvesting the crop is a lot of      effort, but those bales are worth money in the bank all      winter.    </p>    <p>      Financial matters weigh pretty heavily on our minds right      now with those mortgage payments hanging over us. . .      still, we do have the time to pick up plenty of      nonessential but handy bits of know-how. Here are just a      few.    </p>    <p>      FIREWOOD: As winter winds down and the mud season gets      underway, we find that we didn't get in quite enough      firewood last fall. Our wood lot is too soggy to enter now,      but we can quickly and easily pick up wood that has blown      out of the trees along our area's roads. We have a      2-1/2-ton truck and can fill it with good-sized fuel in      about an hour. While we're at it we bring the little stuff      home for the cookstove, so that we end up removing most of      the clutter from the roadside in the bargain. Now that the      snow is pretty well gone, we're going to hang a couple of      containers off the side of the truck and also pick up any      discarded bottles, cans, etc., in the area at the same      time.    </p>    <p>      DUMP PICKINGS: Although I've been a compulsive trashmonger      since I was a kid, I learned something new this year. Many      small and mediumsized companies have dumps other than the      town facility. These rubbish heaps yield mountains of      lumber from old shipping crates, pallets and the like . . .      plus fiber, steel and plastic barrels, pails, etc. Best of      all, the private garbage pile is usually where the outfit      puts its rejected products.    </p>    <p>      We've just finished a beautiful steam bath building made      from shipping crates and a heavy, all-weather vinyl      material of unknown original purpose. Now we're planning to      construct a pig house and do some effective (if not      attractive) fencing with one of the loads of pallets we      brought home from an industrial dump ... and I'm writing      this report on paper from the same source.    </p>    <p>      FIREPLACES: When we built a fireplace last fall, our best      sources of information were <em>The Foxfire</em>      <em>Book</em> and Vrest Orton's The Forgotten Art of      Building a Good Fireplace. If you can't get the latter from      the library, it's available for $2.50 from the people who      put out Yankee magazine (Dublin, New Hampshire 03444) . . .      or from MOTHER'S Bookshelf.    </p>    <p>      A tip of our own invention is to build a plywood form with      outside dimensions that correspond to the inner      measurements of the fireplace you intend to create. That      form made it really easy for beginners like us to lay the      bricks. If you have trouble removing the plywood afterward,      you can burn it out.    </p>    <p>      USDA: If you're trying to make a living from your land, let      your neighborhood extension service know. Ask for the man      in the agribusiness department and tell him what you're      doing. He'll put you on the appropriate mailing lists.      You'll get a lot of garbage about chemical fertilizers and      poison sprays (complete with large type disclaiming any      responsibility for damages incurred from their use). You'll      also, however, find useful market information and      announcements of workshops where you may or may not profit      from the program, but will invariably learn some good      things from the other people present.    </p>    <p>      WOOD COOKSTOVE: We wouldn't be without one, but only      recently did we learn of the many hidden places that must      be cleaned regularly to make a wood cookstove burn more      efficiently and bake better. In particular, there's bound      to be a little piece that opens or comes off for clearing      out the area under the oven.    </p>    <p>      MOVING ANIMALS: If you want to get pigs, chickens or what      have you from one place on your land to another, the      easiest way is to turn them loose and then throw ears of      corn in the direction in which you want them to move. It      takes a little while, but the critters don't get upset      and/or frightened.    </p>    <p>      VETERINARIANS: Pick a vet before you need one desperately      ... and get more than one recommended. We had a sick cow,      and being new at raising cattle-we asked a      neighboring farmer what to do. He suggested a particular      doctor who came, gave the animal some medicine and said      that she'd be down a couple of days and then come along      fine. A day later we realized that something was wrong and      called another vet who almost saved her in spite of the      delay. She died of an easily recognized condition caused by      someone's feeding her a quantity of food to which she was      unaccustomed.    </p>    <p>      ADVICE FROM OTHER FARMERS: Our neighbors are very helpful      when we hit a problem, and yours will likely be the same.      But check with more than one person when you have a      problem, and use a little common sense of your own.      Remember that even though the local farmers have a lot of      valuable knowledge and experience, they also probably use      chemical fertilizers, poison sprays, growthstimulating      hormones and all the rest of it. And remember, too, that      there's more than one way to do things right.    </p>    <p>      THE FINER THINGS IN LIFE: If there are many luxuries you      think you have to have-if you can't live without hot      water or get on without plenty of nice clothes, the latest      albums and a warm house-I don't think you can survive long      enough to get a farm working. Doing without things we're      used to is psychologically hard on most of us ...      but-if you can keep smiling-the beautiful      things seem to more than make up for the hardships. When      and if you start to get discouraged, remember that the      first year is bound to be the toughest.    </p>    <p>      Those initial twelve months were certainly long ones for us      ... we've never worked so hard in our lives. The highlights      were building the fireplace, having 31 people on hand for a      fourday, farm-style Thanksgiving and the birth of our first      calf. We're happy, healthy and looking forward to the      challenges of the next year at Earth Haven.    </p>
