                    <h5 id="byline">      by Harvey Mitchell    </h5>    <h3>      From MOM's mailbox: Two handy racks for cutting your logs      without breaking your back    </h3>    <p>      The Rack and the Rollway: couple of readers offer their      views on how wood should be cut.    </p>            <p>      <strong>JUST OVER A YEAR AGO, IN THE</strong>      September/October 1988 issue of MOTHER, we featured an      Alaskan firewood cutting rack designed by longtime      homesteader and contributor Ole Wik. Plagued by the      familiar problems of pinched chain bars, precariously      stacked timbers, and sawteeth dulled by contact with the      frozen earth, Ole poked two lines of saplings into the      ground, stacked full lengths of narrow logs between them,      and tied the tops of the saplings together so they wouldn't      splay open.    </p>    <p>      His vertical rack allowed him to turn about two dozen      small-diameter logs into firewood in less than 15      minutes-without the worry of dancing over tumbling rounds      or the waste of wrestling a large piece into place while      the saw idled.    </p>    <p>      Yet what's good for the goose may not be so for the      gander-at least not according to Milo Lamphier, a      woodcutting Montanan who submitted his wood-rack design      just after we'd accepted Ole Wik's. Milo may have been      disappointed when his submission was returned, but he was      confounded when he saw the setup that was published and      promptly resubmitted his offering with a challenge to      compare the two.    </p>    <p>      But the story doesn't end there: Not too long afterward,      another wood burner, Canadian Harvey Mitchell, mailed us      his description of a simplified bucking rack-one that he'd      built in about 10 minutes using some of the timbers waiting      to be cut. It, he wrote, was the perfect solution to a      temporary log surplus.    </p>    <p>      We're thankful for all this correspondence. Cutting      firewood is enough of a chore; if committed wood burners      among MOTHER's readers have a tool or technique that makes      their woodcutting hours go more smoothly, we're happy to      share it!    </p>    <h3>      THE FOLDING WOOD RACK    </h3>    <p>      <em>By Milo Lamphier</em>    </p>        <p>      <strong>I JUST INVESTED TWO HOURS OF AN</strong>afternoon      and about $15 worth of materials to make a firewood-cutting      rack that's already proved to be one of the biggest      time-savers on my place. It's a 6' x 8' stud-lumber frame      that folds flat for storage or transport. Unfolded, it      takes up a space about 9' deep and supports the logs in a      safe and comfortable sawing position.    </p>    <p>      All told, I used just ten 2 x 4s for the entire project:      seven 8- and three 6-footers, plus a handful of 16-penny      nails and seven 1/8" x 3 1/2" carriage bolts with hardware.      You wouldn't notice this at first, but I also planned my      lumber purchase to minimize waste and thus keep the cost      down. How? I purposely bought 8' studs so I could trim them      down and use the tails as log stops, rather than paying a      higher price for odd-length pieces that are less likely to      be on sale.    </p>    <p>      Putting the rack together was easy. First, I cut five of      the long pieces down to 72", and drilled a 1/8" hole in the      center of each leftover tail. Then I bored a hole 1' from      the end of each of those 6' pieces, and sank two more holes      12" from the ends of the two remaining full-length studs.    </p>    <p>      Next, I put the rack platform together by spacing the 6'      uprights 16" apart and nailing a cross-board to the ends.      Then I bolted the five log stops in place, and cut and      fastened the second cross-board to the top of the rack      (just below the stops, so they'd lock when rotated      perpendicular to the uprights).    </p>    <p>      Finally, I attached the two 8' legs to the sides of the      frame, after first drilling a bolt-sized hole about 4" from      each upper corner. To brace them, I nailed another      cross-board between their lower ends.    </p>    <p>      Using the rack, I can convert half a dozen o r so 8'      timbers to stove length in a matter of minutes. First, I      trim the ends of the logs, then make a full-length cut      between each of the uprights. I usually leave the bottom      log uncut to protect the lower crosspiece from the chain      saw. The tilted platform keeps the logs from binding up, or      from tumbling down once they're cut. It also takes the      strain out of loading and unloading the wood, which can      take a real bite out of your workday.    </p>    <h3>      THE LOG ROLLWAY<br />    </h3>    <p>      <em>By Harvey Mitchell</em>    </p>        <p>      LAST SUMMER, THROUGH A STROKE of luck, I was given five      truckloads of green wood, cut in lengths of 4' to 8'. As it      turned out, some of the pieces were rather large to try to      heft into the kind of vertical rack recommended by Ole Wik,      so I devised a much simpler temporary version, which took a      lot less work to install.    </p>    <p>      I first laid down a solid log to act as a support for the      ends of several long logs, set at a perpendicular and      spaced side by side about 24" apart. At the opposite end,      where the logs met the ground, I drove stakes into the      earth and nailed each one securely to the log adjoining it.      They serve as stops for the timbers ready to be cut.    </p>    <p>      The rack works just as it would appear: You feed logs onto      the rollway and stack them two or three deep at the lower      end. By cutting consistently to the left of the stakes,      you'll be assured of obtaining stove-length billets as you      buzz through the pile. As an afterthought, I later placed      all the stakes to the right of the parallel logs, nailed      directly into the side of the trunks. That made a stronger      connection and also put the rollway logs square in the path      of the saw blade, to prevent the teeth from digging into      the ground when nearing the end of each cut.    </p>    <p>      As you can see from the photo, I can cut and stack wood of      any size using this simple method. What you may not be able      to see clearly are the several dozen lengths of dry timber      stacked upright against a crossbar tied between the trees.      I pass that along from my Alaskan experience; it prevents      cured wood from getting buried in the snow or freezing to      the ground. You can easily carry it indoors to be cut when      you need it.    </p>
