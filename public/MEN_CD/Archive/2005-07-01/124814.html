        If you spot a large bee buzzing around your home that looks like ashiny bumblebee without its fuzz, it's probably a carpenterbee.<br /><br />Carpenter bees may want to share your home sooner or later if youhave a wood house or a wood deck. Females bore half-inch-wide holesinto wood and then excavate a burrow to raise their young, oftenreusing old nests year after year.<br /><br />Extension entomologists agree that the best way to preventcarpenter-bee damage is to keep wood surfaces painted (stains don'tdeter them nearly as well). Some people have good luck plugging beeentry holes with aluminum window screening held in place with ducttape. After a few weeks, remove the duct tape and fill the holewith wood putty.
