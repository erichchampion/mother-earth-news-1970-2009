                       <h5 id="byline">      by Victor A. Croley    </h5>        <p>      My twelve-year-old Girl Scout granddaughter came bursting      into the room, bubbling with excitement. "Grampa! Grampa!"      she squealed. "I ate a live crawdad and earned my merit      badge."    </p>    <p>      "Doesn't sound very appetizing to me," I protested.    </p>    <p>      "Not bad with plenty of salt," insisted Jeanie. "Of course,      if you have a fire you can boil them and they turn red and      then their tails taste just like shrimp. But if you're      desperate and starving you can eat them raw and they have      lots of protein and can save your life. That's how I got my      survival merit badge."    </p>    <p>      "Well, I'm sure glad you survived," I said, sending her      along with an encouraging pat on the fanny.    </p>    <p>      Jeanie was right: Crawfish are great survival food . . .      partly because you can find them almost everywhere. They're      one of the most widely distributed crustaceans and thrive      on every continent except Africa. Of the more than 300      known species, no less than 100 have been identified in the      United States (where they're variously known as crayfish,      crawdads, mudbugs, mini-lobsters, stonecrabs, etc.).    </p>    <p>      The critters-whatever you call them-look like      very small lobsters. Each one is equipped with two claws in      front, six or eight slender legs which permit it to walk      around on the bottom and a flattened, broad tail which can      be used as an emergency oar to send the mudbug shooting      backward through the water as if jet-propelled.    </p>    <p>      Nature made crawfish very prolific . . . a wise provision      since they have a host of enemies. They're the principal      food of the river otter and are eagerly sought by mink,      raccoons, possums and other animals. Even dogs and house      cats have been known to catch and eat crawdads. Water      birds-gulls, herons, ibis, cranes and      storks-feed on the tasty morsels and are adept at      catching them in shallow water. Bullfrogs, catfish, bass      and other game fish seek them too, and bait shops at many      fishing resorts sell stonecrabs in quantity.    </p>    <p>      Hungry humans are also keen hunters of crawfish . . . which      are easily captured, without bait or elaborate      paraphernalia. In shallow, running water you can catch the      little critters by overturning rocks in the streambed and      snatching your prey as they try to escape. <em>(Scare the      creatures with a stick brandished in front of them, and      they'll dart backwurd. . . straight into a waiting hand or      tin can.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>    <p>      The mature crawfish also lives beside still waters and in      swampy areas, where it protects itself during dry seasons      by digging a burrow deep enough to hold water at the      bottom. (These holes are the birthplaces of the young.)      Such a hideaway is usually marked by a mud castle around      the opening and is often large enough that one can reach      down with hand and forearm to grab the occupant. If not, he      can usually be teased or forced out with a small stick.      Caution: a mudbug's front claws-like those of the      lobster-have considerable leverage and can give you a      pinch which, although not severe enough to draw blood, may      be quite sharp and painful.    </p>    <p>      I well remember catching crawdads in their mud-ringed holes      along creek banks and marshy meadows when I was Jeanie's      age. My friends and I weren't worried enough about survival      to eat them raw . . . but-like all small      boys-we were always hungry, and boiled crawfish tails      tasted mighty good.    </p>    <p>      Sometimes, too, I went with black chums and their families      on mass picnic expeditions to the Missouri river bottoms.      On those festive occasions, a very special technique was      used to catch the yearling crawfish in quantity. A chunk of      pork liver was tied to a stout cord fastened to a length of      bamboo pole. The bait was then tossed into quiet water in      the swampy bayous, away from the swift currents of the      river, and allowed to rest on the bottom for ten or fifteen      minutes. When it was slowly raised to the surface, it would      be covered with tightly clinging crawdads! The creatures      would release their hold as they were lifted from the water      and drop-a dozen or two at each haul-into a      sort of butterfly net of cheesecloth or mosquito bar      carefully positioned beneath.    </p>    <p>      In no time at all we would have a twelve-quart pail of the      squirming, wriggling three-inch crustaceans. Then the women      of the party-who already had a bonfire burning and a      large kettle of salted water boiling furiously-would      take over. The crawfish were dumped into the bubbling      liquid, and almost instantly changed color from the dull      green of living creatures to the bright red of tasty cooked      tidbits.    </p>    <p>      We'd shell out the snow-white, steaming hot morsels like      peanuts, sprinkle them lightly with salt and pop them into      our mouths . . . and I'm amazed even now to think of the      quantities we ate! I suppose, looking back on it, that our      feasts were rather wasteful since we devoured only the      tails and discarded the rest for birds, raccoons and other      scavengers.    </p>    <p>      By the way, you don't need access to a stream, river or      swamp to enjoy a mess of crawdads now and then. The duck      ponds and lily pools in municipal parks often contain large      populations of the crustaceans and-if you live near      such a source-you might perhaps get permission to      remove some of the surplus. Denver's City Park has a pond      that swarms with the beasties. When I lived there, we often      went down with a bit of bait on a string and snagged a      two-quart milk carton full: two or three dozen three-inch      crawfish . . . enough for a gourmet dish of bisque,      etouffee, stew, pie, soup or whatever. Personally, I like      my mudbugs plain, piping hot, sprinkled with salt and      drenched with a bit of melted lemon butter. Mmmmm!    </p>    <p>      Still, for the benefit of the ultrafastidious, I'll give a      master chef's directions for preparing and cooking      mini-lobsters: "Wash the crawfish well in several changes      of salted water. Drop them one by one into a rapidly      boiling pot. You may add salt, a few grains of cayenne and      two teaspoons of caraway seed. The addition of minced      vegetables to the stock at this time makes a very good      soup.    </p>    <p>      "Boil the creatures for five minutes and leave them in the      water until cool. Pull out the middle tail fin and the      intestinal vein along with it. Shell the crawfish, set them      aside and boil the vegetables until tender. Reheat the      crustaceans and serve them with lemon and drawn butter      after the soup course."    </p>    <p>      With so many tasty ways available to prepare the catch,      it's no wonder that crawfishing has always been a favorite      seasonal sport in many Southern States . . . principally      Louisiana, where the shallow bayous and swampy areas have      proved favorable to the crawdads' development.    </p>    <p>      By a happy coincidence, the crustaceans' ideal      habitat-a pond or swamp that dries up (or can be      drained) during part of the year-is also just right      for the growing of rice. It's been found recently that      crawfish can be raised as a rotation crop in rice fields,      and their farming promises to become an important      agricultural industry.    </p>    <p>      I'll admit that-outside Louisiana, the home of this      booming business-crawfish farming is little known.      Mudbugs are found in most of the other states, however, and      there seems to be no reason why they can't be grown in      quantity in regions other than the extreme South. In fact,      homesteaders who have farm ponds, ditches or swampy areas      on their land may find it worthwhile to give this crop a      try.    </p>    <p>      No special technique is required to grow crawfish. Just      stock the water with mature crustaceans, at the rate of      about 25 pounds to the acre, and let nature take its      course. Each female produces from 100 to 600 eggs which she      carries beneath her tail until they hatch. The pond or      waterway should contain plenty of organic      matter-cattails, bulrushes and other water      weeds-to provide food for the young, which grow      rapidly on a diet of decaying vegetation.    </p>    <p>      Once the body of water is stocked, no attention is      necessary other than to protect your crawdads from      predators: birds, raccoons, bullfrogs and fish. Judicious      trapping or shooting should keep these marauders in check      and permit a mudbug population explosion.    </p>    <p>      Some farmers in Louisiana report production records of up      to 1,000 pounds per acre. That's a lot of delicious,      highprotein eating (and maybe some handy cash, too) with      very little work on your part. Any way you look at      him-as a survival ration, gourmet dish or money      crop-the versatile mini-lobster is a useful fellow to      know.    </p>
