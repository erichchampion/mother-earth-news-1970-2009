            		<p><strong>THE OLD TIME FARM MAGAZINE</strong></p>		    <p>      From beer to bread: A sampling from a country gentleman's      daily plate    </p>    <p>      THE FOLLOWING RECIPES ARE REPRINTED from a 1915 edition of      <em>The Country Gentleman,</em> a farm journal stuffed with      practical country-living tips and home-baked gems. So get      out your teacup and start measuring!    </p>    <p>      <strong>Persimmon Beer.</strong> <em>Ingredients:</em> Five      pounds of lump sugar, three gallons of water, a quarter of      a teacupful of yeast, a slice of toasted bread, two lemons,      and eight persimmons. Boil the sugar and the water for an      hour. When it is cold, add the persimmons (sliced), the      juice and peels of the lemons, and the yeast on the bread.    </p>    <p>      Let stand for two or three days in a tub covered with a      thick cloth. Then strain and bottle it. It will be ready to      drink in five days after it is bottled.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nut Sandwiches.</strong> Nuts may be used very      successfully in sandwiches for the school luncheon. Black      or English walnuts, hazelnuts, pecans, and hickory nuts may      be used in the following recipes.    </p>    <p>      These sandwiches may well take the place of cake in the      lunch box, as they supply the required sweets in a      wholesome and delicious form. Well-baked bread, cut into      even slices and buttered, should form the basis of all      sandwiches.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nut-Prune Filling.</strong> Wash prunes and soak      overnight in enough water to cover. Allow them to simmer on      the stove until the fruit is plump. Sweeten slightly,      remove the prunes from the juice, and dry them out in the      oven. Cool, remove the stones, and crush the fruit with      chopped nut meats, using one to two nut meats for each      prune.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nut-Watermelon-Preserve Filling.</strong> Drain      watermelon preserves, chop, and mix with a few chopped nut      meats.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Nut-Cottage-Cheese Filling.</strong> Mix a few      chopped nut meats with some cottage cheese, season with      salt, and moisten with milk or cream. Add a little sugar if      you want a sweet sandwich filling.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Rye Bread.</strong> Scald half a pint of milk and      add half a pint of water. When the liquid is lukewarm add      half a cake of compressed yeast that has been dissolved in      two tablespoonfuls of cool water and half a teaspoonful of      salt; then stir in sufficient rye flour to make a batter.      Beat thoroughly; cover and stand aside for 3 hours.    </p>    <p>      Add sufficient rye flour to make a dough stiff enough to      knead. Knead thoroughly; then pound it for 5 minutes. Shape      it at once into loaves and put into greased pans. Stand      aside for an hour to an hour and a half, until it is very      light; brush with water and bake in a moderately quick oven      for an hour.    </p>    <p>      <strong>REPRINTED COURTESY OF THE CURTIS PUBLISHING      COMPANY</strong>    </p>
