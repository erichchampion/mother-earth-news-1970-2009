                 <h5 id="byline">     by LARRY M. HACKENBERG    </h5>    <p>      If you're interested in low-cost, non-energy-intensive,      do-it-yourself housing-and who isn't these      days?-here's new-old way to make that dream come      true.    </p>       <p>      Planning to build your own house or cabin? Want to save a      bundle on materials AND add to your dwelling's visual      appeal? Then by all means, use green wood in your project!    </p>    <p>      Now please hear me out! I know the idea of constructing a      house of unseasoned wood registers with most folks like      fingernails scraping on a chalkboard . . . but doggone it,      fresh-from-the-tree lumber is [1] only one-fifth to a third      as expensive as kiln-dried pine, [2] no harder to work      with?in my opinion?than "ordinary" materials, and [3]      stunningly beautiful. It's also <em>real,</em> in a way      that Formica and stucco and linoleum can never be.    </p>    <p>      Sure, raw timber <em>does</em> shrink as it dries out. You      can circumvent this problem, however, with the right      construction techniques . . . and I'm sure that?once you've      compared the aroma, appearance, and sheer good karma of a      green wood house with the aura of any other wooden      structure?you'll agree that shrinkage is of trivial      importance. (Well, <em>almost</em> trivial.) Besides: Green      wood is organic, non-energy-intensive, and just plain fun      to work with! How else can a guy build a home?even one with      an outhouse and wood heat?for a family of six for under      $6,000?    </p>    <h3>TALK ABOUT A GOOD BUY</h3>    <p>      Yep, that's all I spent on the 1,800-square-foot structure      that keeps the rain off my wife, myself, and our four kids.      Working together, we constructed the 100% green oak cabin      ourselves in nine months for a cost <em>far</em> below what      we'd have paid a contractor to do the job. And, as you can      see from the accompanying photos, our humble abode is      really quite livable.    </p>    <p>      And that's not all. Over the past five years I've built      four other green oak cabins?ranging in floor space from 450      to 700 square feet?which we rent out for additional income.      None of the four cost more than $2,000. The smallest, in      fact, set us back only $1,100.    </p>    <p>      One thing I've discovered from these experiments is that      green oak lends itself well to all the conventional      construction techniques used for foundations, windows,      doorways, partitions, etc. My own house, for instance, is a      fairly standard stud-wall structure with studio ceiling.      The various "raw" materials I used, though, cost much      less?and look a heckuva lot better?than the usual drywall      and veneer paneling.    </p>    <p>      Take it from me: when you buy freshly hewn and cut wood,      you're getting what you pay for in terms of an all-round      pleasurable building experience.    </p>    <h3>WHERE TO GET "RAW" MATERIALS</h3>    <p>      Simply go to your local sawmill and tell them what you      want. Traveling around the U.S., I've noticed an amazing      abundance of these outfits . . . in fact, I'd hazard a      guess that perhaps 75% of the population lives within 100      miles (a reasonable shipping distance) of a sawmill. If you      have any trouble at all locating a mill, your State Forest      Service?or any large contractor for custom-built      homes?should be able to put you onto one . . . which will      probably be closer than you think.    </p>    <p>      Green lumber is sold by the board foot (144 cubic inches)      and where I live, a board foot of green oak costs around      10 cents. That's for full dimension lumber, too . . .      two-by-fours, in other words, that really measure 2" X 4"      rather than 1-1/2" X 3-1/2" (which is the current size of a      lumberyard 2 X 4). This means you end up saving money two      ways: first, because you buy direct from the mill . . . and      second, because you get stronger materials that you'll use      less of.    </p>    <p>      I buy oak exclusively, simply because it's available where      I live (Virginia). Other suitable varieties of wood can      usually be found in areas where oak is not abundant. For      example, spruce?though not as strong as oak?is plentiful in      Colorado, and cypress (an ideal wood to work with) is      common throughout the South. Poplar is another fine      building material, as is California redwood. All I can say      is, look around . . . you'll find what you need.    </p>    <h3>HOW GREEN IS GREEN?</h3>    <p>      I use lumber when it's very green, and by that I mean a day      away from having been a tree. My philosophy is "the sooner      you build with it, the better".    </p>    <p>      I don't air-dry the wood I use at all, for several reasons.      First, if the sap-laden lumber is stacked and left to sit,      it stains very easily and can quickly become ugly.      Secondly, air drying?when done properly-requires too      much time, space, and attention. (Authorities say you      should allow one year of drying time for every inch of a      board's thickness: a year for one-by-sixes, two years for      two-by-fours, and so on. Follow this rule and you'll be      walking around hip deep in curing wood clear into the      1980's before you finish your cabin!) In addition to that,      green oak can be cut with less difficulty, bends fewer      nails, and is all-round nicer to work with than after it's      seasoned. Thus, if you ask me, the air drying of wood      earmarked for construction is not only unnecessary . . .      but maybe even counterproductive!    </p>    <p>      By the way, I also don't treat my lumber with any      preservatives-although I <em>have</em> applied linseed oil      to one living room wall to bring out its grain?because      green oak is naturally decay resistant. Most <em>other</em>      woods DO need to be preserved, though, so be sure to have      some creosote on hand if you're planning to work with      spruce, poplar, etc.    </p>    <h3>LET THE BUILDER BEWARE</h3>    <p>      Remember at all times that green wood is ungraded lumber.      This means, among other things, that you should check to be      sure all load?carrying pieces?studs, joists, beams,      columns, etc.?are free of any splits, cracks, or bark sawed      into the wood. Set blemished pieces aside to use later in      less critical areas.    </p>    <p>      The fact that you're working with ungraded lumber also may      mean that you're in violation of building codes. This is      worth checking out on a local level. Here in Albemarle      County, Virginia, the codes are (as far as I know) among      the strictest in the state . . . and they prohibit the use      of ungraded stock <em>unless</em> the material can be      proven superior in strength to kiln-dried lumber. With oak,      fortunately, this is no problem.    </p>    <p>      To paraphrase Will Rogers, I never met a building inspector      I didn't like . . . but then again, your experience and      mine may not be the same. The only way you'll find out for      sure what <em>your</em> code requirements are is to go      downtown and apply for a building permit. <em>Before</em>      ?not after?you start construction.    </p>    <h3>ABOUT SHRINKAGE . . .</h3>   <p>      As sure as a toad croaks, all green wood shrinks. The idea      when it comes to making a house out of this material, then,      is to work <em>with</em> the shrinkage and not try to fight      it. (Like it or not, the forces of shrinkage are mightier      than you are and will win every time!)    </p>    <p>      It's therefore important when you design your home to      incorporate <em>overlapping details</em> into your plans .      . . details which?by their very nature?will not allow great      yawning gaps to open up in your walls, floor, or whatever.      Similarly, a good rule of thumb is to avoid the use of      boards wider than six inches wherever possible, since such      pieces of lumber, naturally, tend to shrink more than      narrow ones.    </p>    <p>      Remember that the greatest overall size reduction in a      plank of wood occurs at right angles to the annular growth      rings of the tree from which it was cut. This means?in      actual terms-that a 1" X 6" X 10' board will contract      about 1/16" in the 1" direction, approximately 3/8" in the      6" direction, and something under 1/4" in length (see Fig.      1). Less dense timbers?pine or fir, for instance?will      shrink slightly more.    </p>    <p>      Green wood will complete 70 to 80% of its total shrinkage      within three to four months after it leaves the      sawmill-assuming the climate is warm and dry?while      for the next year or so, only minimal contraction will      occur. To keep inordinately large stresses from      accumulating in the wood, then, unseasoned lumber should      not be allowed to dry out too quickly during the first few      months of use. Hence, the best time to purchase and use raw      lumber is in the fall, when the sap is down and the weather      is cool.    </p>   <h3>NAILS AND NAILING</h3>    <p>      If you plan to work with green oak, be sure to buy only      common nails: 8d for one-inch-thick stock, and 16d for      two-bys. Box nails are unsuitable because their smaller      shanks allow them to bend more easily than common nails.    </p>    <p>      And you don't need coated nails when you're working with      raw lumber! The coating is only there to increase holding      power . . . and believe me, if you use oak you'll have no      problem with the nails falling out or pulling loose. As a      matter of fact, you can count on destroying the wood before      removing a misdriven spike.    </p>    <p>      One-by-sixes (no doubt the size material you'll work with      most often) should be nailed at intervals of three feet      along their entire length to preclude undue warpage. Reduce      this spacing to two feet if you want the planks to stay      absolutely flat forever. And remember that the      <em>maximum</em> distance between nails under conditions of      damp climate, northern exposure, etc., should      <em>never</em> be more than six feet.    </p>    <p>      Drive nails in pairs at each station along the board, as      shown in Fig. 2. Ideally, the fasteners should be placed      exactly 1-1/2" in from the edge of the board and no more      than 2-1/2" to (at most) 6" from the ends.    </p>    <p>      Each nail also should be hammered in at an angle of 60 to      70°-measured from the flat surface of the      wood?and oriented so that the tip points toward the edge of      the plank (Fig. 2). This allows the wood to bend the nail      slightly as shrinkage occurs . . . which is what you want.      You <em>don't</em> want the nail to hold so tightly that      the board develops enough stress to split down the middle.      (Which is exactly what will happen if you pound the nails      in perpendicular to the plank's surface.)    </p>    <p>      You can nail two-by stock?two-by-fours, two-by-sixes, and      so on-in the same manner as you would kiln-dried pine or      fir, because the greater thickness of such studs makes it      unlikely that the wood will ever split or warp.    </p>    <p>      Ditto for four-by material. I've installed 4" X 6" X 10'      beams with two bolts at each end?and the middle left      unsecured?and not seen any trace of twist or warp, ever.    </p>    <p>      Joists, as usual, can be nailed top and bottom to a box      frame at the periphery of the floor or ceiling, with two-by      bridges attached at interior points.    </p>    <h3>BOARD AND BATTEN SIDING</h3>    <p>      Here's an example of a shrink-proof covering for a wall      that's both good-looking AND easy to build.    </p>    <p>      In case you're unfamiliar with board and batten      construction, the general configuration is presented in      Fig. 3. To make this kind of siding, all you do is fasten      1" X 6" and 1" X 4" boards vertically?and overlapping?to      the horizontal members of a basic stud-wall frame.    </p>    <p>      Begin by nailing one-by-sixes to the horizontal studs so      that there is no more than a two-inch gap left between any      pair of neighboring boards. Then you can affix the      battens?made of 1 " X 4" stock?to the siding boards (Fig.      3). An inch of overlap should exist where the battens and      boards meet.    </p>    <p>      Be certain, when you attach the battens, to hammer the      nails in at a 60 or 70° angle . . . and be doubly      certain to drive the nails in <em>pairs,</em> one spike to      each edge of the wood. If you were to drive only a single      spike into the edge or center of the batten?as is usually      done in this kind of construction?the strips would later      curl so much that you could poke your little finger between      them and the boards underneath. On the other hand, if you      attach your siding as shown in Fig. 3, the boards will pull      each other together tightly as they shrink . . . giving you      a sturdy and curl-proof structure.<br />    </p>    <p>      Lamentably, <em>some</em> of the green battens?perhaps as      many as five percent? <em>will</em> tear themselves apart      as they cure, no matter what . . . especially on      south-facing walls. When this happens, all you can      do-if it bothers you?is go around the house after the      wood has dried and replace the split members. Still, this      isn't as bad as it sounds . . . and when you're finally      done, you'll have walls to be downright proud of.    </p>    <h3>THAT'S NOT ALL</h3>    <p>      Unfortunately, in the last 2,000 words or so I've only been      able to give you the most abbreviated introduction to the      art of building with raw lumber. I haven't told you about      the marvelous furniture you can make from green oak . . .      or about the energy-efficient homes I'm designing around      asymmetric frames which [1] are incredibly strong, [2] use      little wood, and [3] can be assembled quickly at a      reasonable cost . . . or about the 930-square-foot house      you can build right now for $4,000 . . . or about, well, a      few hundred dozen other things.    </p>    <p>      If you want to learn more about how to build with uncured      lumber, you might want to read my book <em>The Green Wood      House</em> (which should soon be available from The      University Press of Virginia, Midmont Lane,      Charlottesville, Va. 22902). But better still, go out and      get some fresh-from-the-sawmill planks and timbers and work      with them . . . <em>that'll</em> teach you more about the      subject than anything that's ever been written.    </p>    <p>      I've always believed that low-cost dwellings ought to be?in      a word?beautiful. And that's just what the Green Wood House      is to me, in more ways than one.    </p>
