                <p><strong>      A FINE NEW BOOK ON LIVING WITH LESS:    </strong></p>        <p>      Remember when you were a kid and you went fishing and put      that first cast way out there and looked down at your reel      only to find a mass of tangled, backlashed line . . . and      remember how blasted long it took you to unknot all-the      knots and de-loop all the loops and otherwise put your      Wondercast into working order once again?    </p>    <p>      Well, pardon the less-than-perfect analogy, but many of      MOTHER's readers have been trying to do the same kind of      thing for a considerable number of years now. The name of      the game is "Simplify Your Lifestyle", and-though the      idea itself sounds easy enough-most folks have      discovered that untying the multitude of knots that bind us      all to snarled-up society is a trying task indeed.    </p>    <p>      Which, of course, is why publications such as MOTHER, and      organizations such as the Center for Science in the Public      Interest, have popped up in recent years: to help provide      the how-to information needed by people who are trying to      lessen the impact of their lives on the world at large (and      vice versa).    </p>    <p>      And, we're happy to say, CSPI has just made a rather nice      contribution to that effort by putting together an      extraordinarily useful 324-page paperback book entitled 99      Ways to a Simple Lifestyle. It's a brand-new release . . .      but we suspect (and certainly hope) that the volume will be      around for a very long time to come.    </p>    <p>      Between the covers of this modestly mimeographed book are      ninety-nine detailed essays that explore ways to conserve      our natural resources-food, fossil fuel, water,      wildlife, people, health, land, and everything else that's      customarily devastated by modern man-by leading a more      conscientious, less wasteful, do-it-yourself life. And if      you're thinking such a book would have to cover a rather      monumental mass of information on Heaven-knows-how-many      subjects, you're absolutely right. That"s precisely what 99      Ways to a Simple Lifestyle does.    </p>    <p>      For instance, you can sit down with this volume and      learn-within a single reading-how to: keep a      furnace operating properly, avoid aerosol sprays, build a      yurt, consume less meat, plant fruit trees, make and repair      furniture, care for a garden, ride a bicycle, live      communally, buy a flushless toilet, cut hot water costs,      eat wild foods, select and make and mend clothing, camp and      backpack, stop smoking cigarettes, purchase a car,      refurbish an old home, make compost, dehumidify rooms in      the summer, save water, bake bread, avoid unnecessary auto      travel, use natural pesticides, repair a leaking faucet,      watch your weight, choose gasoline, exercise without      equipment, join a craft co-op, fight utility companies,      take care of your feet, and do 68 other equally liberating      things.    </p>    <p>      In other words, what we have here is the proverbial primer      to low-impact lifestyles. Obviously, the book cannot cover      each topic in all-inclusive depth . . . but the basic facts      are thoroughly explained and-in many cases-      illustrated to make it easy for the reader to build a sound      base for pursuing a different kind of "good life": the kind      that's good for everybody.    </p>    <p>      So hop to it, all you dreamers and doers. Order up a copy      of 99 Ways to a Simple Lifestyle from the Center for      Science in the Public Interest, Reports Department, 1757 S      St. N.W., Washington, D.C. 20009. The price is a mere $5.50      for just-plain people, or $11.00 for institutions and      profit making organizations.-T K.    </p>
