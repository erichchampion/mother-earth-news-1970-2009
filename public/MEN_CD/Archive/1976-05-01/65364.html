        <p>Well, it's like this. After running that one page article about Wallace Minto's solar-powered wheel in the last issue, we got so intrigued by the idea that a couple of us flew down to Florida to see Mr. Minto's little (six feet in diameter) prototype "engine" in operation.</p><p>And it works. Even just pushed outside and "powered" by some mirrors reflecting sunlight on its bottom, it works. Not great (under those conditions), but well enough to make us want to see what a wheel 20 feet or so in diameter would do.</p><p>And that's what you see above. MOTHER'S Minto Wheel under construction. We hope to have some test reports for you in our next issue.</p>
