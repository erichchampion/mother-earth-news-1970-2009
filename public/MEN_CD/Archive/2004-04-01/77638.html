                        <h5 id="byline">      Edited by Carol Mack    </h5>    <p>      <strong>New England & Maritime Canada</strong>    </p>    <p>      The wood frogs are in full chorus. Deer brave the open      fields, hungry for tender, new grass. It's time to put up      birdhouses, and to feed and re-mulch fruit trees and      berries. Tomato and pepper seedlings need to be      transplanted into bigger pots. Start brassicas early but      wait on squash and melons until three to four weeks before      setting them out. A few pots of fast-growing annuals like      morning glories and nasturtiums give a jump on the blooming      season. Outside, weeds pull easily from the asparagus patch      and perennial beds. When the ground can be worked, sow      hardy greens, parsley, cilantro, onions, leeks, peas, and      fava and garbanzo beans. May brings the return of the tree      swallows, swooping and twittering as you plant carrots,      beets, brassicas, annual flowers, herbs and lettuce. Summer      squash and swimming are within sight, at least for the      optimistic and the adventurous.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Mid-Atlantic</strong>    </p>    <p>      April is the crucial time to get a handle on pests like      harlequin bugs - enlist your chickens for a      search-and-destroy mission. Continue biweekly sowings of      carrots, beets, chard, radishes, spinach and some late      garden peas. When the first asparagus spear emerges, hoe      the patch and mulch it loosely with hay. Try sowing some      white Dutch clover between the rows of peas and carrots      after a vigorous hoeing. Thin both carrots and beets within      two weeks of emergence. About the fifth of April,      transplant bulb onion seeds and sets. Take a gamble on      setting out some early tomatoes, but be prepared to protect      them from frost. Hill the potatoes when they are 8 inches      high and squish the potato bugs or call in the chickens      again. Come May, it's time to plant warm weather crops and      weed all that stuff, too - phew. Hoe annual weeds on      dry days, and hand-pull long-rooted biennials and      perennials when the soil is wet.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southern Interior</strong>    </p>    <p>      It seems to be a Southern tradition to direct-sow summer      veggies on Good Friday. Last year, monsoon-like rains made      it impossible to plant until late May. Hopefully, we can      return to our traditional April timetable this year and get      summer staples like squash, pole beans, butterpeas, corn      and okra in the ground just like Grandma used to do.      Whenever you plant squash, be sure to give it plenty of      room to spread out- thin squash seedlings to two      plants per hill with hills 2 to 3 feet apart. For healthier      plants and bigger yields, inoculate pole beans, cowpeas      (aka field peas) and butterpeas with nitrogen-fixing      bacteria before sowing. Soak okra seed for 24 hours in warm      water for better germination. Then turn your attention to      spring-flowering shrubs. Azaleas, spiraea, viburnum and      forsythia can be pruned after flowering, and May is prime      time to do so before energy-sapping heat makes the job      worse.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Gulf Coast</strong>    </p>    <p>      What a season for wildflowers! But if you want to plant      them, remember that most of the ones in bloom now      germinated late last summer, and mark your calendar      accordingly. Continue planting heat-loving crops. If we      have a wet spring, expect early blight fungus to be a      problem on tomatoes. Adequate spacing (try them 3 to 4 feet      apart in the row) and removing the bottom leaves up 12      inches will improve air circulation and reduce infection.      Otherwise, apply low-toxicity wettable sulfur to the      foliage (be sure to cover the bottoms of the leaves) to      keep this disease in check. The sulfur also will reduce the      build-up of spider mites if we have a dry spring. Pecans      need a foliar application to supply zinc. Anticipate that      the pecan case-bearer caterpillar may be wreaking havoc on      developing nutlets in early May, and ask your local      extension office for organic spray programs.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Central/Midwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gardening has taught me one important lesson: Do not rely      on the past year's weather for this year's planting      schedule. Because every spring is different, watch the      long-range weather reports. Purchase a good soil      thermometer and monitor it carefully. Seed packets contain      important information about optimum soil temperatures and      weather conditions, or read about each variety in gardening      books. Sudden spikes of warm temperatures unfortunately out      of our control - may cause broccoli, lettuce, greens      or onions planted in these months to bolt. You can,      however, control cool-weather growing conditions by using      season extenders such as row covers and mini-hoop      greenhouse tunnels to raise the soil temperatures and keep      a blanket of warmer air near the soil surface. These will      speed up growth of cold-tolerant crops planted throughout      these months and create better conditions for the tender      crops planted in late May.    </p>    <p>      <strong>North Central & Rockies</strong>    </p>    <p>      Gardeners with cold frames or plastic-covered hoophouses      already are enjoying a harvest of early greens, while the      rest of us are still looking for spots warm enough to      plant. Even a small angle of slope to the south can      dramatically increase soil warmth. Large rocks or concrete      walls collect the sun's heat during the day and protect      from frost at night. We plant cold-season crops up to a      month early in these areas, including arugula, kale,      lettuce, pac choi, pea, radish and spinach. Inside, it's      time to start flats of seedlings, to be ready for      transplanting when the soil finally warms. Start tomatoes,      peppers and broccoli extra early only if you can transplant      them to larger pots to prevent stunted root growth.      Consider saving your own seed this year - it's      relatively simple for many varieties. (See "Grow Your Own      Seeds," October/November 2003.) Mountain gardeners, whose      growing conditions vary widely, will especially benefit      from long-term selection of plants best adapted to their      particular sites.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Pacific Northwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      The great tomato race of 2004 starts now. Harden off young      plants by exposing them to outdoor conditions for a week to      10 days before planting. Red mulch, hot caps and other      insulating devices help develop productive plants faster.      Heirloom and beefsteak tomatoes are absolutely luscious,      but don't overlook fine extra-early varieties such as      `Legend' or `Oregon Spring' for a harvest starting in July.      Lettuce, spinach, arugula and other greens sown outside      will appreciate cool April temperatures. For spring salads      that have a variety of flavors, colors and shapes, scatter      seeds of a mesclun blend in a 4-by-4-foot area. As the      greens continue to grow, harvest the outer leaves. Other      April sowings include many of our favorite flowers,      including zinnias, sunflowers and cosmos, as well as beets,      carrots, radishes and virus-resistant peas such as `Oregon      Sugar Pod II,' `Cascadia' and `New Century.'    </p>    <p>      <strong>Southwest</strong>    </p>    <p>      At higher elevations, lovely warm April afternoons may fool      you into thinking summer has arrived, but wait until late      May to plant out tender seedlings like tomatoes and      peppers. Straw bales stacked around transplants will shield      them from intense sun, wind or cold while they harden off,      and the bales can be covered easily on cold nights.      Throughout April, sow cold-hardy crops, including lettuce,      greens and radishes. Plant cilantro in mid-April near where      the bean patch will be planted in early June. The flowering      cilantro attracts a parasitic wasp that naturally helps      control bean beetles. In mid-May, direct seed summer crops      like corn, squash, melons and root vegetables. At lower      elevations, follow the same planting advice, but warmer      nights allow for starting a month earlier. Plan ahead now      for summer water conservation by landscaping with      drought-tolerant plants, mulching with straw, using drip      irrigation and setting out rain-collection barrels before      the monsoons arrive.    </p>    <p>      <em>Our thanks to the following for their contributions to      the Almanac: Roberta Bailey, FEDCO Seeds, Waterville,      Maine; Cricket Rakita, Southern Exposure Seed Exchange,      Mineral, Virginia; Lori Hardee and Karen Park Jennings,      Park Seed Company, Greenwood, South Carolina; William D.
