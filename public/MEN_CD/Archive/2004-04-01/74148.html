    <p>
                        <p>      For many years we noticed the tiny holes in the leaves of      different garden plants before we actually went      investigating. We were continually frustrated at seeing      only the holes, but not actually seeing the bugs. It was      after reading about these little mysteries that we realized      flea beetles are given the name "flea" because they have      great jumping back legs and actually leap off their chosen      leaves when big monsters, like gardeners, approach. We      hadn't been observant enough to notice this escape      maneuver.    </p>    <p>      You have to look closely to see these tiny creatures,      members of about 370 species of one subfamily of the beetle      order Coleoptera. The adults can be from 1/16 to 1/5 of an      inch long, depending on the species. Under a hand lens, the      different species usually will be a dark color, but a few      species will show some light-colored stripes. At least a      dozen different species are happy munching on common garden      crops. Some species will feed on more than one plant crop,      but many are tied to single crops or closely related crops.    </p>    <p>      Flea beetles are found throughout North America. Adults      overwinter and lay eggs in early spring on or in the soil      near the base of the host plant. The egg-larval-pupal      stages take four to five weeks, after which the new adults      emerge in search of fresh greenery. The thin, white larvae      do some feeding on roots of the host plants and leave snaky      markings on potatoes, but the adults are the hungriest      competitors for our garden groceries, and most damage is      done to the foliage. Adults are attracted to young plants      and chew the typical "shot-holes" in the underside of      leaves. Some plants that attract these beetles are cole      crops, corn, eggplant, grapes, potatoes, spinach, sweet      potatoes, tobacco, tomatoes and cucumbers.    </p>    <p>      The best perennial defense against flea beetles is a      healthy, nutritious garden soil. When crops grow quickly      and with balanced nutrition, the growth can compensate for      slight damage. The easiest tactic for immediate defense is      to use row covers in the early spring. The beetles eschew      chewing on older plants, so the covers simply can be      removed as the season progresses.    </p>    <p>      Presuming you are rotating crops, you won't trap beetles      under the covers that remain from the same crop the      previous year. Crop rotation, though obviously good for      other reasons, does not fool the very mobile adult flea      beetle. Shallow hoeing for weeds will do double duty as      flea beetle eggs are exposed to the air and predators. A      few `Chinese Daikon' or 'Snow Belle' radishes work well as      a flea beetle catch-crop when interplanted with cole crops.      (For more pest-control tactics, see      <em>www.attra.ncat.org/pest.html</em>    </p>    <p>      A second or third generation of flea beetles can appear in      a single summer, so when putting out late plantings for      fall, cover them when young, too.    </p>    <p>      Flea beetles also feed on many nongarden plants, including      Virginia creeper, pokeweed, horse nettle, pigweed and wild      mustard family plants.    </p>    <p>      <em>- John Stuart</em>    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
