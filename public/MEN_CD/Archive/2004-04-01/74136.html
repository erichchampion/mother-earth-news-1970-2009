                    <h5 id="byline">      By <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> Editors    </h5>        <p>      It's a great time to be an organic food shopper, whether      you're new to organics or a veteran devotee. Since 2002,      when the U.S. Department of Agriculture regulations for      organic foods, which set production and handling standards      that all food labeled "organic" must meet, went into      effect, the organic food business has been booming. Growing      concerns about toxic pesticides, inhumane treatment of      livestock animals, E. coli outbreaks and mad cow disease      continue to fuel the growth, as does people's desire to      support a more eco-friendly food chain. (Next issue, we'll      bring you an article about yet another reason to buy      organic-the declining vitamin and mineral content of      conventional produce.)    </p>    <p>      More and more supermarkets are expanding their organic      sections and moving those products to more prominent store      positions. (For organic brands to look for, see list, Page      77.) Local food co-ops are featuring a wider range of      products than ever before, and they are buying from local      producers whenever they can. There are even growing chains      of natural foods supermarkets: Whole Foods has 146 stores      in 27 states and Canada, and Wild Oats has 101 locations in      25 states and Canada.    </p>    <p>      Food industry giants, including Mars and General Mills,      have purchased smaller organic companies and introduced      their organic brands to many mainstream shoppers, while      additional small producers in this country, and many      others, are starting new organic companies, often dedicated      to artisan-style, high-quality organic production on a      modest scale. In either case, everybody wins-more      wholesome, flavorful organic products are being produced      and sold, more land is being farmed sustainably and more      livestock animals are being raised humanely.    </p>    <p>      Many of these new, premium organic products offer      extraordinary tastes. A few months ago at MOTHER EARTH      NEWS, we tasted several kinds of organic soybeans and      discovered how much better black soybeans taste than the      more-common yellow types. And our favorite cookie now is      the Newman's Own Organics Fig Newman.    </p>    <p>      Some items are more expensive than standard fair, but you      get what you pay for, right? Foods bringing that rare,      homegrown flavor back into our favorite recipes are worth a      premium price whether they're available in our      supermarkets, online or at a local farm. Some of these      products come from just down the road and others come from      half-a-world away. Although we normally encourage you to      buy as locally as you can, we've found that some of the      topnotch imports remind us of how good our U.S. food can,      and should, be.    </p>    <p>      A great example is the certified organic Bionaturae tomato      paste we also tasted recently here at MOTHER'S office: It      had the richest, sweetest tomato taste we've ever      encountered short of homemade. According to the company,      the paste is made from heirloom tomato varieties vine      ripened and handpicked on a network of Tuscan family farms      in Italy. The tomatoes are milled to an ultra-smooth      consistency and packed in glass to preserve the fresh      taste. This stuff is perfect with fresh herbs atop a dish      of steaming pasta, or on a pizza crust ready for the oven,      or for stirring into some soups and fish dishes. And like      many European products, this paste has no added sodium, so      the tomato flavor isn't overpowered by extra salt.      Bionaturae also makes olive oil and fruit nectars, and      we're eager to see if these products are as exceptional as      the tomato paste.    </p>    <p>      Yet another example is South Carolina-based Anson Mills'      whole-grain, cold-milled cornmeal, which we tested for our      "Uncommon Corn" article (see Page 60). Anson's freshly      ground, organic heirloom corn made a corn bread that we all      agreed was the best we had ever tasted, with a rich corny      flavor and pleasing chewy texture. It made us all eager to      try growing and grinding our own cornmeal.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Look for These Organic Brands</strong>    </p>    <p>      You will find increasing numbers of organic products      turning up on the shelves of your favorite      markets-sometimes in a special organic food section,      and sometimes right beside the conventional counterparts.
