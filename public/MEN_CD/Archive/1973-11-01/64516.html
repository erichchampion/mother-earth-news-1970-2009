                        <p>      (YE OLD WATER WHEEL - FOR A BOUNTIFUL OF ENERGY)		</p>		<p>				The old water wheel-used in the United States for      grinding grains and producing energy at the beginning of      the Industrial Revolution-has declined in popularity      since this country's rural electrification program was      initiated in the early 1930's. There are, however, still individuals who refuse to give up      the virtually free power source.    </p>    <p>      One such person is Thomas      Oates of Route 74, Gerton, North Carolina. Sparkling,      crystal clear water has splashed over his water wheel for      more than four decades now . . . to provide his woodworking      shop, office and home with electricity since long before      transmission lines were installed in this onetime remote      mountainous area of the Tar Heel State.    </p>    <p>      Tom, an agile 71-year-old craftsman, owns and operates The      Manual Wood-Workers-a crafts and souvenirs      center-where thousands of people stop each year to      sample sourwood honey and to buy handmade cedar churns,      dulcimers or cornshuck dolls made by the local      mountaineers.</p><p> Although Oates doesn't depend on his current      metal water wheel as completely as he relied on his first      wooden one back in 1933, it-and quick-flowing      Hickory Creek-still provides his business with      standby power.</p><p> Tom-who was born and raised near      Asheville, North Caro lina-started his first      hydroelectric project during the depression, "when I had      plenty of time to think about things".Oates adds, "My brother sent me three direct current (DC)      generators from New York City, and I had the water ... so      the two just fit together."    </p>    <p>      A total of sixteen woodworking      machines and a battery of over fifty lights were hooked      into that initial electrical system, to satisfy all of      Oates' energy needs eleven years before commercial lines      were run through his section of the country.</p><p> "Even after      the power company put electricity in here," Tom chuckles,      "I kept my generation unit going because it was more      dependable. With the old utility company, the power was off      more than it was on."    </p>        <p>      Because of this constant interruption of service, Oates      wired his shop and home for both DC and Alternating Current      (AC). "I kept every other light hooked up to DC and I still      use the same setup today. I call it my security protection      system because I can leave half the lights burning without      them costing me a cent," Tom says.    </p>    <p>The wheel Tom now uses      is made of steel and measures 15 feet in diameter.      It was manufactured in 1914 by the Fitz Waterwheel Company      of Hanover, Pennsylvania (the firm is no longer in      business) and was originally used for milling grains. The      Greenville, South Carolina City Waterworks then bought the      apparatus secondhand and ran a generator with it until the      utility sold it to Oates 26 years ago. "it cost me $200 to      buy the wheel and another $300 to fix it up and transport      it to my site here on the edge of Bearwallow Mountain      (elevation 4,249 ft.)."</p><p> While standing amidst the cluttered      workshop that overlooks his hydroelectric plant, Tom      describes how he funnels Hickory Creek's flow through a      136-foot-long sluice-an artificial channel for      diverting water-to his water wheel. "It's lasted me a      good long time," he says, "and I've never had a bit of      trouble with it.All I've done is look after the sluice and make a few minor      adjustments along the way. But this fall I think I'll have      to build another one because the wood is finally starting      to rot."    </p>    <p>       The sluice is 5 feet wide, 12 feet high and      directs water over the wheel (making this an overshot      system) to provide approximately 17 horsepower at 15 rpm.      By stepping this rotational force through a series of      belts, jack shafts and seven pulleys, Oates uses it to turn      his electrical generator at approximately 800 rpm.</p><p> And      that's where the bind comes in with most homebuilt      hydroelectric systems: matching the setup's output to the      amount of power needed. That is: A DC generator of a      certain size will have to run at a specific speed to      produce enough electricity to light, say, a 100-watt bulb.      If you suddenly turn on two more 100-watt lights, however,      all the bulbs will glow only weakly unless you also      increase the rpm of the DC generator to meet the increased      energy demand.</p><p> Oates overcame this problem by placing a      sluice gate a few feet behind the spillway which regulates      the amount of waterflow over the wheel.By means of pulleys, Tom can open or close this gate from      his shop or home.    </p>    <p>      "It took a lot of experimenting," Oates      recalls, "to get the system working right. One time when my      daughter was a baby, she yanked on a pulley-cable and      opened the sluice gate all the way-making the water      shoot full-blast over the wheel-and it blew out every      clang light on the place." After that, Tom put in a safety      mechanism to prevent a recurrence of the accidental power      surge. "It just took a lot of trial and error to hook up      this operation. The pulleys are from all over and I doubt      if you can find them very easily anymore. When my son and I      rebuild the sluice this fall, we'll be putting in another      generator, but I'm getting a little old for this kind of      thing now. The system has worked for me though, and it's been fun to      play with."    </p>    <p>      Even when the water's low in Hickory Creek, the      stream supplies enough power to create electricity. Tom      uses a 5-horsepower, 220-volt DC generator which produces      110 volts at 800 rpm. This setup is capable of running 50      or more 60-watt light bulbs ... more than enough to light      Oates' office and run his shop and home.</p><p> "It's easy enough      to do," says our country woodworker. "All it takes is a      little figuring and some work." If you have a good stream      of water flowing on your property, you might well look into      the idea of harnessing it with your own hydroelectric      plant.    </p>

Oates uses a series of nine drive pulleys connected by canvas belts to transfer the power from the water wheel to the generator and woodworking equipment. This setup enables our mountaineer craftsman to produce enough electricity to run more than 50 light bulbs.
