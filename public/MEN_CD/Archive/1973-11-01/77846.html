        <hr /><hr /><p><strong>THE NEWSPAPER YOU READ TODAY MAY BE YOUR FOOD TOMORROW</strong>, according to a Denver University microbiologist. Dr. Brooks D. Church says that fungi can turn discarded paper into a protein-rich food supplement ... and the mold produced contains as much as 50 percent protein. Currently it's used in animal feed, and - if approved by federal health agencies--could supplement human food, Dr. Church says. Fungus has been grown successfully on the leftovers from paper factories, grain mills and breweries...and even on feed lot cattle wastes and manure. The Green Giant Company's Minnesota corn and pea cannery and an Iowa milling firm are now testing the idea in pilot plants.</p>
