                        <h5 id="byline">      By Susan Sides    </h5>    <p>      Why let your garden just "fall" asleep when<br />      you can make it "spring" awake?    </p>        <p>      "Fall is not the end of the gardening year; it is the start      of next year's growing season."    </p>    <p>      - Thalassa Cruso    </p>    <p>      THE BETTER PART OF THE APRIL DAY was still ahead of us and      the digging forks were already heavy in our hands, when my      gardening friend spoke: "Nature's inefficient! She gives us      scads of gardening chores in spring -right when our bodies      are the flabbiest. Then by the time we get all toned up and      in shape, it's fall and there're almost no garden chores      left."    </p>    <p>      I didn't have a rebuttal for this apparent injustice to      home growers. I just grunted in agreement, wiped my brow      and bent back over my fork. But garden writer Thalassa      Cruso has a partial solution: Why not knock off some of      next spring's chores this fall? That's right, do them      now-while your biceps are brimming with stamina and your      garden duties aren't crowding together like root-bound May      seedlings.    </p>    <p>      So here's a check list of 20 ideas for fall plot      improvement:    </p>    <p>      <strong>1. Test.</strong> Autumn's the best time to send      soil samples off for analysis. The labs aren't swamped with      work, so you get results back faster than in spring. The      soil's generally drier, which makes sampling easier and      more accurate. And there's more time for any of the      recommended amendments you add to break down and work their      way into the soil.    </p>    <p>      Your county extension agent may provide inexpensive (or      free) testing. Some other sources: Necessary Trading      Company (328 Main St., New Castle, VA 24127), Peaceful      Valley Farm Supply (11173 Peaceful Valley Rd., Nevada City,      CA 95959), Woods End Laboratory (Old Rome Rd., Box 4050,      Mt. Vernon, ME 04352) and A & L Labs (call 901/527-2780      in Tennessee or 209/5294080 in California for the location      of the lab nearest you).    </p>    <p>      <strong>2. Clean up</strong> . Remove decaying crop litter      to the compost heap and you eliminate choice overwintering      sites for insects and diseases. It's a heck of a lot easier      to do this chore section by section throughout the fall      than to put it off and battle icy ground and frozen fingers      later. Inspect the crop roots you pull up for hints of      belowground problems like nematodes. Burn any foliage from      diseased plants. And cover that compost pile with plastic      or a thick layer of straw to shed snow and rain.    </p>    <p>      <strong>3. Cultivate.</strong> Tilling soil in fall can      reduce pest troubles next spring. It interrupts the life      cycles of insects by exposing underground grubs, eggs and      pupae to hungry birds and cold temperatures. Tilling also      helps break up the rough soil of a new garden site:      Winter's freezes and thaws will pulverize those churned-up      clods.    </p>    <p>      <strong>4. Sow cover crops.</strong> If you're more      interested in improving soil fertility than in reducing      insect pests, don't leave open, cultivated soil. Instead,      sow that ground in hardy cover crops such as winter rye      mixed with hairy vetch (or, in mild-winter areas, banner      fava beans). Cover crops eliminate erosion, improve soil      structure, provide spring compost material and keep      nutrients from leaching down out of reach. A thick planting      of a fall cover crop is a special blessing if you're      starting a new garden where grass or weeds have reigned      supreme: It can cut next year's weeding headaches in half.    </p>    <p>      <strong>5. Pile leaves.</strong> Corral those fallen flags      of fall in a chicken wire bin. They'll come in handy as      mulching material, future compost makings and leaf mold for      the bottom of seedling trays next spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>6. Fend off frost.</strong> When frost threatens,      pick the fruits of tender fare like tomatoes, sweet      peppers, cucumbers, eggplants and sweet potatoes. But have      cloches, hot caps, blankets, baskets and other covers ready      to protect hardier crops.    </p>    <p>      <strong>7. Grow hardy</strong> . Sow winter-hardy crops      like kale, spinach, mustard, lettuce (types like oak leaf      and Boston), parsley, chives, Swiss chard and Chinese      cabbage. (This last crop is especially well adapted to low      light and temperature conditions.) Protect them with simple      cloches of clear plastic over PVC arches, wooden cold      frames or recycled windows atop bales of hay.    </p>    <p>      <strong>8. Hasten maturity.</strong> A dose of manure tea      or foliar fertilizer may help crops like lettuce, spinach,      broccoli, cauliflower, Swiss chard, Brussels sprouts and      Chinese and regular cabbages reach maturity before killing      frost.    </p>    <p>      <strong>9. Tend to tools.</strong> In most gardens, spades      and trowels have played hide-and-seek all over the plot by      the time fall arrives. Round the wayward tools up, wipe      their dirt off (scrub them if necessary with a wire brush),      oil them with vegetable oil (to fend off rust), and store      them away for winter. Drain and store all hoses, watering      wands, nozzles and sprinklers before freezing weather can      damage them. Disinfect all seed-starting equipment with one      part liquid chlorine bleach to nine parts water. (Let it      dry before storing.) And put away any trellising, stakes,      plastic sheeting and spunbond material that you're not      currently using.    </p>    <p>      <strong>10. Winterize engines.</strong> Drain or run out      all the gasoline from lawn mowers, tillers and string      trimmers. Otherwise, water can condense in the tanks over      winter and make for hard starting next spring. Then      disconnect the spark plugs and store the machines under      cover to keep them dry.    </p>    <p>      <strong>11. Make a list.</strong> Just because you know      <em>now</em> that next spring you'll need such items as a      new hoe, mower blade, piece of wire fencing and red paint      for the tool handles (it's hard to lose red-handled tools)      doesn't mean that you'll remember all those things the next      time you're at the hardware store or the flea market. Why      not make a list of those garden needs and tape it to your      car dashboard?    </p>    <p>      <strong>12. Tend perennials.</strong> Jerusalem artichokes      (sunchokes), rhubarb, horseradish and asparagus can be      planted in fall. In areas of mild winters, so can grapes,      blackberries and raspberries (not strawberries, though,      except in the far South). Leave the dead foliage of      established asparagus to catch snow (and thus moisture)      until spring. Then you can smash it down to provide extra      mulch. Cancel this counsel, however, if you have asparagus      beetle problems. In that case, cut down all spent asparagus      tops and burn or compost them. It's also a good idea to add      a layer of aged manure every fall or two to an asparagus      bed. Prepare the sites for such spring bulbs as daffodils,      crocuses, tulips, lilies of the valley, irises and peonies      by digging in lots of compost and bonemeal. Then check the      timetable in your area for when to divide and replant.    </p>    <p>      <strong>13. Mark roots.</strong> Searching through snow or      frozen ground to find overwintering root crops is no fun.      So mark the borders of those plantings now (mulch the areas      when the crops' tops die back).    </p>    <p>      <strong>14. Grow garlic.</strong> Sure, you can plant      garlic in the spring, but it will grow bigger and better if      you set it out the prior fall. Poke individual cloves into      the ground about an inch below the surface and spaced three      inches apart. Then don't pass GO-don't even stop to sip      lemonade-but immediately mulch your new bed. (That way      you'll save yourself hours of weeding hassles next spring.)      First, put down a layer of leaves (smaller or shredded ones      work best), then add clean straw to hold that down. The      garlic stalks will sprout right through the covering now,      then grow like crazy next spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>15. Start spring greens.</strong> Sow lettuce,      spinach, corn salad, cress and parsley under a spunbond row      cover two weeks before that first fall frost is due. You      may get as little as 50% germination from those seeds come      spring, but they'll produce the earliest-and      best-tasting-greens around.    </p>    <p>      <strong>16. Take in tender herbs.</strong> In most      climates, cold-sensitive herbs such as rosemary, lemon      verbena, scented geraniums and tender lavenders and sages      won't survive unless they're brought indoors for winter.      There they can continue to provide you with fresh      seasonings. Kate and Fairman Jayne of Sandy Mush Herb      Nursery say these tenderfoot plants need tough treatment      (even though it may seem like blatant plant abuse). First,      wait until <em>after</em> the first hard freeze to dig the      herbs. Then set them on the garage floor for several days.      This shocks the plants into a very short (but necessary)      dormancy period. Next, prune back the stems and pot each      herb in a container that is two inches wider than the root      ball. Bring them indoors, and water <em>minimally</em>      until their stark branches show signs of perking up, and      only moderately after that.    </p>    <p>      <strong>17. Overwinter hardy herbs.</strong> Oregano,      chives, mint, parsley, lemon balm, hardy lavenders,      culinary sages, thyme and savory are a few of the herbs      that can handle what winter dishes out. But don't prune      them right before winter-that encourages vulnerable new      growth. Hold off on trimming until late winter or early      spring. However, you may want to mulch them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>18. Take herb cuttings.</strong> To have the      benefits of fresh herbs-either tender or hardy-in winter,      you can start cuttings from them anytime from two months to      two weeks before the first frost date. Clip of sections      that are three to four inches long. Strip off the leaves on      the lower third to half of each piece, and dip it in a      commercial rooting hormone. Then put it in a light soil      mix. Keep the soil moist but not flooded.    </p>    <p>      <strong>19. Save seed.</strong> Don't forget to collect      seed from your favorite plants (nonhybrids only): that      tastiest tomato, the last summer lettuce to bolt, the      cheeriest flower. You can also take steps to save seed from      biennials. Mark and mulch all root crops (except radishes),      and leave a few to bloom and go to seed next spring.    </p>    <p>      <strong>20. Pat yourself on the back.</strong> Pick a sunny      afternoon-one of those sharp, bright days that only fall      brings-pull out a lawn chair, and set it down right smack      dab in the middle of your garden. Lie back and relax. Think      about all the beauty and success your garden has given you      this year. Note those areas where you overplanted or      underweeded. Look at the whole plot without any positive or      negative judgments, and see what new things it tells you.      Then close your eyes and take a restful nap.    </p>    <p>      You've earned it.    </p>
