                    <p>      <strong>With little more than seeds and a sketchbook, you      can start dabbling in artful gardening.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      By Susan Sides    </h5>        <p>      cabbage, Rosa d' Amerique lettuce and soon-to-bloom      calliopsis.    </p>    <p>      AREN'T THOSE KIDS' PAINT with-water books great? I used to      think they were magic. I was so in love with them that I'd      deliberately pester my grandmother until she'd pull one out      to quiet me. Then I'd sit at the kitchen table with a cup      of water and a little brush and " paint" for hours. It was      always so exciting to see the little dried dots in the      pictures explode into rich primary hues at the touch of my      wet brush.    </p>    <p>      Seeds are like that: little dry dots that explode with      color. (just add water!) And seed can be found to produce      almost any hue imaginable, making us free to sow bold paths      of color off the tips of our fingers with the sweep of an      arm.    </p>    <p>      The gardener using plants as pigments can control shapes      and textures as well: sinuous pea tendril, delicate corn      silk, puckered spinach green and smooth radicchio. All you      have to do to take advantage of this full palette of color      and design is look for attractive ways to combine different      plants--vegetables, flowers and herbs-in your garden.    </p>    <p>      Furthermore, artful gardening is not only colorful but      three-dimensional, aromatic <em>and</em> practical.      Practical? Obviously, you'll produce edible, as well as      attractive, results (no "starving artists" here). But      there's more to it than that. By intermingling vegetables,      or vegetables with flowers and herbs, you encourage      beneficial insects and confuse the homing-in devices of      harmful ones.    </p>    <p>      If you place plants with similar cultural requirements      together, tending them becomes easier too. For instance,      the bright fruits of graceful pepper plants look even      better when set off by a low border of      silver-fronded-gazanias--and both will last all season      under semidry conditions. Heavy nitrogen feeders like      lettuce and cabbage are well suited to sharing the same      spot. And combining two crops that usually require      botanical sprays will not only consolidate your work but      also limit any drift damage to beneficial insects.    </p>    <p>      Your living garden arrangements can benefit from other      functional considerations, as well. For example, calliopsis      appreciates the support offered by the sturdy, open stems      and leaves of squash and melons. Summer lettuce prospers in      the dappled shade cast by chili peppers or dill. A ground      cover of borage or basil can help keep tomato roots moist.      And thyme or hyssop planted among cabbages or other      brassicas repels the white cabbage butterfly.    </p>    <p>      "But," you moan, "I can't sit down in spring with only a      boxful of seed packets and <em>imagine</em> which plants      would look nice next to one another, let alone judge which      are compatible."    </p>    <p>      To tell the truth, I can't either. That's where an      overturned bucket and a small notebook come in handy. Once      every couple of weeks during the growing season, I sit on      that bucket, pad in hand, and look at what's around me. I      note the date, jot down what does and doesn't look good,      make educated guesses, then rough-sketch and label      groupings of plants that may make things more attractive      next year. It takes only about 30 minutes, and it's a lot      more fun than weeding!    </p>    <p>      When spring comes around again, the past season's ramblings      and sketches supply inspiration for arrangements of the new      year's vegetables, herbs and flowers into groupings that      will be more attractive and make better use of space, labor      and supplies. New combinations suggested by books and      friends can also be tried out on an experimental basis.    </p>    <p>      The practical aspects of dabbling in the art of gardening      are real, but, if the truth were known, I'd probably have      to admit that I'm basically still enchanted by the      paint-with-water concept.    </p>    <p>      "As gardeners, we're in the business of repackaging      water-into peppers, into tomatoes, into flowers," says Ian      Robertson, a local organic grower and instructor.    </p>    <p>      Ah, well, that explains everything. Somewhere along the      line I just put down my paintbrush and picked up a hoe.    </p>
