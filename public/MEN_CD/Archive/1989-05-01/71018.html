            		<p><strong>COUNTRY LORE</strong></p>            <p>      We haven't tested every one of these, but readers say they      work!    </p>    <p>      MY MOTHER TAUGHT ALL HER CHILDREN to wash store-bought      berries (especially strawberries) in tepid water with a      dash of vinegar in it before rinsing them. Try it; you may      be surprised to see the numbers of tiny insects that are      flushed out of their comfortable hiding places by the sting      of the acidic vinegar. I often remember <em>my</em>      experiences with these stowaways when I see people eating      fruit right off the supermarket shelf. In addition to      swallowing pesticides and herbicides, they may be getting      some "bonus" protein, too.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Lillian S.Murphy<br />      Rohnert Park, California</em>    </p>    <h3>Six-Pack Scaffolds</h3>    <p>      It would be hard to imagine a product with less redeeming      social value than the "sixpack net," that assembly of      plastic loops used to hold beverage cans together. Not only      is the material all but indestructible in the environment,      it also poses a potential threat to pets and wildlife that      might get caught in its nonbiodegradable nooses.    </p>    <p>      Several years ago, though, I visited a local restaurant and      asked them to save their plastic horrors for me. When I had      a ready supply of the six-packers, I used a stapler to      assemble them into a dandy net for my peavines--a support      that laughs at weather and even lets sunlight through. Best      of all, every one of these monstrosities that goes to work      in the garden is not littering our roadsides or waters.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Ketcher N.Southard<br />      High Point, North Carolina</em>    </p>    <h3>Hand-Helping Handle Handler</h3>    <p>      The wooden handles on hoes and other garden tools tend to      weather after a few years, especially if the tools are      accidentally left outdoors through a rainstorm or two. And      once that weathering sets in, the once-smooth wood becomes      booby-trapped with splinters and is generally pretty hard      on gardening hands.    </p>    <p>      You can avoid blisters (or worse) by simply slipping cut      sections of old garden hose over traumatized tool handles,      providing a secure and comfortable grip. If the hose has to      be split to fit, just secure it with tape.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Fred A. Race<br />      Euclid, Ohio</em>    </p>    <h3>Trick With a Brick</h3>    <p>      Broken shards of brick can serve a useful purpose in garden      cleanup. Simply dip the chunk in water, and use it to      remove rust from spades, shovels, hoes and so forth. The      brick will remove a surprising amount of corrosion, and      whatever remains should disappear as the tool is used.    </p>    <p>      -Herbert Ducote<br />      Bunkie, Louisiana    </p>    <h3>Hose on the Faucet?</h3>    <p>      Ever wonder what to do with the little bits of leftover      soap by the sink or in the shower? We save these too-small      odds and ends until we have a handful or so, then knot them      into one leg of an old pair of pantyhose. Tied to the      outdoor faucet nearest our garden, this stuffed stocking      offers no-slip cleaning for garden-dirty hands. We're also      happy to be able to reuse items that would otherwise be      thrown away.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Sammy Reese<br />      Good Hope, Georgia</em>    </p>    <h3>A Cedar-Eater Beater</h3>    <p>      Back in the late teens and early 1920s, I watched my dad      cut cedar twigs and simmer them in a pot of water for a few      minutes, then use another branch to sprinkle the cooled      liquid over his small garden plants to repel cut worms. It      sure seemed to do the job.    </p>    <p>      Years later, when my own garden was plagued with corn      earworms, I tried the same formula on my maturing ears. The      worms (which, after all, are larval moths ... and cedar is      famous as a moth repellent) left for less aromatic      pastures.    </p>    <p>      Just pour the tea into a small plastic spray bottle, and      douse your seedlings (to prevent cutworms) or newly      appearing silks (to repel earworms). Keep spraying every      day or two until pest danger has passed. It's a      surprisingly simple and natural remedy, but it's sure      worked for me.    </p>    <p>      <em>--D. D.Smith<br />      Beebe, Arkansas</em>    </p>    <h3>Bone Up for Beetle Prevention</h3>    <p>      My spud crop has been virtually free of potato beetles for      the past 10 years, and I attribute this minor miracle to a      simple bit of pest prevention. Simply roll your moist      potato eyes (or seed spuds) in bone meal, then let them sit      overnight before planting.    </p>    <p>      Be sure, thereafter, to cut and remove any volunteer      potatoes from the prior year's crop. In my experience,      those untreated plants will be crawling with pests, while      the bone mea-ltreated potatoes will grow pest free.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Norma Cowden</em> <em><br />      Shawnee, Oklahoma</em>    </p>    <h3>Dealing With Debris</h3>    <p>      I hang an empty three-pound coffee can from the handle of      my rotary tiller while I turn the soil in my garden. Then,      as stones, pieces of wire, hunks of metal and so forth come      to the surface, I collect them and dump them in the trash.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Richard L. Haynes</em> <em><br />      Stroud, Oklahoma</em>    </p>    <h3>"Shin" Guards for Shrubs</h3>    <p>      Bushes and small trees can be damaged by the whirling nylon      line of a weed trimmer. To protect my woody plants, I cut      thin plastic drainpipe (standard four-inch-diameter is      fine) into six-inch sections. Each piece is slit all the      way down one side and placed around a stem or trunk.    </p>    <p>      <em>-Steve Bloxham</em><br />      Stokes Valley, New Zealand    </p>
