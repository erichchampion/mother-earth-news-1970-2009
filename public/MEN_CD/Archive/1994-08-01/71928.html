                <p>      <strong>Energy & Environment</strong>    </p>        <p>      Joel Burne reports on the plight of      America's once most prolific fisheries, the Columbia River,      and efforts to save its diminishing salmon.    </p>        <p>      HYDRO POWER PRICE?<br /> "We don't have a (Columbia) river      anymore. We have a series of ponds, bathtubs. We've created      an environment for fish that stresses them terribly."    </p>    <p>      Kent Martin sits in the living room of his comfortable      two-story home watching raindrops pound the sliding-glass      doors. Outside, pastures already damp with puddles drain      into a creek that meanders down the Skama Valley to the      hamlet of Skamokawa, Washington, where it empties into      Brooks Slough and the broad expanse of the Columbia River.      The river and those fields sustained Kent Martin's father,      his grandfather, his great-grandfather and thousands of      other Nordic immigrants who settled the fishing communities      on the Lower Columbia.    </p>    <p>      But they no longer sustain Kent Martin    </p>        <p>      "This is incredibly painful. It's like living in a      mausoleum," says the barrel-chested commercial fisherman      whose steel-rimmed glasses and shining pate give him an      American Gothic air. "I've seen fire departments, schools,      churches, all the institutions holding these communities      together, falling apart. Everything people said in the      1940s is coming true like a curse:"    </p>    <p>      What people said, particularly a young fisheries biologist      named Joseph A. Craig, was that the rapid industrialization      of the Pacific Northwest was having a dramatic impact on a      resource once thought as inexhaustible as the mighty river      itself. Columbia River salmon. As early as 1935, Craig      warned that logging, soil erosion, mining, pollution,      irrigation, and overfishing were taking their toll on      salmon stocks that were diminishing even then. Craig was      particularly concerned with the large hydroelectric dams      proposed for the Columbia River. He warned that dams would      flood spawning grounds, hinder juvenile fish on their way      to the sea, and, if built without adequate fish passages,      would annihilate entire runs.    </p>    <p>      "As power and irrigation projects become more numerous," he      wrote, "the protection and conservation of the migratory      fishes of the Columbia present a problem that requires the      best efforts of our engineers and biologists and the      cooperation of the state and federal agencies involved, if      this resource is to be maintained."    </p>        <p>      Since then more than 200 dams have been built in the      Texas-sized Columbia River Basin, many with faulty fish      ladders or none at all. Half of the salmons' original      spawning ground is no longer accessible to them. In      addition, farmers diverted river water to irrigate more      than eight million acres of fertile desert, while loggers      dearcut swaths through the Northwest's temperate rain      forest. The dams also succeeded where plate tectonics      failed, creating a seaport in Idaho.    </p>    <p>      REPLACING THE LOSSES?<br /> Smolts raised in hatcheries don't      seem to develop defenses they need in the wild, giving      gulls and other fish-eating birds a field day.    </p>        <p>      Not surprisingly, salmon have returned in fewer and fewer      numbers to a river that, after five million years of annual      migrations, began looking startlingly unfamiliar. An      estimated 16 million salmon were spawning in the Columbia      and its tributaries when Lewis and Clark arrived in 1802.      Only 300,000 wild salmon and steelhead return to the      Columbia basin today, and that number is dwindling. Recent      studies estimate 90 percent or more of human-inflicted      mortality comes from the dams and the reservoirs behind      them.    </p>    <p>      Last October the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS)      released a draft proposal to save four threatened or      endangered salmon runs in Idaho's Snake River, the      Columbia's major tributary. These are some of the toughest      salmon in the system, swimming 900 miles upstream to an      elevation of 6,500 feet and fording eight monolithic dams      on the Snake and Columbia rivers. The plan called for      eliminating fishermen like Kent Martin from the Lower      Columbia by 2002 and for continued study of the dam      problem.    </p>    <p>      "We have some of the best salmonid biologists in the nation      here," Martin says. "You sit down and have a cup of coffee      with them and for most there is this impotent rage that      comes over them because of what's being done to this      system. Because what's running this system is politics, not      biology."    </p>    <p>      Bob Eaton knows a thing or two about the politics of power.      As executive director of Salmon For All, he represents some      800 commercial fishermen and processors on the Lower      Columbia. An enormous chinook salmon, steely gray with      mouth agape, hangs on his office wall at the port of      Astoria, Oregon. Tankers and grain ships glide by his      office window, waiting their turn to enter Portland's ship      channel.    </p>    <p>      "To talk about the Columbia River is really inaccurate,"      says Eaton. "We don't have a river anymore. We have a      series of ponds, bathtubs. We've created an environment for      anadromous fish that stresses them terribly." Four years      ago Eaton represented commercial fishermen at the so-called      Salmon Summit, an attempt by Senator Mark Hatfield (D-OR)      to bring together industry, agriculture, and fishing      interests to forge a regional solution to the declining      runs. But instead of contributing to a constructive      discussion on saving salmon, Eaton says, the state      fisheries managers were immediately blasted by the dam      interests for not doing their jobs. This broadside was      launched despite the fact that one of the threatened runs,      the summer Chinook, has been off-limits to fishermen since      1964.    </p>    <p>      "Early on at the Salmon Summit it was evident that if you      eliminated the comme rcial and sport fisheries on these      stocks from Alaska to the Danes, you still couldn't save      those runs," says Eaton. The problem is that the protected      fish-Snake River sockeye and spring, summer, and fall      chinook-at times mingle with healthy wild stocks and      the 2.2 million hatchery fish that return to the Columbia      each year. The healthiest run of wild fish, ironically,      spawns in the Hanford Reach, a 50-mile-long stretch that      courses through the Hanford Nuclear Reservation, the site      of widespread radioactive contamination. The run is "the      guts" of the fishery, according to Eaton, for both Lower      Columbia gill-netters and the Indian tribes that fish above      Bonneville Dam and are allowed half the in-river catch by      law.    </p>    <p>      Fishermen say they only catch three to five percent of the      returning Snake River fish, while nearly half die      negotiating the fish ladders on the eight main stem dams.      Yet the runs are so depleted that each fish has become      vital to the population's survival. What angers Bob Eaton      is that eliminating the gill-netters is much easier,      cheaper, and far less politically painful than making the      dams more friendly to fish. The NMFS draft recovery plan      says that "while it may be controversial to compensate      fishermen for giving up the privilege of harvesting a      public resource, no other measure seems likely to produce      mature spawners at so little cost."    </p>    <p>      "The question is whether there is political will to do more      than maintain gene pools," says Eaton. "If your goal is to      support a commercial and sport fishery, then you've got a      resource, not a museum piece. But if the goal is to get      them back to cameo size, then there is no fixture for sport      or commercial fisheries in the Northwest."    </p>    <p>      Not far from the port of Astoria, the Columbia River      Maritime Museum displays a rich repository of artifacts      from the heyday of the fishery. Within its collection, two      black-and-white photos stand out. The first shows a      grizzled man in a wet fedora lifting an 82 1/2-pound      chinook salmon. The fish stretches from his sagging      shoulders to the tangle of net at his feet.    </p>    <p>      These were the "June Hogs," the giant royal Chinook that      formed the basis of the early fishery. In late spring and      early summer, these enormous fish began their run, climbing      the falls at Cascades and Celilo, and continuing undaunted      to the very headwaters of the river in the Arrow Lakes of      British Columbia. Yet when the final gate of the Grand      Coulee Dam closed in 1941, it sealed the June Hogs' fate.      With a height of 343 feet, the dam was considered too tall      for fish ladders. It closed off 1,000 river miles of salmon      habitat, a third of the upper Columbia. Still the      indomitable June Hogs held on, spawning in the tailwaters      below the dam until the mid-1950s, when they followed the      passenger pigeon to extinction.    </p>    <p>      "They made drastic attempts to save the species," says Hobe      Kytr, museum educator. "None were successful because they      hadn't a clue to their biology"    </p>    <p>      The other photo shows a dozen men knee-deep in water      struggling to haul in a net filled to biblical proportions.      The caption reads: "Haul Seining on Sand Island, August 22,      1921." For this method, teams of draft horses pulled nearly      half-mile-long seines onto sandbars in the rivermouth. This      particular crew caught 30 tons in one haul, 94 tons in one      day. Yet the total catch that year for all five species      (some 15.5 million pounds) was just half of the chinook      catch at the peak of the fishery in 1883.    </p>    <p>      That year 39 canneries were pumping out canned salmon on      the Columbia, 22 in Astoria alone. The canneries packed      more salmon here than anyplace else in the world and sold      their product on nearly every continent. They printed      colorful labels and devised clever brand names to appeal to      their varied markets. These included Pine Burr, Bear Brand,      Bumble Bee, Esquimaux, Bon Bon, Rosebud, even Stonewall      Jackson Brand (I suppose for the salmon that never      surrenders). At its peak, the industry and ancillary      businesses employed some 80,000 people. Even during the      heart of the depression in 1933-the year the Rock      Island Dam became the first to cross the Columbia-the      fishery generated $10 million in revenues.    </p>    <p>      Wearing white cotton gloves, Kytr retrieves a thin volume      from the museum archives and carries it toward a table as      if it were the Dead Sea Scrolls. The title is "The History      and Development of the Fisheries of the Columbia River,"      more commonly known as the Craig and Hacker Report.      Published in 1938 by Joseph Craig and Robert Hacker, two      biologists with the former U.S. Bureau of Fisheries, the      document is considered the seminal treatise on the problems      of the Columbia River salmon. Everything from fishing      pressure to dam-caused mortality is in there, says Kytr,      tapping the report with a gloved finger.    </p>    <p>      "About the salmon in Idaho, the questions being asked now      should have been considered in the 50s and 60s," Kytr says.      "All the data were available. Yet dams were put in without      fish passages or with inadequate fish passages. The      decision was made 30 years ago. They traded salmon for      irrigation and electricity."    </p>    <p>      When Bill Kirk, archaeologist, former hodad, and rabid      steelhead fisherman steps out of his 1958 New Moon house      trailer on the banks of the North Fork Nehalem River, a      certain gleam shines in his eyes. He wears green oilskins,      black rubber boots, and his blonde hair and beard are      matted from the rain. He looks as if he has been standing      in a river for a few hours, which he has. Earlier that day      he hooked and fought two nice steelhead, hence the gleam.    </p>    <p>      He pulls the two fish from a refrigerator beneath a nearby      shed and lays them on the ground. The female, known as a      hen, glistens silvery in the wet grass, about 27 inches      long. She is a "bright" fish, Kirk explains, not long from      the sea. The other fish is smaller, darker, with a pinkish      lateral band that denotes a spawning male. Usually the      darker the fish, the less desirable to most anglers, though      Kirk seems pleased. I ask how long he fought them.    </p>    <p>      "I don't really know," he replies, "When you catch a fish,      time stands still."    </p>    <p>      Both fish have been fin-clipped; the brand they receive      from the hatchery. Wild steelhead populations have dropped      so precipitously that anglers are no longer allowed to keep      them but instead must release any caught unharmed. Unlike      salmon, steelhead can survive to spawn two or three times.      But steelhead favor similar spawning grounds as chinook and      coho salmon and, like these species, have suffered      dramatically from habitat loss and degradation. Young      steelhead spend up to three years in fresh water, so they      must have streams that are cool, well oxygenated and rich      in aquatic and terrestrial insects.    </p>    <p>      Logging hits them especially hard. Early loggers built      splash dams to help transport logs downstream, scouring the      streambed in the process. Modern clearcutting also destroys      riparian vegetation and shade trees, increasing the water      temperature and decreasing available food for young fish.      The ensuing erosion often buries spawning gravel with silt.    </p>    <p>      Two small creeks enter the North Fork not 100 yards from      Kirk's home, each draining separate draws in the mountains      beyond. In 1979 loggers clear-cut the south side and for      nearly five years, Kirk says, its crystal stream ran like      coffee. When it finally began to clear, the loggers cut the      north side and the second stream began pumping silt into      the river.    </p>    <p>      Kirk wants to show me a nearby hatchery, so we hop in the      car and follow a meandering one-lane blacktop that      parallels the river. Even in the cold rain, pickups are      parked at each bridge, while their owners wade into the      dark swirling water, casting continuously. At the hatchery,      tiny coho salmon, about three inches long, swim in a series      of narrow concrete tanks. They hit the surface like      raindrops when Bill and I walk by. That behavior is part of      their problem.    </p>    <p>      In the late 1930s when the first big dams were constructed      on the Columbia, Congress passed the Mitchell Act, which      funded the building of hatcheries to compensate for lost      habitat. At that time, fishery science was still evolving,      and hatchery managers naturally concentrated on stocks that      prospered in hatcheries, if not in streams. In many rivers,      including the North Fork, managers decided to replace wild      runs with hatchery fish, stringing an electric weir across      the stream to capture native spawners. The endangered Snake      River sockeye was the target of a similar enterprise in      Idaho.    </p>    <p>      The "put-and-take" approach forms the basis of both the      commercial and sport salmon and steelhead fisheries today.      But critics say the hatchery fish not only mask the      critical declines of wild runs but actively harm them by      competing for food and space and by transmitting diseases.      Perhaps more important, they threaten to dilute the genetic      makeup of the wild fish by interbreeding.    </p>    <p>      These wild genes are the gold mine of the resource, some      advocates say, placing wild fish several steps up the      evolutionary ladder from their hatchery brethren. Wild fish      are more aggressive as a result. Percentagewise, more wild      fish survive the rigors of salmon life to spawn. Idaho, for      example, pumps 22 million smolts into the Snake River each      year, but too few return to even provide the hatcheries      with brood stock. The cost of these fish has been estimated      at more than $1,000 apiece.    </p>    <p>      Bill Kirk stands by a tank of coho smolts and tries to get      them to rise for my camera. They've done this three or four      times now, a conditioned response from hatchery workers      flinging fish chow pellets at them. They learn that when a      shadow passes overhead, food comes from above. In the      ocean, this response gives gulls, cormorants, and other      low-flying, fish-eating birds a field day.    </p>    <p>      The bottom line, Hobe Kytr says, is that hatchery fish are      dumb.    </p>    <p>      The road to Skamokawa hugs the shores of the Columbia      River, winding past islands of pilings where old canneries,      docks and fish houses stood. Gas stations or any other      signs of modern commerce are few and far between. In the      town center of Skamokawa a group of small shops and stores      seem to cling to both the water and the land. None are      open. Most look abandoned. Only a small roadhouse/truck      stop and museum dedicated to river life on the Columbia      show any signs of life.    </p>    <p>      A faded Bristol Bay sailboat rudder points the way to Kent      and Irene Martin's place, the same land that Kent's      great-grandfather, John Strom of Sweden, laid claim to in      1873. For years it has been an ideal place for them. Kent      grosses as much as $60,000 from the river in the best      years. As the runs declined he diversified, fishing the      healthier Bristol Bay salmon runs in Alaska. Last year he      grosses just over $3,000 from the Columbia River, not      enough to pay the insurance on the boat nor to make      repairs. Fiver years ago he says he could have sold his      boat, nets and license for $150,000. He doubts it would      bring a tenth of that today. If it weren't for his disabled      mother who lives nearby. Kent Martin says he wuld have left      long ago for British Columbia or Alaska.    </p>    <p>      "My rage is that the fishing industry has been the only one      that has suffered from this," Martin says. "For everyone      else it has been business as usual."    </p>    <p>      The NMFS Draft Recovery Plan, which recommended buying out      the fishermen, is particularly nettlesome. Written by a      group of scientiests known as the "Lucky Seven," plan also      called for developing "selective" gear types, such as fish      traps, which theoretically would allow fishermen to release      protected fish unharmed. Unlike hatchery steelhead,      however, hatchery salmon are not marked by fin removal.      Fishermen say one has to be ichthyologist or an Indian to      tell them apart.    </p>    <p>      Fish traps, long loathed by gill-netters, were banned from      the Columbia in 1948. Another option that the panel      considered, then rejected, was drawing down the four Snake      River reservoirs to riverbed level for six months each      spring to allow young smolts to proceed unimpeded to the      Columbia. The biologist admitted that drawing down the      river to natural levels would produce excellent survival      rates but would have a "drastic" effect on irrigation,      barge operation, and power generation, activities that for      the most part would be foregone for the period. Kent Martin      and his fellow gillnetters call it "ballot-box biology" and      call its progenitors "waterless gear experts" and      "biostitutes," among other things.    </p>    <p>      The most galling aspect of the plan to the Martins,      however, was the establishment of a five-member scientific      board to oversee the implementation of the recovery plan.      The Salmon Oversight Committee would consist of "scientific      experts" compensated at "executive" levels for a      "prestigious professional experience." The Lucky Seven did      not rescue themselves from consideration.    </p>    <p>      "This is an example of the bureaucratic and academic      ivory-tower mentality that dispatches an entire way of life      for local communities along the Columbia and then spends      five pages about job security for themselves," Kent Martin      says.    </p>    <p>      The social impacts of the declining fishery most concern      Irene Martin. An Episcopal minister and local librarian,      she has witnessed the suffering first hand. She cites the      example of a daycare center her church opened a few years      ago. They created a sliding scale to calculate the fees: 20      percent for above-average income families, 40 percent for      middle-income families, and 40 percent for below-average      income families. Last year, 94 percent of the children came      from low-income families. So many kids showed up hungry the      center started a breakfast program. Seven of the kids were      diagnosed as anemic, requiring special diets. Now she is      seeking grant money just to keep the center open.    </p>    <p>      "You're looking at severe social problems. Plain stark      poverty," Martin says, barely controlling her anger. "No      one is addressing these community needs. No one is      addressing what is happening to the children:"    </p>    <p>      A hundred miles upstream from Skamokawa, the Bonneville Dam      stretches across the river in three giant sections. It is a      National Historic Landmark, the first bulwark of the      greatest hydropower system in the world, and a graying      monument to our ability to create and to destroy. In the      bowels of the newest generating station, the floor shudders      with power. Not from the eight giant turbines painted      tangelo orange, but from 624 tons of water flowing beneath      one's feet. Enough water passes by each rotor to fill an      Olympic swimming pool in six seconds. Despite expensive      screens and bypass systems, some 80 percent of the      downstream smolt are either forced over the spillway, where      they become easy prey for sqawfish, or are sucked through      the turbines like sardines in a 40-foot Cuisinart.    </p>    <p>      Despite the seeming invincibility of these structures and      the powerful lobbies behind them, some cracks are spreading      through their facade. The aluminum industry, which uses a      third of the region's hydropower at greatly subsidized      prices, is reeling from a worldwide glut of aluminum and      increased recycling. Bonneville Power Authority, which      markets power from the dams, lost $750 million over the      last two years and may lose $800 million this year. A      Portland-based environmental group recently proposed      eliminating 11 major dams in the system along with the      subsidized aluminum industry, a plan they say will not only      save salmon but create a power surplus.    </p>    <p>      Last year Idaho and numerous environmental groups took NMFS      to court over an agency ruling that the dams posed "no      jeopardy" to the endangered fish stocks, which could lead      to court-ordered drawdowns. Meanwhile, the scientific      community has thoroughly blasted the draft recovery plan,      which is now undergoing revision and should be released for      public comment this spring.    </p>    <p>      Walking through the powerhouse, I touch the cool concrete      of the wall. Despite its colorful yellow paint, the surface      is pocked with tiny holes and imperfections and the paint      is peeled in spots as if there were a leak somewhere. It      reminds me of a comment I heard days earlier at the      Columbia River Maritime Museum. On my way out I stopped by      the museum gift shop. A young grandmotherly type was      working the register-an opportunity to gauge the      woman-on-the-street vote. I asked her what she thought      should be done to save the salmon. "Well," she replied      softly, "they say the life expectancy of concrete is only      100 years:" She allowed herself a mischievous smile.    </p>    <p>      BUREAUCRATIC STRANGLE<br /> "You're looking at a severe social      problem," Mrs. Martin says. "Plain stark poverty. No one is      addressing this community's needs."    </p>
