                <p>      <strong>Pet Health</strong>    </p>        <p>      How do you pick up a rabbit?      Andrea Looney, D.N., answers that and other householdanimal      questions.    </p>				         <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>I was servicing my truck one day and accidentally      spilled some antifreeze on the floor of the garage. My dog,      who was keeping me company, began licking the puddle.      Although I pulled him away immediately, he loitered around      that spot even after I cleaned it up. What is it about      antifreeze that attracts my dog so much?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Terry Dennis Eugene, Oregon</em>    </p>        <p>      Dear Terry:    </p>    <p>      When someone mentions the word "poison," we usually      visualize a bottle of lethal powder or fluid deliberately      given to an unsuspecting individual. Many ordinary,      seemingly innocent, household and garage items, however,      can be quite harmful, if not fatal, to pets. Antifreeze is      one of the most potent of these chemicals. It has a sweet      taste that attracts many animals and explains your dog's      fascination. Upon ingestion, the substance is quickly      absorbed and metabolized to form certain acids. These acids      then combine with calcium to cause crystals that lodge in      the kidney tubules. Animals that become toxic from      ingesting antifreeze succumb to renal (kidney) failure from      crystallization of this important organ.    </p>    <p>      Less-toxic antifreezes (such as one marketed by Safe Brands      Corporation of Omaha, Nebraska) are now available. To be      sure that your pet doesn't ingest any antifreeze (as well      as to avoid poisoning the underground water supply), don't      drain it onto the ground or driveway; instead drain it into      a covered container or sand receptacle and dispense      properly. Watch for leaky radiators or hoses; they may drip      small amounts of antifreeze for days before the problem is      discovered. Should your cat or dog walk through such a      puddle, try to wipe their feet off before they lick them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>My 6-year-old semi-long-haired cat can't seem to      eat any food without getting sick to his stomach. What can      I do?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-K Smith Cantor, Ohio</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear K:    </p>        <p>      Cats vomit for a variety of reasons. The most common      reasons include parasites and hairballs. Parasites may be      treated with appropriate anthelmintics or de-wormers, best      obtained from your veterinarian and specific for the type      of worm the animal has.    </p>    <p>      Hairballs are especially prevalent in long-haired cats. As      the cat cleans itself, the loose, shed hairs are often      swallowed. In the stomach, they may form a mass, often      incapable of passing into the intestines. If the mass does      pass, it may cause obstruction of the intestines or      constipation.    </p>    <p>      There are special preparations, usually with a mineral oil      or petroleum base, that may simply allow passage of the      hair down the GI tract. Vaseline may also be helpful in      very small amounts but rarely does the trick on its own.      You may also try fresh pineapple juice or papain tablets      (from the local health food store), both of which will      digest the hairs instead of promoting their passage. The      best treatment of hairballs is once again, prevention. I      would suggest frequent brushing of the animal, possibly      once or twice a day to remove those broken and shed hairs      before they are groomed and swallowed.    </p>    <p>      Also, try switching the diet to a bland cat food (which      doesn't necessarily mean a poorer quality food!). For      instance, the semimoist foods or simple boiled chicken and      cooked white rice for a few days may help calm the      gastrointestinal system. Feed s mall amounts 4-5 times per      day instead of one lump sum. Make any dietary changes      gradual, or over a few meals. See your veterinarian if      things continue because there are many other more serious      problems (infections, thyroid disease, liver, or kidney      disease) that can also cause vomiting.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>Our 12-year-old Gordon setter was recently dialed      with renal failure. How long will he five and what does      this mean?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Carol Newell</em> <em>Helena, Montana</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Carol:    </p>    <p>      Kidneys filter and remove from the blood- stream waste      materials acquired from the body's metabolism. Kidney      disease refers to any destructive process within the      kidney. Kidney failure is the end result of kidney disease.      Failure may have many different causes, including inherited      defects, infections, ingestion of toxic substances, and      nutritional factors. It is one of the most common medical      problems in geriatric dogs and cats and often occurs      secondary to heart failure and hypertension. In kidney      (renal) failure, the kidney fails to filter blood      adequately, so some of the waste materials remain in the      blood and become toxic to cells.    </p>    <p>      If it is detected early on, a change in diet may be all      that is required to treat kidney disease. Kidney failure,      however, may make it necessary for an ill pet to be      hospitalized for proper fluid therapy and medications.      Dietary management is an important part of therapy. By      feeding your pet a well-balanced diet with reduced amounts      of phosphorus and sodium and including high- quality      protein, the quantity of waste materials filtered by the      diseased kidneys is also reduced. Frequently, supplementing      with a multiple vitamin (one a day) may be beneficial. You      may slow the progression of chronic renal failure by      providing such sound nutrition and free access to plenty of      clean, fresh water and protecting your pet from stress,      such as excitement, extreme exertion, or hot and cold      temperature extremes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>    </p>    <p>      <strong>We just purchased a rabbit for our son. I realize      Hurt there are certain ways to hold the animal and pick him      up. What's the best way?</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-Marlene Cohen</em> <em>Spokane, Washington</em>    </p>    <p>      Dear Marlene:    </p>    <p>      Rabbits have very powerful hind limbs, and are capable of      delivering very strong kicks, so strong, in fact, that they      may easily dislocate or fracture their vertebrae (break      their back). The key, therefore, in handling a bunny, is to      calmly gain control of their hind end first and foremost.      Grasp the skin above the shoulders (scruff) with one hand      and support the hind end under the rump with the other.      Some folks carry the rabbit like a football with the head      at the handler's elbow and the rump in the palm of the      hand.    </p>    <p>      Never pick a rabbit up by its ears! Contrary to popular      opinion, these are not handles, and this may easily injure      the animal. If the rabbit begins to struggle when initially      picked up or restrained, it should be released. Attempt      restraint when it calms down.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dear Andrea: What causes allergies in dogs? Our      Labrador retriever sneezes all the time.</strong>    </p>    <p>      <em>-David Wescott Provo, Utah</em>    </p>        <p>      Dear David:    </p>    <p>      Just like us, dogs suffer from allergies. However, where      human allergy symptoms normally include sneezing, wheezing,      runny nose, and watery eyes, a dog's allergy symptoms      differ. Although canine allergies are not life threatening,      the itching that they cause can make your dog miserable.    </p>    <p>      An allergy is a disease that is a result of the immune      system reacting abnormally to a substance, such as pollen,      mold, house dust, insect bites (fleas), food, or certain      chemicals. Inhaling, eating, or simple contact with these      substances can cause a reaction in an allergic animal. The      most commonly seen allergies in dogs are to fleas, foods,      and inhaled substances. These types of allergies are almost      always manifested by itchiness and scratching, not      sneezing. This scratching is more intense than normal, and      can result in rashes, hair loss, and secondary infections.    </p>    <p>      There are many drugs that can be given to treat allergies      including antihistamines, steroids, and topicals. The best      and most obvious treatment is avoidance of the aller gens,      such as limiting intake of certain foods and stringent flea      control. While it is impossible to avoid airborne allergens      like pollens and weeds, desensitizing your pet to offending      substances through immunotherapy can control much of the      itching aggravation.    </p>		<p><strong>Dear Andrea:</strong>		</p>    <p>      <strong>What is the normal length for claws in dogs? Our      shepherd can deliver a bad scratch, even when just playing      with us, but we worry about trimming him. What happens if      they're trimmed too short?</strong>    </p>    <p>      Andrew Konig<br />Deerfield, Massachusetts    </p>    <p>      Dear Andrew:    </p>    <p>      A dog's nail length should be checked periodically,      possibly even once a month. Some dogs, especially those      that don't go outside much, fail to wear down their nails      naturally. Some can grow so long that they spiral back on      themselves or stick into a pad. Such a condition is not      only extremely painful but can produce permanent damage if      not soon taken care of.    </p>    <p>      The normal, well groomed nail is about even with the bottom      pads of the foot, so that when the dog walks, the nails      barely brush the ground. When they begin to develop a hook      or become longer than the arc of a 90° angle (1/4 of a      circle), then they are too long. A nail trimmer is an      inexpensive purchase. Don't use ordinary scissors as they      will crack the nail. In the beginning, take only a little      off at a time from each nail. Trim carefully, but try to      cut quickly to avoid a crushing action with the blade.    </p>    <p>      There are blood vessels within the nail itself that are      easily seen in clear nails, but invisible in pigmented      nails. If a nail is clipped too short, it will bleed.      Should this occur, you can dab it with a styptic pencil,      apply a poultice of corn starch and water, press the nail      into a bar of soap, or apply pressure with a cloth for a      few moments to stop the bleeding.    </p>    <p>      DON'T LET THE TASTE FOOL THEM!<br /> The flavor of antifreeze can      be appealing to animals, but it is a lethal poison.    </p>
