            		      <h5 id="byline">By Eliot Coleman</h5>      <p>Enjoy a weed-free garden by using these four simple      techniques and two special hoes.    </p>        <p>      Weeds probably discourage more potential gardeners than any      other single problem. "Oh, the garden was overgrown with      weeds and we finally gave up" is a common explanation of      many frustrated gardeners, but it doesn't need to be that      way. Have you ever heard anyone say, "Oh, the living room      finally got so dusty that we just stopped using it"? We      don't stop enjoying the living room because of dust. We      simply vacuum or sweep every so often to keep the room      clean. It's the same for your garden: Regularly cleaning      your garden by weeding is one of the keys to keeping your      crops productive and your enthusiasm strong. Here are the      top weed-prevention strategies, plus the two best weeding      hoes.    </p>    <p>      <strong>First, don't dig the garden.</strong> Plowing or      deep tilling buries weed seeds, then brings them back up.      Let buried seeds stay buried. Most weed seeds germinate      only in the top two inches of soil.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Don't let weeds go to seed.</strong> Nature is      prolific. Each plant can produce an enormous number of      seeds. The old saying "One year's seeding means seven      years' weeding" holds. The results of this carelessness are      cumulative: The more seeds you have, the more weeds you      have. But the results of care also are cumulative: If weed      plants are removed from the garden and placed in the      compost heap <em>before</em> they go to, seed, their      thousands of seeds won't be added to the garden. No seeds,      no weeds. And, as the years progress, fewer and fewer seeds      will be left in the garden to germinate.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Till twice before you sow.</strong> Before you      plant a new garden, till the soil shallowly to encourage      weed seeds to sprout, then water the area if the soil is      dry. The combination of air, moisture and exposure to light      will stimulate weed-seed germination. Wait a week after      tilling and then hoe or till again to eradicate all the      newly germinated weed seedlings before you plant. The more      times you repeat this pre-plant weed-reduction technique,      the fewer dormant weed seeds you will have lurking in your      garden beds. Once the upper-layer weed seeds are exhausted      (it takes a number of years, so be patient), very few new      weeds will appear unless you bring them up from below or      let weeds mature and drop new seeds.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Dispatch weeds while they are small.</strong> Tiny,      newly germinated weeds are the easiest to kill. A sharp hoe      drawn shallowly through the soil between the crop rows will      quickly dispatch small weeds. Cultivating is the gentle      stirring of the soil's surface to uproot newly germinated      weeds before they become a problem. That minimum effort      yields a maximum benefit, curing the weed problem, while      making a tidy garden. And a well-kept garden may motivate      you to spend more caretaking time there.    </p>		<h3>      THE PERFECT HOE    </h3>        <p>      For cultivating, an effective hoe is sharp; angled for      drawing, not chopping; slim, so as not to bulldoze soil      onto the vegetable plants; and accurate, so as to pass      between the crop rows without damage. It also must be      comfortable and fun to use, or you will find some other way      to spend your time. Years ago I could never find such a      hoe, so I made my own. Today you can buy this tool, which I      call the collineal (which means "in the same straight      line") hoe. Various interpretations of this design are sold      by a number of garden tool catalogs (see "Special Offer,"      Page 45). It is designed for skimming in soft, fertile soil      rather than for chopping compacted earth.    </p>    <p>      For my collineal hoe, I wanted an efficiently designed      tool, not a crude blud geon. I also wanted a hoe I could      use standing upright, to minimize back strain. Since that      meant I would be holding it with my thumbs up the handle,      as with a broom or leaf rake, I had to find the ideal angle      between the blade and the handle for a shallow, skimming      action. Seventy degrees turned out to be ideal. I made the      blade as thin and narrow as possible so that it would cut      and skim without gouging and bulldozing. Because the blade      was narrow, the cutting edge could line up with the      centerline of the hoe handle, ensuring an accurate aim in      cutting weeds rather than crops. Finally, I sharpened the      blade like a razor, so the cutting edge would be right next      to the soil. A sharp hoe allows you to work shallowly and      not disturb the roots of the crop plants.    </p>    <p>      Using this collineal hoe with the proper angle and a thin,      sharp blade is like dancing with a skilled partner, and      just as enjoyable. Hold it in a ballroom-dancing position,      with your thumbs upward. Stand comfortably with your back      straight. The hoe blade draws effortlessly through the soil      of the growing areas. Hoe when weeds are very small, gently      cultivating the soil's surface. Go out to the garden on a      summer's evening, put a Strauss waltz on the stereo and      dance with your hoe. Weed control has never been so      civilized.    </p>    <h3>      THE BEST HOE FOR PATHS    </h3>    <p>      The only compaction in your garden should be in the paths.      For those areas, a stirrup hoe, with its thin double-edged      stirrup blade, will make your life easier. The stirrup is      hinged where it attaches to the handle so it swings back      and forth slightly, and the hinged action changes the angle      of the blade to the soil so that it cuts smoothly, whether      you are pushing or pulling. This hoe is held with the      thumbs pointing down the handle so that a lot of power can      be applied. It can cut effectively just below the soil's      surface or go deeper if you wish. The cutting blade fits      nicely in the paths between the beds where your feet have      passed. We use this hoe while moving down the paths      backward, working the hinged action of the hoe back and      forth in the compacted soil. It neatly cuts off all weeds      and leaves a fresh, aerated surface.    </p>    <p>      If you use the collineal and stirrup hoes just a few      minutes each time you visit your garden, you'll easily      solve gardening's greatest challenge and keep your crops      weed-free and your garden a place you'll enjoy.    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
