                      <h5 id="byline">By John Stuart    </h5>        <p>      In my early years working for a volunteer fire department,      the mission could not have been more clear: Control the      chaos, save the house, put the fire out!    </p>    <p>      During the same years, I worked on controlled burns on      commercial forests, where we operated under an entirely      different understanding. Here, fire was fulfilling its      beneficial, primeval mission. Low flames crackled across      the hillsides, reducing to ash the incendiary branches and      needles that could have fueled large destructive fires some      time in the future. After the burns, the enriched soil      provided a fertile bed for new tree seedlings. Valuable      nutrients in the ash were absorbed quickly by the emerging      vegetation.    </p>    <p>      Decades of research (and a certain amount of common sense)      show that fire is not only beneficial in many natural      settings, but that it is necessary to sustain the life      cycles of many living things.    </p>    <p>      Fire is inevitable in many forest and grassland habitats.      It is an eloquent promoter of diversity. Walk through a      burned area in the years following a fire and watch the      amazing parade of emerging life. Mushrooms sprout;      fruit-bearing shrubs-roses, vacciniums (blueberries,      huckleberries) and the Rubus genus (raspberries,      blackberries)-can cover hundreds of acres within five      years after a fire. The animals follow. Brushy plants and      grasses that sprout after a fire are <em>haute cuisine</em>      for the big herbivores: moose, elk and deer.    </p>    <p>      Last summer, the Biscuit Fire burned a national forest in      Oregon. Although the perimeter encompassed 500,000 acres,      about half of these acres burned lightly or not at all.      Much of the media covered the event as a tragedy for the      natural environment. In fact it was just the kind of fire      that promotes healthy plant and animal life.    </p>    <p>      Greg Clevenger, a local staff officer for the Rogue River      and Siskiyou National Forests, points out that fire "goes      in and cleans out a lot of fuel buildup. What people tend      to forget is, it will grow back. I'm not saying all fires      are good all the time. But we tend as a society to      sensationalize and overdramatize the effect.    </p>    <p>      "Fire is a natural process. It plays a role like the wind      and the rain."    </p>           <h3>      FIRE AS FOE?    </h3>    <p>      After a series of very destructive fires in the Great Lakes      region in the late 1800s and several large fires in the      early 1900s, the U.S. Forest Service established a policy      to stop all fires in national forests. Fires on private      land already were being doused, but this was the first time      largescale fire prevention was attempted on sprawling      public lands. Early 20th-century foresters, focusing on the      monetary value of trees, viewed all fires as detrimental.      Sawmill owners and logging companies did not want their      commodities going up in smoke. And national forest      decision-makers, who were being trained in the same      tradition as private foresters, worked under the same      assumptions. Our appreciation for the ecological benefits      of fire would be decades in coming.    </p>    <p>      Before forest managers got involved, frequent,      low-intensity fires burned off the brush and small trees      (the most flammable stuff) in many ecological environments.      The bigger trees survived, and benefited from the regular      deposits of nutrient-rich ash. Large trees, widely spaced      on the ground, with limbs high in the air, are fairly      fire-resistant.    </p>    <p>      Logging of these big trees has resulted in crowded stands      of young trees, much more vulnerable to fire.    </p>    <p>      As the science of ecology revealed the benefits of fire in      many forests, forest management practices changed. In the      1990s, logging levels were decreased, wide protective      buffers were established along streams and a general      feeling emerged that national forest policy was beginning      to value preservation over extraction. Unfortunately, that      feeling didn't last.    </p>    <p>      Again today, we face powerful forces that view our national      forests as commodities. In late August 2002, President Bush      made a strategically timed appearance near the Biscuit Fire      in Oregon to promote the National Fire Plan (NFP) and a new      program, the Healthy Forests Initiative (HFI). Both the NFP      and HFI attempt to increase logging in national forests,      using fire as a scare story to promote new plans that will      have little to do with fire but that will increase logging      dramatically.    </p>    <p>      Despite the stir raised by the media about the      "catastrophe" or "disaster" of wildfires, the 6 to 8      million acres per year burned in several recent years are      not extraordinary; between 1919 and 1949, an average of 29      million acres per year burned on all lands, public and      private.    </p>    <p>      The Northwest Forest Plan was designed specifically to      protect rare species and their old-growth habitat in the      Cascade forests of Washington, Oregon and northern      California. The reporting requirements of the Northwest      Forest Plan that the HFI criticizes as holding up timber      sales were put in place specifically to ensure that things      like wildlife habitat, recreation and water quality are      considered when logging plans are drafted. The Endangered      Species Act, the National Environmental Policy Act and      others that govern the preparation of timber sales were      enacted by citizens who value conservation of our national      forests. The comment and appeal regulations that HFI      criticizes have given the American people some real control      over what happens on public lands.    </p>    <p>      The national forests, in fact, are the largest reservoirs      of wildlife habitat in this country. Sometimes people need      to visit the woods, too, to experience a little of the      wilderness-and wildness-themselves.    </p>    <p>      Increasing development of rural lands surrounding the      national forests is steadily reducing their complexity and      wildness. Fire is just one of many natural elements,      sometimes peaceful, sometimes threatening, that make      forests work.    </p>    <p>      Those in favor of more logging are wordsmithing fire into      the latest "catastrophic" force to justify more      tree-cutting. Hopefully, the American people will think      otherwise.    </p>    <p>      Related Article:<br />      Firesafe Your House    </p><hr />    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>

Shown above is the startling result of the ""thinning"" program the U.S. Forest Service is proposing for more than 30 million acres of national forestlands in the West. This ""thinning"" was done in Coconino National Forest, outside of Flagstaff, Arizona.
