                <p>      THE SHUTTLEBUG - with driver and passenger - makes a test      run (right down the street with the big fellows) in      Detroit.<br />    </p>        <h5 id="byline">      by THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted)    </h5>        <p>      For new readers of this publication, the SHUTTLEBUG is a      two-place, ultra-light (860 pounds) urban vehicle. The      little car is designed (if the computer can be believed) to      deliver a maximum of 54 miles per gallon of regular      gasoline when driven at a steady 55 miles per hour. It's      also an attempt at making a very small automobile as safe      as possible (the car has a heavy roll bar over the cabin, 2      X 4 inch steel box beams along the sides of the      driver/passenger compartment, and a front end calculated to      progressively collapse-thereby safely dissipating as      much energy as possible-in a head-on collision).    </p>        <p>      Currently, the original SHUTTLEBUG prototype is being      tested with a 16-hp Tecumseh industrial engine for a power      plant and a special torque converter-equipped with a      reverse gear of our own design-in the driveline.      Although this combination does produce acceptable      off-the-line acceleration and all the "no shift"      characteristics of an automatic transmission, we're not at      all happy with the noise and vibration produced by the      power package/drive train combination. We expect to try      another engine in the car very soon.    </p>    <p>      We're also changing the design of the cabin to "build in"      more footroom without altering the vehicle's body shell in      any way. And we've got some ideas for further simplifying      the construction of that already-simple body.    </p>    <p>      Which is to say that the SHUTTLEBUG development program is      proceeding about the way such programs usually proceed: We      expect to completely rebuild the car approximately three      more times before all the bugs are ironed out and we have      everything just the way we want it.    </p>    <p>      General reports on this work will continue to appear in THE      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) from time to time. Really detailed      information about the progress (or lack of it) made on the      BUG, however, would take up far too much of this magazine's      space. For that reason up-to-the-minute test reports,      photographs of the car as it is progressively refined,      announcements of manufacturing dates, performance figures,      vehicle specifications, delivery schedules, etc., will be      published in a newsletter devoted exclusively to the little      car.    </p>    <p>      If you'd like a charter subscription to this      newsletter-plus a special information packet about      the automobile-send $6.00 and your name and address      to Shuttlebug Engineering, P.O. Box A, East Flat Rock,      North Carolina 28726. Your support will help make the      SHUTTLEBUG a reality!    </p>
