        <p>Just a note in reference to the February 2000 Country Lore article on shoemaking. If you're in a small town or lucky enough to have a saddle maker or a saddle repair shop in your city, you can go in and ask to pick through their scrap boxes. Most of the time you can get large enough pieces of leather to easily make shoes with. It is usually sold by the pound and [prices] vary from place to place. I just picked up a large plastic shopping bag full. I'm making patchwork quilt seat covers for my kitchen chairs, and for $12 I got enough material to cover at least six of them!</p><p><em>Nanc- Randleas<br />Hot Springs, SD</em></p>
