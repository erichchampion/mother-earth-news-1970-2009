        <p>A close friend told me the story of when she was a young girl of five or six and went from her farm home for a visit to her aunt in the big city of Omaha, Nebraska. Much to her alarm, when she got ready to go to bed that first night, she found that her mother had not packed her nightgown.</p><p>Her Aunt Althea, being a practical woman, was quick to remedy the situation. She hurried to her linen closet and selected a soft, well-worn cotton pillowcase. In a flash, she had cut out two armholes and a neck opening. An instant nightgown was produced for the little girl, who, my friend said, slept quite comfortably and warmly in it.</p><p><em>Arthur R. Lee<br /></em>Â <em>Santa Cruz, CA</em></p>
