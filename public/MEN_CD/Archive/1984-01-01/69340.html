                    <h5 id="byline">      by Caroline Wareham    </h5>    <p>      While constructing their house, this ingenious couple found      a way to expand the living space in their camper and      recruited the sun to help heat it . . . all for less than      $1, 000!    </p>        <p>      Like a lot of folks who set out to build their own homes,      my partner and I decided to park a mobile trailer on our      property (a remote site in northern New Mexico) and use it      for shelter until our permanent abode was completed. The      advantages of using such a ready-made dwelling are many      ("instant" plumbing, a built-in kitchen, a watertight roof,      and the like) . . . but so, unfortunately, are the      disadvantages. Not the least of these is a form of domestic      claustrophobia with the main symptom best characterized as      "If I'm stuck in this box another week, I'll go      crazy!"<br />      <br />      Some people, in fact, succumb to "trailer twitch" by      prematurely moving into their still-under-construction      homes or (what's even worse) by taking shortcuts to finish      their houses quickly. I'm happy to report, though, that      there's a much better solution to the problem . . . one      that has allowed us to live in relatively roomy (and      inexpensive) comfort while building our home exactly as we      want it at a sensible pace. The secret? An insulated,      sun-catching, heat-retaining "solar envelope" built around      our trailer!<br />      <br />      Actually, the structure is little more than a frame shed      that has its south-facing wall glazed with plastic film to      admit sunlight. It can't really compare with the much more      costly and complex double-envelope solar homes that are      designed for permanent residency. This design (the      brainchild of architect John P. Friedman of Los Lunas, New      Mexico) is intended specifically for low-cost, temporary      quarters. Consequently, it's ideal for owner-builders in      our situation . . . or for hunters or vacationers who      simply want a bit more elbowroom (and warmth) while living      in their trailers. One of the design's strongest assets, in      fact, is that an end can be built to be removable-or      even to swing open like a giant double door-so that      you can drive or tow your camper out with ease. In our      case, however, we knew that the only occasion we'd have to      open the wall would be when it came time to return our      rented unit to its owners, so we erected a more or less      "standard" end panel. Once the camper's gone, we'll simply      reattach the partition and use the envelope as a garage, a      studio, or a woodworking shop.<br />      <br />      <strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong><br />      <br />      With our 8' X 24' trailer parked on level ground and      situated so that the long side-the one with a      door-faced due south, we dug a rectangular 16' X 26'      trench, about 9" deep, around the camper . . . and filled      the moat with 3" of pea gravel. If you live in a cold      region where frost heaving is a problem, you might want to      dig a deeper trench and use more gravel (or, for a      permanent foundation, you could pour a cement footing). On      top of the fill we put up four stud walls, with the      south-facing partition measuring 8' high and the northerly      one 10'. We framed in areas for windows, too, on the east      and west panels . . . and built a small access hatch on the      east side near the trailer's hitch, so that we could easily      use that otherwise wasted space for storage.<br />      <br />      Next, we put up the roof, installing 2 X 6 rafters with a      south-to-north pitch of 1 foot for every 8 feet. Then we      stapled fiberglass insulation to the east, west, and north      walls . . . and nailed tar paper to the outside of the      three walls, using furring strips wherever necessary to      cover seams and to help anchor the material. Because we      didn't intend to install true siding, we also put a board      diagonally across each tar-papered wall to serve as a      brace.<br />      <br />      When we'd done all that, we proceeded to nail corrugated      metal roofing to the ceiling beams, insulate the roof, and      cover the south wall (minus a full-sized doorway space)      with a seamless layer of 6-mil plastic glazing. After that,      all we had to do was to tack up glazing over the two      windows and install a door. The trailer was then completely      enclosed and "in the dry".    </p>    <p>      <strong>AMENITIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      At that point, we'd finished the outside work . . .      "elevating" our abode's external appearance from that of a      trailer to what looked like a tar-paper shack! The inside      of our addition was still bare, though, so we set out to      give it the final touches that would make it part of a      <em>home.</em><br />      <br />      For starters, we installed rough-cut 1 X 10 flooring in the      sunspace, attaching the planks to 2 X 4 joists and leaving      an open space in the center of the floor for our Franklin      woodstove. We lined that area with pea gravel, placed the      heater on top of the rock, and ran an insulated metal      chimney from the fixture through the roof (care fully      following the flue manufacturer's instructions for safe      installation).<br />      <br />      Then we built a bed platform-just a bit wider than      the double mattress we put on it-against the west      wall, and tacked some paneling over the studs at the head      of the bed to give us enough "real" wall for hanging      pictures and the like (eventually, we may panel all the      partitions). Finally, we added a chair and workbench, some      throw rugs, a hanging planter, and a few other items . . .      and stood back to admire our cozy new living room.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HEAT, HOT WATER, AND ELECTRICITY, TOO!</strong>    </p>    <p>      Our envelope trailer home is exceptionally easy to keep      warm. The living space and the camper soak up Btu from the      sun, and additional thermal mass (a water-filled metal      stock tank set beneath the trailer plus concrete adobe      blocks stacked between the woodstove and the camper) stores      the heat gained. Consequently, we stay comfortable      throughout the cold winter nights with only an occasional      boost from our heater . . . while our neighbors burn cord      after cord of firewood.<br />      <br />      Ventilation is excellent: Warm air from the south wall and      the woodstove rises over the trailer, and the cooled air      flows back underneath to be heated again. In the summer, we      open two vents cut into the top of the north wall to keep      the sunspace from becoming overly hot, and the windows on      the east and west provide cross breezes.<br />      <br />      We pump water into our trailer's 20-gallon tank from a      nearby spring, and also store an emergency supply of it in      containers under the vehicle. We have plenty of hot water,      too, since the trailer's equipped with a propane heater. In      fact, once the liquid inside the tank is up to temperature,      it stays warm (thanks mostly to the envelope) for several      days, with just the pilot burning.<br />      <br />      Moreover, since we're two miles from the nearest power      line-and getting hooked up to it would cost us a      staggering $6,000!-we've installed four photovoltaic      panels on the roof. The units provide approximately 800      watt-hours of 12-volt DC electricity each day the sun      shines, and we store the energy in two 6-volt golf-cart      batteries. The system gives us enough juice for lights in      the trailer and sunspace when they're needed . . . and      provides current to run our water pump at night, as well as      in the day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>IT'S NO MANSION, BUT . . .</strong>    </p>    <p>      I can't say that we're living in the lap of luxury here in      our little solar home, but it sure beats the usual      cold-in-the-winter, cramped-the-year-round trailer life!      Altogether, our heat-grabbing envelope cost somewhere      between $600 and $800 (not including, of course, the      photovoltaic setup) . . . and we always have the option of      dismantling the structure to use the materials for some      other project.<br />      <br />      Meanwhile, we can spend our time building our permanent      house <em>correctly</em> . And, instead of being constantly      boxed up against the elements, we're enjoying the natural      beauty around us.    </p>
