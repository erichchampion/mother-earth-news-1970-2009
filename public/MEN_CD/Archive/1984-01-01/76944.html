        <p><em>In the interest of promoting one of humankind's better ideas-barter-we announced in issue 37 our still standing offer: Send us a short account of an actual barter (write to Successful Swaps, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) 105 Stoney Mountain Road, .Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791), and if we print it in this column, you'll receive a one year subscription (new or extended) to MOTHER.</em><br /><br /><em>Likewise, if you now operate, or have ever operated, a successful home business that was inspired by an article you read in MOTHER, tell us about it in approximately 500 words (write to Bootstrap Businesses, THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) ", 105 Stoney Mountain Road, Hendersonville, North Carolina 28791). Be sure to mention how you started your bootstrap business-including how much seed money you needed-the amount you make (net), and anything else that might be of assistance to other entrepreneurs. If your story is used in this column, you'll receive a free two-year subscription to MOTHER.</em><br /><br />About a year ago, my husband was laid off from an unfulfilling and frustrating job as a cook in a local restaurant. Since the only income we had then was an occasional meager paycheck from my part-time secretarial work, he frantically went from door to door, looking for odd jobs. It was a pretty hard time for the two of us . . . and it took a lot of effort to keep up with our bills. But, like many other folks in these depressed economic times, we kept our chins up and went on plugging away.<br /><br />After a couple of months of doing everything from painting doghouses to sweeping sidewalks, my husband used his truck to move a friend's parents to a new home. They couldn't afford to pay him cash, so he agreed to swap his work for an old wooden fishing boat. I must admit that I was rather perturbed when he arrived home with the well-worn craft. I'd expected some much-needed money for his day's labor, but all he had to show for it was a boat that we could use only if we drove 20 miles to the nearest fishing hole!<br /><br />Well, my husband placed an ad in the paper, offering to trade the vessel for anything of similar value. A call from an avid young fisherman precipitated a swap of the boat for a lawn mower . . . something my mate had been wanting for a long time so he could start his own grass-mowing business.<br /><br />Now, nine months later, he has done so well trimming lawns around the area that he works at it practically full-time, exchanging his services for just about anything our neighbors have to offer, from food to automobile parts . . . and even cash! In short, he's bartered his way from unemployment to a satisfying and enjoyable occupation.<br /><br />W.A.<br />Oregon<br /><br />As an impecunious artist, I've had many opportunities to find creative ways to obtain needed or desired goods or services by barter. My past trades have ranged from swapping weight-lifting lessons for haircuts to exchanging used furniture for the use of a pickup truck.<br /><br />My most successful trade to date, though, fulfilled a long-time dream. I've always been interested in the martial arts but never had the extra cash to take lessons. And trying to teach myself with the help of books, magazines, and movies just wasn't satisfactory.<br /><br />Then one day I drove by a neighborhood karate studio that had plain white Masonite panels covering the windows. It seemed to me that a window mural would attract students and make the facade more appealing, so I contacted the master and offered to paint a mural in his front window in exchange for lessons.<br /><br />Since the owner had been thinking along these lines himself, he was enthusiastic about my suggestion, and we made a deal when I produced a drawing he liked. Now, he has an attractive window, which has helped build up business, and I have eight months of free lessons to my credit.<br /><br />C.A.M.<br />Pennsylvania<br /><br />I never could find time to do my ironing (primarily because it was a chore I disliked), and had been paying a friend to do it for me.<br /><br />Then one day when I mentioned that I was crocheting an afghan, my friend asked to see the coverlet when it was completed. She really liked my handiwork, and-after a little discussion-we decided to trade: my afghan for 120 ironed shirts!<br /><br />J. S.<br />Oklahoma<br /><br />The trim on my house needed painting, but-since I'm 71 and in poor health-I was unable to get a job to earn the extra money to have it done.<br /><br />However, my problem was solved when a couple of young fellows I knew told me of their desire to start a business doing painting, carpentry, and snow shoveling from roofs. They couldn't afford a phone, so I let them use <em>my</em> number and took messages for them (this was something I could do). In exchange, they agreed to paint my trim . . . furnishing labor, paint, and ladder.<br /><br />Their business has prospered (now they have their own phone), and I have freshly painted house trim.<br /><br />Mrs. K.L.W.<br />New York<br /><br />Finding ways to earn money seems to be especially difficult in small towns and rural areas, but with the help of Larry Ketchum's article, "How to Make Money from the News" (issue 18, page 68), I've found a venture that actually works <em>best</em> in lesser-populated locales.<br /><br />Relying on the experience I gained working as a volunteer in the newsroom of a local nonprofit radio station, I landed a job as a "stringer" (a part-time reporter who works on assignment and is usually paid on a per job basis) covering events in and around my small town for a station in a city about 15 miles away.<br /><br />You see, while most radio stations broadcast over fairly large areas, their news staffs are severely limited, so-instead of sending a full-time reporter to chase stories around the entire coverage region-the news directors rely heavily on part-time help to cover local happenings throughout the stations' listening zones. I regularly cover city council meetings, public hearings, and other matters of concern to the community.<br /><br />The only mandatory expenses of the job are notebooks and writing implements. I can walk to most of the places I need to get to in town, and can call my stories in-collect-to the radio station from any pay phone. I'm paid $20 for meetings and local election coverage, and make $10 per story for coverage of other events . . . and almost all of that is profit.<br /><br />M.V.<br />Colorado<br /><br />For several years we'd had an active interest in raising hardy nut trees, but it wasn't until we read about one man's devotion to restoring the American chestnut (see "Save the Chestnuts!" by Jack Reeder on page 122 of MOTHER NO. 71) that we considered turning what had been a hobby into a moneymaking enterprise.<br /><br />Our first step was to contact several nurseries that sold nut trees. We discovered that young grafted saplings were expensive and in short supply . . . primarily because grafting trees is difficult and the specimens propagated in this manner require a year or two more nursery care than do trees raised from seed. Next, we contacted the appropriate state agencies to inquire about inspection and licensing requirements, which we found were no more rigorous than for other crops.<br /><br />The following spring, armed with the information, we invested about $100 in seed for pecan, butternut, chestnut, and filbert trees. This, combined with some carpathian and a large number of black walnut seedlings that we already had growing, gave us the beginnings of our first nursery crop. When fall arrived, we bought another $150 worth of seed in order to build and maintain our supply of trees.<br /><br />The next year we began grafting carpathian and black walnut varieties onto black walnut rootstocks. After that good growing season, we were ready to open for business. We purchased our nursery license ($10), had some price lists printed ($30), and placed several advertisements in regional gardening papers. Response to our ads brought in $850 . . . and the busy spring ordering season was still a full four months away!<br /><br />Because of the response, we're hoping we'll eventually be able to devote a much larger portion of our time to our nursery venture, and that this enterprise can help our farm become truly self-supporting.<br /><br />J.M.<br />Indiana</p>
