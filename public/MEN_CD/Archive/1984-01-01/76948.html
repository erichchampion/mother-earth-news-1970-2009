                    <p>      <strong>UTILITIES ARE CHARGING CUSTOMERS BILLIONS OF      DOLLARS FOR FEDERAL INCOME TAXES THAT ARE NEVER      PAID</strong> , according to a study released by the      Environmental Action Foundation (EAF). A law written by      utility lobbyists and adopted by Congress in 1969 allows an      electric company to charge its customers as if it didn't      receive tax breaks. But the fact is, combined federal tax      subsidies for utilities now total $5 billion to $10 billion      a year. The Power Line , EAF's monthly publication (Dept.      TMEN, 724 Dupont Circle Building, Washington, D.C. 20036 .      . . annual subscription, $25), printed some interesting      figures from the survey in a recent issue: In 1981, the      nation's top 100 electric companies billed ratepayers for      $5 billion in federal income taxes, but reported paying      only $1.3 billion to the IRS . . . Commonwealth Edison, for      example, charged its customers for an incredible $208      million in federal income taxes, but reported paying only      $12 million to the IRS . . . and finally, 17 of the 100      companies surveyed reported paying no federal income taxes      at all . (And 16 of those utilities were eligible for tax      refunds, but continued to charge ratepayers as if they'd      paid taxes. In fact, Public Service Co. of Oklahoma claimed      a refund of $22.4 million, and then charged its customers      $25.4 million for federal income taxes!)<br />      <br />      <strong>A WIND-POWERED WATER PUMP THAT WORKS IN WIND SPEEDS      AS LOW AS TWO MILES PER HOUR</strong> is now being      manufactured by Cobden Turbines of Mildura, Victoria in      Australia. The 30-bladed rotor mounted at the front of a      jet engine-like air scoop is said to be a substantial      improvement over conventional pumpers, which require wind      speeds of at least eight miles per hour. In addition, the      machine can be rotated horizontally to work as a giant      defroster for protecting orchards: The blades pump higher,      warmer air toward the ground to displace the cold inversion      layer that usually accompanies frost.<br />      <br />      <strong>ELECTRONIC ROAD-USE PRICING IN TRAFFIC-CONGESTED      CITIES</strong> may become a reality if a pilot program      planned for Hong Kong is successful. The scheme involves      installing electronic identification plates in some 5,000      government vehicles . . . and burying sensors tuned to the      tags beneath 30 of the city's most congested intersections.      Whenever a bugged auto or truck passes over a detector, the      "underground tollbooth" will send a signal to a central      computer, which in turn will calculate the appropriate      road-use charge (prices will vary according to the      location, time, and day) and add it to the vehicle's      account. If the test works, every auto and truck in Hong      Kong will be equipped with the tags . . . and drivers will      receive road-use bills in the mail each month.<br />      <br />      <strong>A COAL-POWERED CADILLAC ELDORADO</strong> has been      developed by GM and is housed at the General Motors      Technical Center in Warren, Michigan. The auto runs on      finely powdered coal dust that's mixed with air and      injected into a firing chamber in small, metered amounts.      The car's builders say that the vehicle demonstrates the      fuel economy and power of a small conventional V-8, but      there are some problems . . . namely, very slow      acceleration, engine-damaging particulates, and high levels      of nitrogen oxide emissions. Researchers at GM and      elsewhere, however, are working to overcome those      obstacles.<br />      <br />      <strong>NUCLEAR POWER IS IN TROUBLE IN EUROPE,      TOO:</strong> Spain has "indefinitely deferred"      construction of five nuclear generating plants, including      three that were already partially built at a cost of $2.2      billion. And in France, six planned reactors have been      shelved . . . while remaining nuclear power construction in      that country is expected to raise utility rates by at least      7% above inflation each year.<br />      <br />      <strong>BOATS THAT "SWIM" LIKE PORPOISES</strong> may be in      our future if a new marine propulsion system, demonstrated      by engineers at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, proves      popular. The scientists installed a horizontal finlike      "propeller"a-9" X 30" sheet of flexible aluminum with      a rubber edge-on a small motorboat, and connected it      to the vessel's engine with a rotary cam and pushrods that      move the device up and down like a porpoise's tail. The      flipper proved to be 30% more efficient than conventional      propellers at speeds under six knots . . . and because it      has no whirling blades, it shouldn't cause injuries.<br />      <br />      <strong>WE'RE GETTING BETTER, BUT . . .</strong> Cambridge      Energy Research Associates recently reported that more      Americans than ever are conserving energy in the winter.      Ten years ago, the organization says, 85% of us kept our      home interiors at temperatures of at least 70 Â°F, but      today only 45% maintain such a high heat setting. And the      Energy Information Administration (EIA) has also come out      with encouraging news, saying that petroleum consumption in      the U.S. during 1982 declined 5% . . . the fourth year in a      row such a decrease has been noted. But EIA also pointed      out that the average citizen today still consumes 306      million Btu each year: the equivalent of 14 tons of coal,      or 53 barrels of oil, per person.<br />      <br />      <strong>THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA</strong> is actively      seeking contact with firms selling alternative-energy      information and equipment, according to China Industrial      Development, Inc. (Dept. TMEN, 447 West Garvey Avenue,      Suite 130, Monterey Park, California 91754) . . . . British      inventor Alan Freeman has developed a      <strong>PHOTOVOLTAIC-POWERED BICYCLE</strong> . A 21-watt      solar-cell panel mounted on the handlebars drives the      vehicle at speeds up to eight miles per hour in sunshine,      and a standard 12-volt battery takes over on cloudy days      .... Meanwhile, <strong>A SUN-FUELED "SOLAR CAR" HAS      CROSSED NORTH AMERICA</strong> , making the 2,500-mile trip      from Long Beach, California to Daytona Beach, Florida in 18      days. The auto-dubbed "Silent Challenger"-runs      directly on photovoltaic-induced current and will race an      Australian "solar car" across the United States this      June.<br />    </p>
