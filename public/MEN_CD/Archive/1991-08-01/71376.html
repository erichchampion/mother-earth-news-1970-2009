                <p>      Sunday Afternoon    </p>    		    <p>      BY THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER, THE KIDS HAVE swung on the      backyard tire enough times to qualify for frequent flier      miles, and the wading pool toys you bought have      mysteriously disappeared into the pool's own Bermuda      Triangle. And somehow the treehouse you promised them last      winter just seems a little daunting, not to mention      stressful (12 feet is a long way down for a six-year-old;      your nerves aren't that good). What to do? Toys these days      are outrageously expensive, easily broken, and      unnecessarily complicated. And with a month remaining until      school starts, a Sunday afternoon's investment in time can      yield one or more of these natural outdoor playthings,      saving you lots of money-and lots of sanity.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A HORSE SWING:</strong> Check your wooded property      for a young locust or some other tree with a beautiful      curve at its base. The bottom of the trunk will make a      sturdy and graceful swing.    </p>    <p>      To convert the trunk to a swing, first cut it and carry it      to your shed. Strip off the bark-quite an easy task while      the wood is green. Then, using a brace fitted with a      one-inch bit, bore two parallel holes through the      swing-to-be's side, one at each end of the trunk.    </p>        <p>      Next, saw a pair of one-inch diameter lengths, each about      eight inches longer than the width of the log, from a      straight hardwood branch. With the bark removed, blunt the      ends. The stubs should fit snugly in the holes with an end      protruding on either side of the log. Ropes are then      attached to the ends of the crosspieces to suspend the      swing.    </p>    <p>      The hanging horse can be safely used by any child old      enough to hold himself or herself in place on it, and the      height of the swing steed can be easily adjusted to suit      the length of the young rider's legs by letting out or      taking up the rope it hangs by.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A PLAYING PLATFORM:</strong> The next time you have      to cut down trees near your house, you might leave a little      more stump than you ordinarily would. These will make      sturdy foundations on which you can build playing      platforms.    </p>    <p>      To begin, set a post in the ground at a point about six      feet from two serviceable stumps cut to the same level as      the post. Then 2 X 4's are spiked in place running from      each stump and the post to form a triangular base. Nail      some old boards across these beams, and add a small ladder.    </p>        <p>      Because this "platform" is shaded by greenery, it has the      feel of a tree house. It can be a pretend pirate ship, a      goblin's cave, or a knight's castle.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARK PIPELINES:</strong> The remainder of the tree      used to make the horse swing can be stripped and cut into      fenceposts, a process that will produce a pile of curled      bark. A four-year-old can construct a water engineering      project using these leftovers, and though such a homemade      aqueduct might seem just a toy, bark-strip conduits have      been used by pioneers and homesteaders for channeling water      to a house.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BARK BOATS:</strong> Another project using bark      will turn small scraps that are 2 to 2-1/2 inches wide and      3 to 4 inches long into little Viking ships.    </p>        <p>      First, use a nail to press holes into the bark at any      points where you want to locate masts. The uprights are      made from thin sticks whittled to a point on one end.      Trapezoid-shaped pieces of paper or big leaves can serve as      sails. Just slip them onto the sticks and mount the masts      in the nail holes.    </p>    <p>      Add to any pond, pool, or lake and when you blow on the      little sails, the small bark boats slip prettily across the      water. Throw in a few acorns for buoys and you're off to      the races! Don't be too surprised if there are a few      exciting capsizings to watch.    </p>
