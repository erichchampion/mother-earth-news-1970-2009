        <h3>OCTOBER 1998</h3><p>1 Mars now pulling close to the slightly brighter star Regulus in east before dawn.</p><p>3 Moon near Jupiter tonight; in 1841, the "October Gale" was whaling Nantucket's 'worst storm ever. It also sank 40 ships off Cape Cod and dumped 18 inches of snow inland at Middletown, Connecticut.</p><p>4 Battle of Germantown in 1777 featured early morning fog which combined with battle smoke to produce poor visibility in which American colonists mistakenly fired upon each other</p><p>5 Succoth; St. Francis of Assisi's Day; FULL MOON (Harvest Moon), 4:12 p.m. EDT.</p><p>6 Moon just below Saturn tonight.</p><p>7 Mars and star Regulus very close to each other in east before dawn (use binoculars to see contrasting orange of planet and blue-white of star).</p><p>8 This evening or (less likely) on one of the next two, the possibility of seeing quite a few of the rare Draconid meteors (shooting stars) fly out of the north.</p><p>9 Leif Eriksson Day; in 1903, 11 inches of rain fell at Central Park in New York City in 24 hours.</p><p>10 In 1804, the "Snow Hurricane", brought northerly gales from Maine to New Jersey and up to 36 inches of snow in the Green Mountains.</p><p>12 Columbus Day observed; Thanksgiving Day in Canada; Native Americans Day in South Dakota; LAST QUARTER MOON, 7:11 a.m. EDT</p><p>15 In 1954, Hurricane Hazel made landfall at Myrtle Beach, S.C., this day and then went up the coast inland with almost unabated fury, producing great damage all the way to Pennsylvania.</p><p>16 Moon below Mars today before dawn.</p><p>18 Alaska Day.</p><p>19 St. Luke's Little Summer (a supposedly warmer period) begins today.</p><p>20 NEW MOON, 6:09 a.m. EDT</p><p>21 Orionid meteor shower reaches peak before dawn this morning, when a score or more meteors per hour might be seen hurtling from the south if the sky is very clear and the observer is many miles from city lights; tomorrow, sun enters astrological sign Scorpio and (in an unrelated event) the swallows leave San Juan Capistrano.</p><p>23 Saturn at opposition (opposite from the sun in sky, thus rising at sunset and visible all night long) is the brightest object in the southeast at mid-evening, though much less bright than Jupiter, which is shining in the south then; this month, Saturn is slightly brighter than it has been in about a decade and appears slightly larger in telescopes than it has in about two decades!</p><p>24 United Nations Day.</p><p>25 Fall back one hour to standard time (you're supposed to set clocks back one hour at 2 a.m. today, but most of us will go to bed earlier and set our clocks then); this day in 1919, the temperature fell to 10'F below zero in Bismarck, North Dakota.</p><p>26 In 1859, four inches of October snow fell on New York City this day.</p><p>28 FIRST QUARTER MOON, 6:46 a.m. EST, end of St. Luke's Little Summer (see October 19 above).</p><p>29 Stock market collapsed this day in 1929, bringing on the Great Depression.</p><p>30 Venus at superior conjunction with the sun, thus almost directly on the opposite side of the sun from us and unviewable; sun enters constellation Libra at 11 p.m. EST</p><p>31 Halloween; Nevada Day; moon near Jupiter tonight.</p><h3>NOVEMBER 1998</h3><p>1 All Saints Day; in 1966, Los Angeles hit 100 *F this day.</p><p>2 All Souls Day.</p><p>3 Election Day. 4 FULL MOON (Hunter's Moon), 12:18 a.m. EST</p><p>5 Peak of the Taurid meteor shower occurs around now-look for often bright and relatively slow meteors coming out of the east in the evening; Guy Fawkes Day (occasion for fireworks and raise hi fi -making) in England.</p><p>7 Halfway point of autumn; on this day in 1940, the Narrows Bridge at Tacoma, Washington, started vibrating in high winds and collapsed.</p><p>8 First storm warning by U.S. Army Signal Service was issued for the Great Lakes region this day in 1870 by Professor Increase Latham at Chicago.</p><p>9 In 1913, "Freshwater Fury" storm sank eight large ships on Lake Huron, killing 200 people.</p><p>10 LAST QUARTER MOON, 7:28 p.m. EST, Mercury at greatest evening elongation but not easy to see, low in the west-southwest about 30 minutes after sunset.</p><p>11 Veterans Day; Martinmas; start of St. Martin's Summer (supposedly warm period).</p><p>12 Temperature hit 105' F this day in 1906 in Craftonville, California.</p><p>13 Friday the 13th-for third and final time this year; moon to upper right of Mars before dawn this morning; Leonid meteor storm this day in 1833 produced "The Night the Stars Fell on Alabama" (see text of column and Nov. 16-17 below).</p><p>14 Jupiter halts its "retrograde" (westward) motion against the background of stars and resumes "direct" (eastward) motion.</p><p>16 Small chance of great Leonid meteor storm in the hours before dawn tomorrow (see text of column).</p><p>17 Better chance of great Leonid meteor storm late this evening or in hours before dawn tomorrow (see text of column).</p><p>18 NEW MOON, 11:27 EST</p><p>20 End of St. Martin's summer (see Nov. 11 above).</p><p>22 Sun enters astrological sign Sagittarius.</p><p>23 Sun enters constellation Scorpius at 4 a.m. EST</p><p>26 St. Catherine's Day,</p><p>26 Thanksgiving; FIRST QUARTER MOON, 7:23 p.m,</p><p>27 Moon near Jupiter this evening..</p><p>28 Biggest asteroid, Ceres, at opposition (requires binoculars and finder chart to identify-see current issue of Sky & Telescope magazine).</p><p>29 1st Sunday in Advent; sun enters constellation Ophiuchus at 11 p.m. EST, in 1969, 21 vehicles involved in a chain reaction collision in fog on the New Jersey Turnpike; six people killed and 17 injured.</p><p>30 Moon left of Saturn tonight.</p>
