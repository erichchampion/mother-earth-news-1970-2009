                <p>      Anne White-Clergerie reports on an attempt to plumb the      world's largest solar collector:    </p>        		<p>				Today-as energy shortages and      escalating prices force us to accept the indisputable fact      that man has nearly depleted the planet's store of      fossilized solar power-it's apparent that we must      rapidly change our methods of energy production and our      habits of consumption. Windmills, biomass conversion      centers, hydroelectric plants, and solar collectors are      already being used to help us redirect our energy needs      toward renewable sources. And, late last year, another      benign method of harnessing the sun's power became a      reality off the coast of Hawaii.    </p>    <p>      OTEC-or Ocean Thermal Energy Conversionis a      hundred-year-old idea that was brushed aside during the      years of fossil fuel abundance. However-under the      pressure of our recent energy shortages-the concept      has undergone a renaissance which could eventually make the      oceans a significant source of both economical and      environmentally sound power. By taking advantage of the      natural difference in temperature between sun-warmed      surface water and the chilly depths, OTEC is tapping our      planet's largest solar collectors . . . the seas.<br />      <br />      Electricity is generated in an ocean thermal plant through      a Rankine (or condensation/vaporization) cycle. . . the      same basic technique that air conditioners employ. However,      OTEC combines warm and cold water to produce electricity      instead of using electricity to separate warm and cold air.      The theory is rock solid, but until recently OTEC was      nothing more than a good idea.<br />      <br />      Then, in early August of 1979, a converted U.S. Navy dump      scow-moored in 3,000 feet of water off Keahole Point,      Hawaii-became the world's first ocean thermal plant      to produce more electricity than it consumed. So far, the      barge isn't putting out much juice by power plant      standards: Its total capacity is only 50 KW, and 10 KW of      that wattage goes to plant operation . . . but it is a      beginning! The floating power producer-designed and      built by the State of Hawaii, Lockheed Missiles and Space      Company, and the Dillingham Corporation-has      demonstrated that OTEC is more than theory.<br />      <br />      Admittedly, like Edison's first light bulb, Mini-OTEC's      operation is feeble and sometimes cantankerous, but the      real economical application of the concept is almost      entirely a matter of upping the prototype's scale. From the      titanium plate-type heat exchangers (donated by Alfa-Laval      of Sweden) to the Rotoflow turbine/generator system, all of      Mini-OTEC's hardware is off-the-shelf, state-of-the-art      equipment. Similarly, her moorings consist of common      materials such as polyethylene pipe . . . and her anchor is      made of concrete.<br />      <br />      Mini-OTEC pumps up about 2,700 gallons of 40°F water      per minute from 2,500 feet, and employs an equal amount of      80°F surface water. The warm liquid evaporates ammonia      . . . which is circulated through pipes arranged in      heatexchanger fashion. Pressure-developed by the      vaporization of the fluid-then spins a turbine and      power generator. Upon exiting from the turbine, the ammonia      flows into another heat exchanger (located in the cold      water inlet) which condenses the gas and readies it for      reuse.<br />      <br />      One of OTEC's great advantages is that it doesn't pollute.      The temperature of the liquid involved in the process is      changed by only 2 to 3°F . . . so the warm water that's      returned to the sea tends to remain near the surface, and      the cold-in turn-descends to find a layer of      approximately its own density. Thus OTEC merely exploits      the natural ocean patterns of sun-warmed surface water and      deep, cold, arctic currents.<br />      <br />      Of course, as you'd anticipate from any prototype, there      are problems to be worked out. Extensive research has been      going on for the past several years to develop methods to      prevent efficiency-robbing marine organisms-such as      barnacles-from attaching themselves to the heat exchangers.      And there's also the question of how to transmit the energy      generated at an OTEC plant to the mainland. One promising      solution involves the "grazing" concept, which suggests      that the barges be directed by satellites to the warmest      pools of water. The plants would then use their electricity      to produce hydrogen ... which could be shipped in a liquid      state.<br />      <br />      Whatever form the energy potential of the oceans takes,      OTEC will play a role in our shift from nonrenewable to      renewable fuels. With 70% of the earth's surface area      covered by water, the capacity of our seas to hold valuable      solar heat is a resource we cannot afford to ignore.    </p>
