                <h1 id=" title">      MAKE YOUR OWN PECTIN    </h1>    <h5 id="byline">      by JEANNINE ANSLEY    </h5>    <p>      There's just nothing quite like homemade jam. Whether you      spread it on toast, serve it with steamin' hot pancakes, or      just-as I've been known to do-eat it right off      the spoon when nobody's around, this "personal" sweet stuff      seems to hang on to a lot more of the "fresh fruit" flavor      than the store-bought kind ever does.<br />      <br />      However, regardless of how fresh their fruits or berries,      most folks have to use packaged pectin to get their jams      (or jellies) to "set".<br />      <br />      What many spread-makers don't know is that the often      unreliable commercial pectin isn't necessary. You can whip      up a batch of your own "jam jeller" in no time!<br />      <br />      You see, pectin is a natural substance that's found (in one      degree or another) in all fruits. Apples and crab apples      contain the richest concentrations of the thickener,      though, so apples form the base of our recipe:<br />      <br />      <strong>FRUIT PECTIN</strong><br />      <br />      Wash, but don't peel, about seven large tart apples. Cut      them into pieces and add four cups of water and two      tablespoons of lemon juice. Boil the mixture for 40      minutes, then strain it through a diaper or cheesecloth.      Finally, boil the juice for another 20 minutes, pour it      into sterilized jars, and seal them.<br />      <br />      <strong>BERRY JAM WITH FRUIT PECTIN</strong><br />      <br />      Clean and crush two quarts of ripe berries (you can use a      sieve to remove the seeds). Put four cups of the mashed      fruit Into a pot, add four cups of honey, and mix the      ingredients together well. Then let the sticky liquid stand      for about an hour.<br />      <br />      After the sixty minutes are up, stir in one cup of fruit      pectin and boil the mixture hard for five minutes (be sure      to stir it all the while). Then just remove the jam from      the heat, skim the top, and stir the spread until it's cool      (about five minutes). Pour the finished spread into      sterilized glasses, and seal them with paraffin.    </p>    <p>      <strong>HOW TO TEST FRUIT JUICES FOR NATURAL      PECTIN</strong>    </p>    <p>      Stir one tablespoon of grain alcohol into one teaspoon of      fruit juice. You can use wood or denatured alcohol,      but-if you do-DON'T TASTE 'EM . . . since wood      and denatured alcohol are poisons.<br />      [1] Juices that are high in natural pectin will form a lot      of bulky, gelatinous material.<br />      [2] Those wish an average pectin content will form a few      pieces of the jelly-like substance.<br />      [3] And juices that are low in pectin content will form      only small, flaky pieces of sediment.    </p>
