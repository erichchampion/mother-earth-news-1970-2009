                    <p>      It's spring in all its splendor, and the whole garden comes      alive! Drink in the petalled fragrance of the apple      blossoms, smell the richness of the soil, roll up your      sleeves, and-to the tune of the honeybee's      symphony-finish up planting your tomatoes. Then as      you laze on the porch swing in the perfumed twilight of a      long, warm evening, listen to the katydids sing as you      dream of the rich harvests to come.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WORDS FROM THE WISE</strong><br />      <br />      It seems there are two things most gardeners just can't get      enough of: fresh, homegrown tomatoes and good green-thumb      advice. Well, Brent Elswick told you how to grow all the      tomatoes you need back in MOTHER NO. 62 ("The Top      Tomatoes", page 40) ... and here's the scoop on several      newsletters that can make your growing activities more      rewarding.<br />      <br />      Probably the best known garden journal is Thomas and Betty      Powell's <em>The Avant Gardener</em> (Dept. TMEN, Box 489,      New York, New York 10028). This fact-and address-packed      compendium of vegetable, fruit, and flower gardening      information is published every two weeks ... and you can      pretty well count on seeing the latest in horticultural      news here first. (The recent three-part discussion of solar      greenhouses was excellent!) Tom and Betty have a special      discount subscription rate for MOTHER-readers: $10 a year      (24 issues) . . . instead of the normal $15.<br />      <br />      The National Association for Gardening publishes a      substantial 20-page tabloid newspaper-titled      <em>Gardens for All News</em> -four times a year.      This organization pays special attention to gardening as a      social phenomenon: community gardening (see MOTHER NO. 62,      page 82), children's programs, and horticultural therapy in      prisons are all subjects of recent articles. The      publication doesn't ignore the practical,      dirt-underthe-fingernails matters, though . . . and with      Dick and Jan Raymond handling the growing and preserving      information, you're sure of good, down-to-earth advice.      When you join the association, you'll automatically receive      a subscription to <em>Gardens for</em> <em>All News</em> .      . . simply send $10 for a year's membership to Gardens for      All, Dept. TMEN, 180 Flynn Avenue, Burlington, Vermont      05401.<br />      <br />      The good folks at Shades of Green (see address below)      publish a quarterly newsletter that's full of fine      information ... and subscribers get some special benefits,      too. For $4.00 a year you'll receive the right to place      free classified ads, have access to reduced-rate seed      specials, and help test new varieties of vegetables and      flowers.<br />      <br />      Sallie Ballantine's <em>The</em> <em>Herb Quarterly</em> is      more than a newsletter. The nicely produced 48-page      magazine contains herbal lore, cultural information, photo      essays, recipes, and access information. It's an excellent      buy at $10 a year ($18 for two years, $25 for three) from      The <em>Herb Quarterly</em> , Dept. TMEN, Box 576,      Wilmington, Vermont 05363.<br />      <br />      <strong>TIME TO RE-SEED?</strong><br />      <br />      Whether it's as a result of underbuying your early seed      order, or because of a late decision to put in a fall crop      of cauliflower and brussels sprouts, you will sometimes      have occasion to purchase a few packets of plantables after      the early spring rush.<br />      <br />      This year, why not give your "late" business to some of the      small home-based seed houses? You'd do well to check out      the offerings of such folks as Gene and Dee Milstein of      Applewood Seeds (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 400, Golden, Colorado      80401) , who sell a variety of wildflower seeds along with      their more conventional products ... John and Mary Beedle      of Shades of Green (Dept. TMEN, Box 57, Ipswich,      Massachusetts 01938), who-for 25 cents-will      send you their catalog, and a copy of the 50%off sale list,      and a full-sized packet of basil seed . . . the Sinophiles      at Sunrise Enterprises (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box 10058,      Elmwood, Connecticut 06110), who offer what is probably the      largest selection of Oriental vegetable seeds in this      country . . . our friends at Epicure Seeds (Dept. TMEN, Box      69, Avon, New York 14414), who comb the European catalogs      to bring the finest continental vegetables to American      gardens ... and the good people at Pine Tree Seeds (Dept.      TMEN, P.O. Box 1399, Portland, Maine 04104) , who      specialize in small packets at greatly reduced prices (12      hybrid tomato seeds will cost you between 25 cents and      40 cents) .<br />      <br />      If it's hot stuff you're after, you might want to send      25 cents to Horticultural Enterprises (Dept. TMEN, P.O. Box      340082, Dallas, Texas 75234) for its catalog of 31 types of      peppers ... hot, sweet, and in-between. And, finally, here      are two outfits that cater to green-thumb gourmets: J.A.      Demonchaux (Dept. TMEN, 827 North Kansas Avenue, Topeka,      Kansas 66608, catalog 25 cents ) and Le Jardin du Gourmet      (Dept. TMEN, Box 22, West Danville, Vermont 05873, catalog      50 cents). The latter firm will send MOTHERreaders eight      packets of herb seeds -and a catalog-for only $1.00 ... or      12 packets of herbs plus a quarter pound of French shallots      for $2.95.</p>    		<p>      <em>Always check your wild food identifications, even with      day lilies!</em>    </p>    <p>      Did you ever stop to think just how many flowers are      edible? I'm not talking about exotic treats like candied      violets, but everyday goodies such as spicy nasturtium      blossoms (which add color and tang to summer salads) . . .      calendula, marigold, and safflower petals (all of which can      be used to color rice a vibrant yellow) . . . and crunchy,      unopened day lily buds (and the delicious fritters that the      opened blossoms make when dipped in batter and fried). Why,      you can even top off a meal of dandelion bud fritters with      a tasty glass of dandelion wine that's also made from the      yellow flowers. Of course, many of our more traditional      vegetables-such as artichokes, broccoli, and      cauliflower-are actually blossoms, too . . . so      please do eat these "daisies"!    </p>
