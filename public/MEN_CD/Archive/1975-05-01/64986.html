                      <p>      While looking through MOTHER the other day-and being      amazed at the variety of information that passes through      her pages-I realized that I too have a skill that      should be shared. It's a humble accomplishment, but one      that few people seem to know: zipper repair.    </p>    <p>      Inevitably, it's the zipper do your favorite pair of pants      that pulls apart. . . and even if you have some sewing      skill, you probably dread the thought of replacing the      device. (It always seems harder to fit a new closure into      an already-put-together opening than it is to make the      trousers in the first place.) One option is to sew buttons      on the underside of the fly and make buttonholes on the      overlapping flap . . . but if you like zippers better,      don't, for heaven's sake, banish the garment to the ragbag.      The damaged fastener may well be fixable.    </p>    <p>      The usual problem is that the zipper head (see the drawing)      has pulled off one side of the teeth and ceased to connect      the gap. Well, all is not lost. Turn the pants inside out      and look at the lower end of the fastening. You'll probably      see two, three, or four metal prongs or a metal rectangle      (depending on which side the fitting was put in from). This      is the stop, which keeps the head of the zipper from,      scooting off the track at the bottom.    </p>    <p>      With pliers (needle-nosed are the easiest to use), pry open      the prongs and remove the stop. Don't lose it! There may be      stitching across the zipper tapes instead of, or in      addition to, the metal barrier. In that case, take out      enough of the thread to free the inside and lower edges of      the cloth tabs.    </p>    <p>      The next step is to slip the head off the zipper. If the      device will move only upward, unsew just the edges of the      garment's waistband to permit removal of the slider from      the top.    </p>    <p>      A look at the zipper's head will show you that either the      top or the bottom-but not both-is divided into      two holes, and that a pull-tab is mounted on the front.      With the double-holed end up, and the tab raised and facing      the front of the pants, ease the end of the left tape into      the left hole on the slider. Then, keeping the head below      all of the zipper's teeth, work the right tape into the      right hole. This is the hardest part of the business and      calls for a lot of dexterity and maneuvering on occasion.      In case the bits of cloth are frayed, you can help matters      by trimming or wetting them. Be patient and keep trying.    </p>    <p>      Once the head is on the tapes, hold the cloth tabs with      their ends even and slide the zipper's moving part up onto      the teeth.    </p>    <p>      Pull it along far enough to see how the fastener behaves.      Are the tapes still aligned properly? If not, slip the head      back onto the cloth and start again. Do the teeth mesh? No?      Try moving the head farther up the track. Still no luck? It      may help to interlock the portion of the zipper below the      head by hand, and then run the slider up and down. Don't      worry about any teeth that are missing near the bottom . .      . just get the gadget working above that point. Even a      zipper with gaps in the middle may operate once you get it      started, if you're gentle enough. In any case, keep trying!      I often don't get the zipping action going on my-first      attempt.    </p>    <p>      When you've finally persuaded the zipper to mesh properly,      close it halfway. If you had to undo part of the waistband,      safety-pin the tapes together at the top so the head won't      fall off.    </p>    <p>      Replace the stop by poking the prongs back through the tape      and clamping them down with pliers. The guard will be      stronger if you place it over some of the lower teeth (and      be sure to bypass any that are defective or absent, by      locating the metal barrier above that area).    </p>    <p>      In case the stop is missing-or too mangled to      use-sew the tapes together securely near or over the      bottom teeth. Finish the repair, if necessary, by redoing      the sewing at the zipper's lower end and on the waistband.    </p>    <p>      Trouser zippers aren't, of course, the only ones that can      be mended. They just happen to be on my mind right now      because I found my favorite old pants-the ones with      the busted fastener-in the basement while visiting my      folks. I fixed them up just fine and am enjoying the      reunion.    </p>    <p>      Actually, I learned the above process at the National      Outdoor Leadership School, where we used it to repair      fastenings on tents and pack bags. It seemed complicated at      first but saved the time, effort, and expense of replacing      a myriad of zippers that had been derailed by hard use. And      there was rarely any need to baby the equipment after      overhaul, either. (Incidentally, coil      zippers-commonly used on outdoor equipment-like      to come unsprung from their tapes and can often be resewn.      Just study the device to figure out how it's fastened, and      replace the stitches neatly.)    </p>    <p>      Oh, yes, one more thing: A sticky zipper will run smoothly      if you rub it with paraffin.    </p>    <p>      I hope this information proves useful. I've learned a lot      of handy things from MOTHER's readers and would like to      return the favor.    </p>
