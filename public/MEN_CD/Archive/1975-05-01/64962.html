    <p>
                    <p>      Early spring can be a lean time on the homestead, what with      last year's supplies being nearly used up and next season's      garden not even in the ground yet. Or-to look on the      positive side-it's a good season to dig out the odds      and ends of grain, dried fruit, stored vegetables, or what      have you and get creative with them . . . with the help of      some highly adjustable recipes like the following.    </p>    <p>      After two and a half years of marriage I've started to      compile my own recipes . . . and, since I dislike the      narrow confinements of most cooking directions, I've      loosened a few formulas somewhat to allow for choice. I      find this method refreshing and much more educational than      just following orders.    </p>    <p>      Here are some samples of my "play-it-by-ear" cookery;    </p>    <h3>      CREATIVE MUFFINS    </h3>    <p>      [1] 2 cups whole-wheat flour. Use your imagination and      substitute 1/4 to 1/2 cup of the following for part of the      measurement:    </p>    <p>      Rye, barley, triticale, soy, or buckwheat flour. (Since the      last two are very heavy, add an extra teaspoon or more      baking powder or half teaspoon or more baking soda to the      recipe for each half cup or more used.)    </p>    <p>      Uncooked hot breakfast cereals    </p>    <p>      Bran or wheat germ    </p>    <p>      Dry cooked grains such as rice or wheat    </p>    <p>      Any other flours or grain available. Oats or cornmeal can      be substituted up to 1 cup. Experiment!    </p>    <p>      [2] 1 cup milk. This can be dried, goat, soy, butter, or      sour. (If the liquid is acid use baking soda for leavening      in Step 8.) To sour sweet milk, mix 1 cup with 1 tablespoon      lemon juice or vinegar and let the combination stand in a      warm oven or similar place.    </p>    <p>      [3] 1 egg (or make egg replacer: Combine 1 heaping      tablespoon soy flour with 1/2 cup water, boil the two      ingredients slowly and stir them constantly until they're      thick. Strain the mixture and add a little butter or oil.)    </p>    <p>      [4] 1/2 to 1 teaspoon salt (omit or reduce if you need or      want to . . . or substitute sea salt or tamari).    </p>    <p>      [5] 3 to 4 tablespoons melted butter or oil. I don't know a      substitute. Do you? ( <em>Try lard-MOTHER</em>      <em>)</em>    </p>    <p>      [6] 1/2 to 1 cup raisins, or any of the following:    </p>    <p>      Dates, currants, figs, or other dried fruit    </p>    <p>      2 small or 1 medium tart, green summer apples, cored,      pared, and finely chopped or grated    </p>    <p>      1 to 1 /2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries    </p>    <p>      Cranberries, peaches, bananas, or other fresh fruit    </p>    <p>      Coconut    </p>    <p>      Nuts or roasted soybeans    </p>    <p>      A combination of the above    </p>    <p>      [7] 1 teaspoon or more vanilla (optional . . . or use      orange, lemon, or almond extract, etc.).    </p>    <p>      [8] 3 to 4 teaspoons baking powder. If you make the muffins      with buttermilk, sour milk, or sweet milk soured with all      lemon juice or vinegar, substitute 1/2 to I teaspoon baking      soda . . . or 1/2 to one teaspoon baking powder and 1/2      teaspoon soda.    </p>    <p>      [9] 1 tablespoon honey, You can use up to 1/4 of a cup . .      . or substitute maple syrup, malt flavoring, or molasses .      . , or omit all such ingredients and sweeten the batter      with fruit juice. Please don't add sugar! It's very bad for      you.    </p>    <p>      Mix all your choices thoroughly and bake the batter in a      well-greased muffin pan at 400° for about 15 minutes,      or until the cakes are raised and golden brown and a      toothpick inserted into the dough comes out clean. The      muffins are best served hot. Yield: about <em>one</em>      <em>dozen</em> <em>.</em>    </p>    <h3>      CREATIVE SOUP    </h3>    <p>      Small amount of butter (if desired)<br />      1 tablespoon flour<br />      Carrots (clean well and cut in strips, chunks, <em>or</em>      rounds)<br />      Celery (with tops)<br />      Potatoes<br />      Onions<br />      Greens<br />      Corn (hulled)<br />      Peas<br />      Cabbage (tear into pieces)<br />      Turnips Beets (use the greens too)<br />      Parsnips<br />      Leftover vegetables, or others such as seaweed<br />      Barley, rice, wheat, or other grains<br />      Bones and chopped meat (if you eat it)    </p>    <p>      In a large soup pot, melt the butter-if you're using      any-and thicken it with 1 tablespoon flour or an      equivalent. Prepare about 6 cups of the other ingredients      (singly or in combination), place them in the kettle, and      cover them with stock (if you have some). Otherwise, use      water one: add any of the following:    </p>    <p>      Leftover gravy or bouillon<br />      1 tablespoon or more miso (for winter soup)<br />      Tamari, Kelp , , . etc.    </p>    <p>      Cook the mixture as slowly as possible, with the lid on      tight (this brings out the flavor). When the vegetables are      almost tender, season the soup as you wish (garlic, salt,      pepper, thyme, parsley, a bay leaf, oregano, lemon juice,      butter, sprouts, etc, if you like, crack a raw egg into the      pot.) Continue the cocking until the ingredients are just      done. Serve the brew with homemade whole-wheat toast or      crackers.    </p>        <p>      For bean or pea soup, use the following singly or in any      combination:    </p>    <p>      Soy, lima, black, pinto, or navy beans<br />      Lentils<br />      Green peas    </p>    <p>      Add-if you wish-grains, meat, and chopped onion, and      proceed as shave, Chili is a good seasoning.    </p>    <h3>      CREATIVE GRANOLA    </h3>    <p>      2 to 1 cups rolled eats<br />      2 to 5 cups rolled wheat flakes<br />      1 to 2 cups wheat germ<br />      1/2 cup bran<br />      1 cup sunflower seeds<br />      1/4 to 1 cup sesame seeds<br />      1/2 to 2 cups coconut, shredded<br />      1 to 2 cups chapped nuts (peanuts, almonds, or      others)<br />      1 to 2 cups dark raisins<br />      1 cup chopped dates<br />      1 cup chapped prunes<br />      1 cup chapped dried apples<br />      1 cup chapped dried apricots (or other dried fruit)<br />      1/4 cup powdered milk (optional)<br />      1/8 cup brewer's yeast (optional)<br />      1/2 cup oil or melted butter<br />      1/2 cup honey or maple syrup (or use 1 full cup of this      sweetening and omit the fat immediately above)<br />      1 teaspoon to 1 tablespoon vanilla or almond flavoring    </p>        <p>      The above are possibilities, to be used according to your      creativeness. Take 10 to 13 drops of the dry ingredients .      . . being stare to include oat flakes, wheat flakes, and/or      wheat germ, and at least a couple of others: nut and/or      seeds, fruit, and/or coconut. Mix these well with the      shortening-and-sweetener combination and flavoring    </p>    <p>      Spread the granola out thin on a cookie sheet and bake it      in a 350° oven from 20 to 30 minutes. Watch the mixture      carefully and stir it now and again until it's golden      brown. Then cool the cereal completely for storage in      airtight containers. This is good as a breakfast food, or      on baked apples and ether wholesome desserts    </p>    <h3>      CREATIVE NATURAL FRUITCAKE    </h3>    <p>      1/2 to 1 cup honey (for light fruitcakes) . . . molasses      (far dark)<br />      1 cup oil or melted butter<br />      8 eggs, separated<br />      2 cups whole-wheat flour (or other, or a combination      )<br />      1 teaspoon each ground cinnamon, allspice, and<br />      nutmeg<br />      1/2 teaspoon each ground cloves, mace, and ginger<br />      1/2 to 1 teaspoon vanilla (optional, or use lemon, orange,      or almond extract or some other flavoring)<br />      1/4 cup fruit wine, rum, grape juice, or apple mead<br />      1-1/2 pounds raisins, currants, and/or dates in any      combination<br />      Rind of 3 oranges and 3 lemons, grated (optional)    </p>    <p>      2 pounds mixed dried fruit (apricots, apples, pears, figs,      prunes, etc.)-please, not sugared-or 1 pound      mixed dried fruit and 1 pound coarsely chopped nuts      (pecans, walnuts, roasted soybeans, etc.) . . . or 2 pounds      chopped nuts or roasted soybeans.    </p>    <p>      Blend the honey or molasses, shortening, and egg yolks.      Sift together the flours and spices. (Reserve a small      amount to sprinkle on the dried fruits-if you use      there-and add the remaining flour and the coated      fruit to the egg mixture). Stir in whatever rinds and nuts      you may be using. Beat the egg white, until stiff and fold      them in gently.    </p>    <p>      Turn flee batter into oiled loaf pans (without quite      filling them). Oil some waxed paper, lay it over the tops      of the the tops of the containers, and secure it with      string. Put a large pan of hot water an the lower rack of      the oven, set the cakes above it and bake them at 300°      about three hours. (The tops should be golden brown and      cracked, and a toothpick inserted into the centers should      come out clean.) Cool the loaves thoroughly. Then turn them      out wrap them well, and store them in a container along      with some cut apples to keep them moist. If the cakes dry      out anyhow, you can pour over them a little more of      whatever liquid you used in their making.    </p>    <p>      <em>(Fruitcakes keep a long time, either frozen or packed      as</em> <em>Teresa</em> <em>describes. If uou have dried      fruit and nuts</em> <em>left</em> <em>from last</em>      <em>harvest, you can make the above recipe now-before      the outdoor work gets really overwhelming-and enjoy      the loaves near fall. Incidentally, wedding cakes are      traditionally supposed to be of this type. . . and if you      or any of your friends are getting married shortly, you      might like to revive the custom.-MOTHER.)</em>    </p>
