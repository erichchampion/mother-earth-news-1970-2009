        <p>As mentioned several times in the past (see the poster in MOTHER NO. 26, page 16 in NO. 27, pages 18-19 in N0. 28, and page 17 in NO. 31), THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>(restricted) is in the process of developing a small, twoseat, 60 mpg town car that weighs only a quarter as much as a "standard" Detroit automobile and costs a great deal less-in both dollars and resources-than any Motor City vehicle now costs. Work is now progressing nicely on that car and we should have some knockout photos to show you in MOTHER NO. 34.</p><p>In the meantime, however, it's only honest to tell you that a whole bunch of other folks are also working on ultra-light, ultra-efficient, ultra-etc. town cars too.</p><p>People like Bob Way; who now lives at the Rex Sunoco Station, Rt. 9W, Coxsackie, New York 12051. And the <em>reason</em> Bob lives at the station (well, almost lives there anyway) is because he's just spent a long, cold winter designing and building a little two-place town car of his own.</p><p>"My little bug has less than 90 parts including the body, engine, drive train, etc.," says Bob. "The body is 4-oz. Dacron over plywood frames which, in turn, are bolted to a steel framework. The machine is driven by a 293cc singlecylinder engine geared through a torque converter to give both snappy initial acceleration and a top speed of 70 mph.</p><p>"I've designed the vehicle as a three-wheeler because, in most states, anything with three wheels is considered a motorcycle instead of a car . . . and is therefore subject to less red tape and restrictions. I was also shooting for a vehicle that would cost less than $1,000 and which locally trained people could produce from locally available materials at the rate of five or ten units per week in a space no bigger than the average muffler shop."</p><p>And if nobody is interested in such a "backyard" manufacturing opportunity? Bob says he'll be happy to redesign his little machine for mass production. "All I want in such a case," he states, "is an engineering fee and a 1% royalty on the retail price of each vehicle sold."</p><p>Fair enough. So, whether you're interested in producing five little town cars a week or 5,000, here's a red-hot lead on a feller who's already started down that road and who's interested in working with you. There's no question about the fact that Bob's got a lot of work ahead of him yet . . . but we think he'll get it all done. Why? Because we know this boy. After all, he helped us a year ago when we were putting together the prototype of the prototype of MOTHER's own little urban vehicle!</p>
