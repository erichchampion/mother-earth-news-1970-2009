        <p>From using biodiesel in their buses to serving locally grown food in their cafeterias, universities that belong to the Association for the Advancement of Sustainability in Higher Education (AASHE) are taking steps to reduce their environmental impact and build stronger, more self-sufficient communities.</p><p>AASHE began in 2005 and now boasts a membership of more than 250 colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada. Member universities not only shine sustainable in their operations, policies and research, but many now offer sustainability-related degrees, prepping tomorrow’s grads for careers in areas like organic agriculture and renewable energy applications.</p><p>Attending an AASHE university has other perks, too: Everyone on campus can receive discounted attendance to many green conferences and workshops, along with access to online publications, presentations and resources shared from other universities focused on sustainability. Visit the AASHE <a href="http://www.aashe.org/" target="_blank">website</a> to get more info, and to see whether your alma mater is on the list.</p>
