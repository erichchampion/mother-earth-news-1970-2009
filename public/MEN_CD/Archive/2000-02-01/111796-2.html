        <strong>Couscous</strong>:Although we treat it as a grain, couscous is really a baby pasta made of semolina from durum wheat flour, which is used to make most pastas. White or whole wheat couscous is available in different-size granules. I prefer whole wheat because it's more nutritious and just as delicious. Couscous is ready in minutes by soaking it in boiling water and then fluffing it up with a fork.
