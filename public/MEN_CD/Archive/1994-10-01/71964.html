                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      BY Robert Houghton    </h5>        <p>      <strong>Humankind has always and will forever be judged by      the keenness of its blades.<br />      Here's how to keep your edge at its best.</strong>    </p>        <p>      <em>Of all the time-honored skills withering in the face of      modern convenience, knife sharpening is one we can scarcely      afford to lose. As a tool-using species, it was one of our      first and most fundamental technologies. A sharp knife is      essential in controlling our environment, in separating      part A from part B without using our teeth. Once humankind      loses the ability to create and maintain a sharp edge, we      become little more than savages with clubs and      microwaves.</em>    </p>    <p>      Modern slicers and dicers often regard sharpness as an      unnecessary extravagance, on par with leather seats in a      sports car. But the truth is, far from being a performance      option, a keen edge makes the difference between wielding      an efficient tool and a dangerous, uncontrollable weapon.    </p>    <p>      Knife sharpening, like taxes, is a subtractive business. In      theory, material is intentionally removed in the hopes that      some good will come of it. My own first attempts, however,      yielded nothing more than oily fingers and frustration. The      process seems deceptively simple - rub the knife      against a rock until its steel yields an edge. Eventually,      I learned that almost no skill is required at all if one      starts with the proper stone, the right lubricant, and a      certain willingness to cheat.    </p>    <p>      Viewed under high magnification, a knife edge has jagged      teeth like a saw. The trick in sharpening is to hone these      teeth until they are as small as possible while lining them      up smartly in a row. This is accomplished by first grinding      a bevel onto the knife to establish the cutting edge, then      smoothing the bevel with progressively finer stones until      the desired degree of sharpness is reached.    </p>        <p>      Sharper is not always necessarily better. The finer the      work, the sharper the knife, and the finer the stone you      will need. I read somewhere that Japanese samurai once      gauged the keenness of their swords by how many peasants in      a row they could halve with one swipe. Such an edge would      also be entirely suitable for slicing tomatoes or boning      chicken. On the other hand, such a keen blade would dull      very quickly cutting linoleum or frozen food.    </p>    <p>      My favorite stones are quarried from natural beds of      novaculite in Arkansas. The coarsest, thus fastest cutting      grade, is called washita, or soft Arkansas. It is light      gray to tan with beautiful striations of color that mark      its sedimentary beginnings. A washita stone will hone as      fine an edge as most people want. For finer polishing and      greater sharpness, a hard Arkansas stone the color and      texture of fine white marble can be used.    </p>    <p>      I admit I'm a romantic; sharpening on a beautifully colored      rock is the chief advantage of novaculite. There are also      many excellent - though less pretty - synthetic      stones. The local hardware store will likely skip the      romance and carry only these. They are often available as a      "combination" stone that sandwiches medium grit for      beveling on one side, fine grit for honing on the other.      Get the largest one you can. Trying to sharpen a long knife      on a small stone is like trying to park a Cadillac in      Manhattan.    </p>        <p>      Use water, kerosene, or special sharpening oil as a      lubricant on the stone. I keep the surface of my stone      almost submerged while sharpening. It's impossible to use      too much. Avoid the temptation to use your favorite 10W-30      or other motor oil; it is too viscous and will make it      difficult to feel the stone under the steel, a bit like      washing your feet with your socks on. Also avoid dry      sharpening. The stone will quickly clog. I periodically use      a vegetable brush and hot soapy water to clean the metal      particles out of the stone's pores.    </p>    <p>      Before beginning to sharpen, I use a bright light to sight      along the knife's edge. If there is any hint of light      reflected from the cutting edge itself, the knife must be      rebeveled. For general use, this means honing a constant      24-degree angle along the entire cutting edge - 12      degrees per side. For heavy-duty cutting, increase the      angle slightly. I use a medium-grit stone for the initial      beveling to make things go faster.    </p>    <p>      There is one and only one skill in sharpening -      finding and maintaining the aforementioned angle as the      knife is drawn across the stone. Luckily for me, there is a      simple and honorable way to cheat.    </p>    <p>      Put a stack of pennies on one end of the stone, two for      every half inch of blade width. If you start the knife with      its back edge on the pennies, this will place the blade at      the correct angle. Then, bearing down hard, draw the knife      across the stone and down its length as if slicing a firm      cheese - an aged cheddar, perhaps. Concentrate. Watch      closely to make sure the knife-to-stone angle remains      constant. To maintain the correct bevel around the tip of      the knife, pivot the handle of the knife upward at the end      of each slice. Take an equal number of strokes on each side      and go slowly. This will take some patience.    </p>    <p>      As the blade sharpens, it will just perceptibly begin to      drag on the stone. If you are beveling, switch to a      fine-honing stone and repeat the process. If you are      honing, it is time to check the edge. I test the edge on my      thumbnail. If sharp, the knife will catch in the nail; if      very sharp, it can whittle small curls of nail-like wood      shavings.    </p>    <p>      As with any culturally important activity, there are      certain taboos to observe. Avoid those kitchen knife      sharpeners in which the knife is dragged through a slot.      These shred the steel at a microscopic level, leaving the      edge ragged and quick to dull. Don't rely on a sharpening      steel instead of a stone. Using a steel may be picturesque,      with blades and elbows waving about in the air, but it is      useful only for touching up an already good edge and will      not sharpen a dull one. And don't use a motorized grinder.      Heat buildup on a grinding wheel can draw the temper out of      steel almost instantly, ruining a good knife's ability to      hold an edge.    </p>    <p>      The cutting edge of all human technology has always been      defined in terms of its best cutting edge: first stone,      then copper, bronze, iron, and finally steel. Now we're      supposed to be a bit more technologically oriented, but we      still have onions to dice. So long as there is some part of      modern life that is not preportioned and shrink-wrapped, we      will need good, sharp knives. And good knives ought, now      and then, to taste a bit of oil and to feel the bite of a      good stone.    </p>
