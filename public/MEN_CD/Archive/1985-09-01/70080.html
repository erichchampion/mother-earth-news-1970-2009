                <p>      My old man always said, "Huntin' squirrel is easy; just sit      out in the woods and act like a nut. "    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">      by Lance Sterling    </h5>    <p>      There are a good many reasons why squirrels are among the      most hunted animals in North America. For one thing, the      bushy-tail season usually opens before those for larger      animals do, and provides an excuse to enjoy the      early-autumn woods. Then too, squirrels are more numerous      than any other huntable animal except possibly rabbits.      Because of this, productive woods are often accessible to      youngsters who have to be able to reach their hunting areas      by foot. The weapons used for squirrel hunting-and      the skills required-also demand less of an investment      on the part of beginners, be they young or old. And,      finally, squirrel meat has been recognized as a delicious      food since long before the first Europeans settled on our      shores.    </p>    <p>      The best way to locate a good squirrel woods is simply to      be in the country-hiking, camping, or      fishing-before the season begins. Listen for the      barks and chatters of those often vocal animals, and keep      your eyes peeled for nests and for the gnawed nutshells,      pinecones, corncobs, or fungi that indicate squirrels have      been feeding.    </p>    <p>      Once you've located a spot and the season opens (in some      parts of the country, squirrels are fair game year-round),      your hunt can be as simple or as complicated as you'd like.      The back-to-basics approach is simply to dress in      comfortable clothes (with a blaze orange vest, in orange      camouflage pattern if you prefer, for safety) and set      yourself down in a likely-looking grove of trees. The      early- to mid-morning and mid- to late-afternoon hours are      often the most productive. (Be sure to get permission to      hunt if the woods are on private land.)    </p>    <p>      Most squirrel hunters use either a .22 rifle or a shotgun.      If you choose the latter, which will make it possible to      shoot running animals, I'd recommend nothing smaller than      No. 5 shot. Despite their size, squirrels are hard to kill;      for that reason, hunters using a .22 should never shoot at      a moving animal, and should always use hard-hitting      hollow-point bullets. To do otherwise is to risk watching a      wounded animal escape. In any hunting you owe it to your      quarry not to shoot unless you're confident of a quick,      clean kill.    </p>    <p>      A variation of the sit-and-wait technique is still-hunting,      which involves moving slowly and quietly through the woods,      stopping in likely spots for up to half an hour at a time,      and keeping your eyes and ears peeled.    </p>    <p>      Or if you want to get complicated, you can use a call to      locate your game, or even invest in a trained squirrel dog      (called a fice dog in the South), which will tree squirrels      and circle the tree to force a hidden animal to give its      position away.    </p>    <p>      Whatever method you use, keep in mind that a hunted      squirrel can remain motionless, and all but invisible, for      hours at a time. If you find yourself searching fruitless      ly for a squirrel that suddenly disappears, you can follow      several courses of action. First, if there's any breeze,      look for the movement of blowing fur rather than trying to      spot the whole animal. Or if you're with a friend, one of      you can sit still while the other circles the tree noisily,      perhaps causing the squirrel to move around the trunk to      keep the tree between it and the more obvious hunter. If      alone, you can try hanging your coat from a limb in view of      the tree, then circling the trunk yourself. In fleeing you,      the animal may think it's exposed itself to another hunter      (the coat), and scoot into your view. Or, finally, you can      just plunk yourself down and try to wait the squirrel out.      It might take a long time, and you might even run out of      day before that squirrel shows itself, but if you've never      spent an afternoon sitting motionless in the woods, I can      guarantee that you'll see and hear things that are every      bit as rewarding as bringing a squirrel home for the pot!    </p><hr />    <h3>      SIXTY-SECOND SKINNING</h3>      <p>Winnie H. Hodgson    </p>    <p>      A lot of people dread skinning and cleaning animals.      However, there's probably no factor that has more influence      on the flavor of wild meat than the speed with which the      carcass is cleaned and cooled after the animal is taken. It      stands to reason, then, that a quick method of skinning and      cleaning will result in better eating and less wasted meat      . . . and wasted meat is among the worst possible outcomes      of a hunt.    </p>    <p>      Virginian Dick Charlton recently passed on some      squirrel-skining secrets that should help a lot of you eat      well this fall. With his technique and a little practice,      you'll be able to remove a squirrel's pelt in less than a      minute.    </p>    <p>      Here's how it's done. First-and, Dick notes, this is      the most critical step-make a horizontal cut across      the underside of the squirrel's tail at the base. Slice      through the skin and tailbone, but don't cut the skin on      the upper side of the tail. Next, extend that cut, from      each of its ends, about an inch down the inside thigh of      each hind leg, put the squirrel on the ground, place your      foot on the base of the tail, grab the hind legs, and pull      slowly. This will peel the hide from the animal's back and      around to the middle of its belly, leaving a V-tipped patch      of fur on the belly, with its point facing the head.    </p>    <p>      Continue until you've pulled the skin down over the      forelegs and neck. Then use your other hand to slip the      front legs out of the skin. With that done, grab the point      of the V, pull it toward the squirrel's anus, and skin out      the hind legs.    </p>    <p>      Finally, remove the anus and intestines, cut off the head      and feet, and soak the meat in cool, salted water (a      tablespoon per quart) for several hours before cooking.    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't go out on a limb when preparing your first      squirrel dinner.

Bashline</p>			    <p>      3 squirrels, cut into pieces<br />      1 egg<br />      fine bread crumbs<br />      2 tablespoons butter or margarine<br />      2 tablespoons cooking oil<br />      1/2 cup white wine<br />      1/2 cup orange juice<br />      pepper to taste    </p>    <p>      Dry squirrel pieces on paper towels. Beat egg thoroughly.      Dip squirrel in the beaten egg and then roll in bread      crumbs. (I use flavored bread crumbs. If you don't, add a      little garlic and onion salt and minced parsley and mix      well.) Brown squirrel on all sides in hot butter and oil in      large frying pan over medium-high heat. Add wine and orange      juice to the pan, cover, and turn the heat to simmer. Cook      until all the pieces are fork-tender-45 minutes to 1      hour for young squirrels. Turn pieces once during the      cooking. Serves 4.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Sylvia is the food editor of Field and      Stream magazine.
