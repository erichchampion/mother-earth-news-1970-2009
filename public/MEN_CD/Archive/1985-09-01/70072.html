                <p>      <em>Right now is the best time to test your garden soil.      But which "earth exam" should you give?</em>    </p>        <p>      Point number one: While the best indicator of your garden      soil's quality is how well your crops grow in it, a test of      major chemical nutrients should provide a useful check on      your plot's condition.    </p>    <p>      Point number two: The best time to test your soil is in the      fall. Not only will any organic nutrients you add in      response to the test results have time to decompose in the      soil, but you'll be a whole lot more likely to get those      results promptly. (You may have to wait six weeks or more      to get a mail-ordered kit or audit in spring!)    </p>    <p>      Point number three: The test you should use is . . . uh, is      . . . well, what is the best garden soil test? Have you      ever wondered? We often have, so to try to satisfy our      curiosity, we carefully unearthed a sample of Eco-Village      garden soil-following all the recommended guidelines,      such as taking the sample from several representative spots      and being careful not to touch it with our hands or      galvanized tools. Then we ran some of that sample through      <em>five</em> different tests so that we-and      you-could compare the results.    </p>    <p>      We used two do-it-yourself <em>kits:</em> the least      expensive Sudbury model ($13.04 at our local nursery) and      the LaMotte garden kit (model EL; $25.30 plus shipping from      LaMotte Chemical, P.O. Box 329, Chestertown, MD 21620). We      also sent off for three soil <em>audits:</em> one by our      local agricultural extension service (available-at      little or no cost-in most areas of the country) . . .      a "standard audit" by Woods End Laboratory (Orchard Hill      Rd., RFD Box 128, Temple, ME 04984; $20.00) . . . and the      "basic soil audit" by Necessary Trading Company (328 Main      St., New Castle, VA 24127; $19.50). Incidentally, if you      decide to send a sample to either of the private labs, be      sure to write for a questionnaire and sampling instructions      before you do so.    </p>    <p>      And what did we find out for all our efforts?    </p>    <h3>      THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION    </h3>    <p>      The first thing we learned was that no two soil tests use      the same language! Their testing procedures and rating      systems vary, so you can't directly compare most of their      results. For instance, look at our "Test Results" chart      under potassium (K). Sudbury says we need 4% K . . .      LaMotte says our K level is "very high" . . . the county ag      service gives a free-floating "index" number, 286 ... Woods      End tells us we've got 780 pounds per acre of the nutrient      . . . and Necessary tallies our K at 500 parts per million!      Uh, run that by us again?    </p>    <p>      Backup literature (or, in the case of the extension      service, a friendly agent) tells how to interpret these      results into low-to-high terms, though, so we did finally      understand it all. We included those assessments in      parentheses in the chart so you could interpret our      feedback, too.    </p>    <p>      The next thing we learned was a bit more troublesome: The      results <em>don't</em> always agree. Well, they all agree      that our garden's pH is <em>somewhere</em> between 6.1 and      7.0 (a good plant-growing range), and that we have high      levels of potassium and magnesium . . . but after that they      range from "medium" to "quite high" on the same nutrient!      Not surprisingly, then, the interpretations and      recommendations vary, as well.    </p>    <h3>      SO WHAT'S IT ALL MEAN?    </h3>    <p>      That's another good question. If you just look at our "Test      Results" chart, you'll probably conclude that soil testers      are like the proverbial blind men who each feel different      parts of an elephant and therefore each decide it's a      different creature. But that's not really a fair      conclusion. For one thing, we weren't able to include all      the detailed backup descriptions of each test in our      five-in-one chart . . . and those often resolve some      apparent differences. For example, although Woods End      assesses our phosphorus (P) levels as "medium" and three of      the other tests say it's "high," the company's full report      states that, while our "available" level of P is on target,      our "reserve" P level is 70 pounds per acre greater than      desired. Woods End <em>interprets</em> the overall      phosphorus data as "medium," but someone else could look at      those same numbers and say they're high. Similarly, Woods      End reports that our calcium level of 2,300 pounds per acre      is "medium" (Necessary rates it "low"), yet also states      that the desired level is 2,900 pounds per acre.    </p>    <p>      Several other times the interpretation of the data varied      more than the data itself. Still, there were some real      differences in the five replies. You just can't reconcile      LaMotte's "medium" phosphorus rating with Necessary Trading      Company's "quite high" one, for instance. And since the      do-it-yourself kits involved assessing color variations of      liquid in test tubes, those homespun results sometimes      depended on <em>who</em> was reading them. Some people we      showed that LaMotte phosphorus test to thought the liquid      had a light blue tint, indicating a "medium low" level,      while others thought the same tube was a darker,      "medium"-rating blue.    </p>    <p>      Equally interesting were the various assessments of      nitrogen. While the do-ityourself kits quite confidently      reported nitrogen levels, the results from the three      services were much more equivocal. Both Woods End and      Necessary admitted that their nitrogen numbers were made-up      estimates based on such things as the amount and type of      organic matter in the sample, while our local ag service      didn't even <em>pretend</em> to be able to measure itthere      isn't even an N category on its form! Steve Rioch of      Necessary explained the nitrogen problem to us: "The irony      is that the nutrient that's commonly considered to be the      most important one is also the one that's hardest to      measure. Nitrogen's so variable depending on soil      conditions and so volatile once taken from the ground that      you really <em>can't</em> measure it except out in the      field."    </p>    <h3>      QUIT STALLING: WHICH TEST IS BEST?    </h3>    <p>      The principal conclusion we were able to draw from the      variety of results we got may sound like a cop-out on our      part, but we think it's actually quite important: <em>The      content of a soil test report depends on the philosophy of      the tester.</em> The two kit makers and the extension      service apparently hold to the chemical theory of      agriculture-the idea that the soil is little more      than a medium to hold the plants' roots, so you have to add      the specific chemicals that crops take out. Sudbury even      gives its results in terms of how much of each nutrient you      need to add . . . while the ag service people told us to      add nitrogen to the soil even though they admitted complete      ignorance of our soil's nitrogen levels! "Why?" we asked.      "Because you're growing vegetables," they replied.      (Incidentally, if you read our article "Preparing the Soil"      in MOTHER N0. 93, you'll know how to substitute organic      soil amendments for any recommended chemical ones.)    </p>    <p>      The people at Woods End seem to have a much more      open-minded outlook. Like our gardeners, they clearly have      an organic bias and are great believers in the virtues of      compost (see their recommendation in the chart). Yet Robert      Parties of Woods End told us they suggested compost partly      because we told them on our audit questionnaire that the      homemade amendment is our primary fertilizer. "If a      gardener indicates that he or she always uses 10-10-10-type      fertilizers, we'll give our advice in those terms. No sense      in recommending something that won't be used." They also      seem to run a surprisingly <em>tolerant</em> testing      service. While noting that some of our readings were a bit      off from ideal, their report doesn't suggest that such      variations are cause for concern-a conclusion that's'      bound to please anyone who doesn't think chemical analysis      is the final word on soil assessment.    </p>    <p>      Necessary Trading Company seems to be taking a      <em>refined</em> organic approach. As Steve Rioch said to      us, "You have good fertility. What I'm trying to do is      fine-tune your soil to help prevent pest outbreaks and      nutritional imbalances in your crops." In our case, at      least, such fine-tuning emphasized a balanced relationship      between nutrients. Indeed, the words <em>balance</em> and      <em>imbalance</em> appeared repeat edly in our report:      e.g., "Your pH is out of balance primarily because of an      imbalance between calcium, magnesium, and potassium."      Necessary also placed special emphasis on the importance of      calcium in the soil ("it may very well be the most      important of all soil and plant elements") and on cation      exchange capacity (and its balance). The latter refers to      the number of calcium, magnesium, and potassium ions in the      soil, ions that help the soil hold nutrients.    </p>    <h3>      "THE PERCENTAGE OF MILLIEQUIVALENTS OF THE RESERVE      VALUE INDEX . . ."    </h3>    <p>      Another distinction between the soil tests is how easy or      difficult they are for the gardener to understand and      follow. The worst report in this category was the one from      our agricultural extension service: It was clearly geared      to the commercial chemical farmer (or the closet chemist!)      and was quite intimidating. On the other hand, our local      agent was readily available to explain the results in lay      terms (and the test <em>was</em> free!).    </p>    <p>      The LaMotte and Sudbury size-ups were easier to understand      than the county ag's, and both companies provided useful      explanatory booklets about soil and fertilizers. (The kits      also give you the capability of repeating your tests more      than a dozen times.) LaMotte's literature was the more      complete of the two-and its kit a good bit easier to      use. It was also more sophisticated; some of the LaMotte      tests required twice as many steps as the equivalent      Sudbury ones.    </p>    <p>      The Woods End and Necessary reports were both a pleasure to      read. Woods End comes with a personal, down-to-earth      overview of the results. (Ours included the flattering      statement, "I hope you are not having problems with the      soil, because I would be hard put to offer any help.") The      full report was easy to digest and the enclosed discussion      of terms a definite help to anyone who ever slept through      part of chemistry class.    </p>    <p>      Necessary managed to provide the most thorough report of      all, while presenting its analysis in a clear and      understandable manner. Since its audit questionnaire was      also the most thorough-including questions on      predominant weeds and persistent bug problems-its      recommendation sheet covered areas the others didn't      address ("sprinkle diatomaceous earth for slugs"). The      additional three-page, detailed report explained the role      of each nutrient and the effect of any problem with our      levels. (Necessary also offers a 42page booklet, called      "What Makes My Garden Grow," with each test.)    </p>    <h3>      WHAT WE'LL DO    </h3>    <p>      So now that we've been blessed with an array of      agricultural assessments, just what are we going to do in      our garden? Well, if our comparisons make nothing else      clear, they certainly show that a soil test is just one      gardening tool, not <em>the</em> answer, so we'll combine      the data gleaned from the tests with our own experience      with the soil and the crops at the Eco-Village. And since      we're ardent organic growers who believe in cultivating      healthy soil first and foremost ("feed the soil, not the      plant," the saying goes), we'll give more weight ourselves      to the Woods End and Necessary reports. Susan Glaese, our      head gardener, says, "I figure our soil deserves about a      `three-star' rating. It's definitely not a 10-10-10      wasteland, but it's not growing Findhorn-size cabbages,      either. I agree with Necessary that our humus levels are      too low, but that's because in the past we've had to spread      our compost over 130 raised beds! I've made the garden      smaller now, so I should be able to use more compost in      each growing area. And I think I'll follow Necessary's      recommendations for increasing our calcium levels and      avoiding additional potassiumit'll be interesting to watch      the garden over the next year and see if such measures make      any difference in our crops."    </p>    <h3>      BUT WHAT SHOULD YOU DO?    </h3>    <p>      One thing for sure: <em>Don't</em> get five soil tests!      It's a bear to sort them all out . . . and hard to deal      with their contradictions. Instead, we'd recommend      that-if you choose to test your soil at all-you      pick the approach that suits your own gardening philosophy.      If (perish the thought) you'd like to sprinkle an N-P-K      formulation on your plot and be done with it, go with one      of the first three tests we used. If the organic approaches      of the "moderate" Woods End or "balancing" Necessary audits      sound like your cup of (manure) tea, pick one of      those-both companies were impressively helpful and      informative.    </p>    <p>      Most important, whichever test you pick, don't      automatically believe everything it tells you. Heck, even      professional soil testers will admit that what we      <em>don't</em> know about soil is a whole lot greater than      what we do. So let your own eyes, hands, and crops be the      final authorities on the state of <em>your</em> soil.    </p>    <h3>      Sizing Up Your Soil    </h3>    <p>      <em>Bill Wolf</em> <em>of</em> <em>Necessary Trading      Company gave us these suggestions for nonchemically      assessing the state</em> <em>of</em> <em>the soil:</em>    </p>    <p>      [1] Organic matter: <em>If your soil has a high humus      level, it should look dark and have an appealing "earthy"      smell.</em>    </p>    <p>      [2] Texture: <em>Roll</em> <em>a handful</em> <em>of</em>      <em>mediumdry soil into a ball. If it holds its shape,      you've got a substantial amount</em> <em>of</em> <em>clay      in your soil. . . and if you can further roll the ball into      a "sausage, " you've got a</em> lot <em>of</em> <em>clay.      If you can make scratches on the surface</em> <em>of</em>      <em>your clod, it's got a significant sand content, but if      it feels somewhat greasy in your hand, your soil's got a      fair amount of silt. If that handful crumbles when you try      to ball it up, your soil has a nice, balanced texture.</em>    </p>    <p>      [3] Root development: <em>Dig a hole two feet deep in your      garden and examine it to see where your plants' roots are.      If they're going down the full two feet, your soil is      fair</em> <em>ly friable. If they run lateral at some      point, though, you've got a compacted layer-plowpan      or hardpan-that needs to be broken up.</em>    </p>    <p>      [4] Drainage: <em>Now fill that hole with water. The liquid      should slowly percolate out into the surrounding soil. If      it stays pooled at any level, you have a drainage      problem.</em>    </p>    <p>      [5] Soil fauna: <em>Pick a day when your garden is somewhat      moist, dig up an exact 1'X 1'X 1' section</em> <em>of      soil,</em> <em>sift through this cubic foot, and count the      number of earthworms you find (they'll serve as      barometers</em> <em>of</em> <em>all kinds</em> <em>of      soil</em> <em>fauna). Ten or more is a good sign</em>      <em>of soil</em> <em>life; zero is terrible.</em>    </p>    <p>      [6] Nitrogen facing: <em>Dig up the roots</em> <em>of</em>      <em>some legumes-beans, peas, alfalfa,      clover-and examine them for nodules. Break a few of      those root lumps open. If they're fixing and storing      nitrogen as they should be, they'll be pink inside.</em>    </p>    <h3>      Talking Weeds    </h3>        <p>      Several garden weeds can give you indications of your      soil's condition:    </p>    <p>      Fertile soil: <em>lamb's-quarter, chicory, purslane,      burdock, and dandelion.</em><br />      Soil with low fertility: <em>fennel, sorrel, mayweed, and      chamomile.</em><br />      Soil with a crust or hardpan problem: <em>horse nettle,      morning glory, quack grass, chamomile, field mustard,      pineapple weed, and pennycress.</em><br />      Soil with poor drainage: <em>hedge bindweed, smartweed,      white avens.</em><br />      Acid soil: <em>dock, horsetail, hawkweed, sorrel, lady's      thumb.</em><br />      Salty soil: <em>sea plantain, sea aster, Russian thistle,      shepherd's purse.</em><br />    </p>    <h3>      "Seeing" Nutrient Deficiencies    </h3>    <p>      <em>We asked our friend Don North, an area nurseryman,      horticultural consultant, and native plant propagator, to      describe the common nutrient deficiency symptoms of garden      crops. Don told us that, in general, tomato plants are      especially good "deficiency meters" and then listed the      shortage symptoms he most often sees:</em>    </p>    <p>      Nitrogen: <em>Many deficiencies, including nitrogen, show      up as</em> chlorosis, <em>a yellowing of leaves. N      shortage, though, appears mostly in the</em> older      <em>leaves (the young ones hog the available nitrogen) at      the bottom of the plant. These yellow and</em> "fire"      <em>(get a burnt look). The entire plant may also be      stunted.</em>    </p>    <p>      Iron: <em>The veins keep their green color in      iron-deficient plants, but the</em> rest <em>of the leaves      yellow or turn light green. (Don's remedy? Iron      chelate.)</em>    </p>    <p>      Sulfur: <em>In this case, the</em> young <em>leaves      (including veins) turn chlorotic.</em>    </p>    <p>      Potassium: <em>K-short crops exhibit yellow</em> streaking,      <em>along with curling, mottling, or spotting of older      leaves. The plants are often particularly      disease-susceptible.</em>    </p>    <p>      Phosphorus: <em>Plants low in phosphorus are often small,      have very dark green or bluish foliage, and red or purplish      veins. Poor fruit development is another indication of P      deprivation.</em>    </p>    <p>      Calcium: <em>The classic sign of calcium deficiency in      tomatoes is blossom-end rot. Other symptoms are hard to      spot: Young leaves and terminal buds may become hooked in      appearance or die back at their tops, or the young leaves      may remain folded or look wrinkled. (Don recommends Viking      brand calcium nitrate-from Norway-for both      calcium and nitrogen shortages: "It's one of the best      fertilizers around. ")</em>    </p>    <p>      Boron: <em>If</em> <em>your broccoli and cauliflower stems      are soft and brown in the center, your soil's got a boron      deficiency.</em>    </p>    <p>      Soil Test Results for Mother's Eco-Village Garden    </p>
