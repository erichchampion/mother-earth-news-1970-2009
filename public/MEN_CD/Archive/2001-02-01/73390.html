                    <p>      Why is the EPA gambling with our health?    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Marguerite Lamb    </h5>            <p>      Under the law, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)      was to have finished a third of the job by August 1999,      giving priority to the riskiest pesticides, including 45      organophosphates (OPs), highly effective poisons that kill      by inhibiting an enzyme necessary for proper nervous system      function. (Some of the more potent organophosphates were      used as nerve gases in World War II.) But so far reviews      have been finalized for only eight of the OPs; of these,      seven have had their registrations canceled and their      tolerances, or legal residue limits, revoked.    </p>    <p>      Reviews for the remaining 37 OPs are now stalled while the      EPA figures out how to measure these pesticides' combined      risk to human health (as required under the FQPA).      Historically, the EPA has assessed each OP as a discrete      poison; yet, as nerve agents, all OPs act similarly on the      body and their effects are cumulative. Acute exposures can      cause symptoms ranging from dizziness, vomiting and      headaches to respiratory arrest, convulsions and death.      Chronic low-dose exposures have been linked to      nervous-system damage, learning disabilities, cancer,      fertility problems and birth defects.    </p>    <p>      Despite the missed '99 deadline, Jack Housenger, associate      director of the EPA's special review and reregistration      division, insists the OP reassessments are on track. True,      most have gone as far as they can go pending a means for      calculating the dangers of combined exposures (the EPA has      pledged to have a formula in place before this summer).      Meanwhile, the discrete, or individual, risk assessments      have been updated for nearly all of the organophosphates,      and interim decisions reauthorizing, amending or canceling      existing uses have been issued for more than a dozen. But      even as the agency trumpets its midstream reductions of      these controversial pesticides, critics contend the      restrictions don't go nearly far enough.    </p>    <h3>      COZY WITH INDUSTRY    </h3>    <p>      Last summer, when the EPA announced a ban on the pesticide      chlorpyrifos (trade name Dursban) for most home and garden      uses it seemed a triumph for public health advocates, who      had long questioned the safety of this most widely used      organophos phate. Upon closer inspection, however, the      decision turns out to be a qualified win at best.      Chlorpyrifos - a poison that in animal studies has proven      hazardous to developing brains and nervous systems - will      still be used agriculturally, though not on the too      permeable tomato. Some 13 million pounds will continue to      be applied annually to corn, grain, fruits, nuts and      vegetables. The decision also tem porarily retains Dursban      as a termite con trol, allowing spot and local treatments      of postconstruction lumber through 2002 and of      preconstruction materials through 2005. Use on golf courses      and for mosquito sprayings will continue indefinitely.      Indeed, Housenger admits an all-out ban is unlikely.    </p>        <p>      Jay Feldman, executive director of Beyond      Pesticides/National Coalition Against the Misuse of      Pesticides, a Washington, D.C.-based environmental      consortium, counters that anything short of a cancellation      is unacceptable. "Our position is that the public should      not be exposed to neurotoxic pesticides," says Feldman, who      faults the EPA for "regulating by negotiation" with the      chemical industry - striking deals that put company profit      above public safety. He points specifically to      chlorpyrifos, and charges that the EPA worked with Dow      Agrosciences, the makers of Dursban, to determine which      uses would stay and which would go.    </p>    <p>      Housenger confirms that the chlorpyrifos restrictions were      hammered out in meetings with Dow, but maintains such      negotiations serve the public good by preventing lengthy      litigation and by speeding removal of dangerous products      from the market.    </p>    <p>      But while the agreement may mean less work for EPA lawyers,      it hardly signals a quick exit for chlorpyrifos. Dow was      allowed to keep making Dursban through last December, and      retailers may continue selling products containing the      pesticide through 2001 - with no obligation to warn      consumers that its home-use days are numbered. Moreover,      chlorpyrifos products purchased on or before December 31      can legally be used until supplies are exhausted.    </p>    <p>      Housenger defends the long phase-out period, noting that      federal law bars the EPA from issuing a pesticide recall      except in cases of an emergency suspension. "In order to      suspend, we have to deem that there is an imminent hazard,"      says Housenger, "which is a whole different standard than      showing that cancellation is warranted." Besides, he adds,      a recall has its own worries: "There's risk in getting the      product back up-line - and then there is the issue of      disposing of a lot of this product when it is all      accumulated in one place." Given the choices, says      Housenger, the EPA "thought it best" to allow chlorpyrifos      to dissipate in the marketplace.    </p>    <h3>      VESTED INTEREST    </h3>    <p>      Dow Agrosciences' involvement in the reassessment of      chlorpyrifos is hardly an anomaly. Indeed, the chemical      industry is involved in every step of the pesticide      registration and tolerance-setting process. Here's how it      works: The manufacturer, or "registrant" (i.e., Dow), tells      the EPA how much pesticide residue is likely to remain on      crops based on company test-sprayings. It either conducts      or contracts out federally required toxicity tests to      determine if its product may cause cancer, birth defects or      other health hazards. The results are submitted to EPA      scientists, who analyze the data and draft a preliminary      risk assessment. That draft is then bounced back to the man      ufacturer for a 30-day review period, during which, accord      ing to Housenger, the company can "comment on [the EPA's]      risk assessment and provide corrections to it."    </p>    <p>      I n the case of the widely used organophosphate malathion      this back-and-forthing resulted in a substantial lowering      of the pesticide's cancer rating. A team of EPA scientists,      headed by senior toxicologist Brian Dementi, analyzed the      health data provided by ChemiNova, malathion's      manufacturer, and concluded that the chemical causes liver      tumors in lab animals. The team presented its findings to      the EPA's cancer review committee, which deemed malathion a      "likely human carcinogen." Dissatisfied with this      interpretation, ChemiNova convened a panel of pathologists      to reexamine the data and draw its own conclusions.      According to Dementi, the panel "severely, remarkably      downgraded the initial [tumorogenic] findings," prompting      the EPA's cancer committee to change its malathion ruling      from "likely human carcinogen" to "suggestive evidence of      carcinogenicity."    </p>    <p>      The change is not trivial. For likely carcinogens, the EPA      must perform quantitative risk assessments and impose      regulations accordingly. Alternatively, where there is      merely suggestive evidence of a carcinogen, the agency can      dismiss the danger as insignificant.    </p>    <p>      Dementi has questioned the outside panel's findings before      the EPA's cancer review committee and its Scientific      Advisory Panel (SAP), but so far, he says, his concerns      have "fallen on deaf ears." Meanwhile, a revised      preliminary risk assessment was released for public comment      last May, indicating that there was "insufficient evidence      to assess the potential [of malathion] for causing cancer      in humans."    </p>    <p>      Among the more common organophosphates, malathion is used      on nearly 100 food and fiber crops. It is the third most      frequently detected pesticide in our food supply, showing      up in about 17% of items tested by the Food and Drug      Administration (see " Hidden Ingredients "). It is also      regularly used for pest control and in aerial sprayings to      combat mosquitoes, as in the well-known 1999-2000 spraying      over New York City to combat the West Nile Virus.    </p>    <h3>      A CALL TO ARMS    </h3>    <p>      Frustrated by the EPA's lethargic (and arguably      compromised) review efforts, NCAMP's Feldman fumes that      "The EPA has failed so badly in the pesticide arena that it      is hard to envision the agency... ever adequately      protecting the public."    </p>    <p>      Indeed, a full five years after the passage of FQPA and      eight years after the initial NAS report that prompted it,      OPs continue to account for roughly half of the pesticides      sold in America. Some 60 million pounds are applied      annually to 60 million acres of U.S. cropland, while      another 17 million pounds go to insect control as well as      home lawn and garden care.    </p>    <p>      With the EPA hobbled by inefficiencies and questionable      alliances, say Feldman and others, the onus is on      individuals to protect themselves. First, know what you're      eating (see " What's Used Where ," below). Second, petition      your congressmen and the EPA for a universal ban on      organophosphate pesticides. For more information, contact      the EPA's Office of Pesticide Programs is at (703) 308-8000      or write to U.S. EPA, Office of Pesticide Programs (7508C),      Ariel Rios Building, 1200 Pennsylvania Ave., NW,      Washington, D.C. 20460.    </p>    <p>      Finally, use your cash to support organic agriculture. So      long as the EPA snuggles up to the chemical giants, it's up      to consumers to keep the giants out of the kitchen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>What's Used Where</strong>    </p>    <p>      Education is key to protecting yourself from unwanted      pesticides. Here are a few Web sites to check out:<br />      • <strong>FoodNews.org</strong> <em>( www.foodnews.org      )</em> by the Environmental Working Group calculates      pesticide content and attendant health risks for selected      foods.<br />      • <strong>The Pesticide Action Network Pesticide      Database</strong> ( www.pesticideinfo.org ) offers      information on 100,000 formulated pesticide products.<br />      • <strong>EPA Office of Pesticide Programs</strong> (      www.epa.gov/pesticides/food/viewtols.htm ) tell which      pesticides are approved, and in what amounts, for use on      your favorite foods.    </p>    <p>      Related info:<br />      Banned ... but not till it's gone<br />      Hidden Ingredients    </p>
