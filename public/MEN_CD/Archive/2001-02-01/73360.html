        <p>Northland's has long had a strong Environmental emphasis in its curriculum so when a housing shortage became problematic, students, staff and members of the community con verged to plan a residence hall in keeping with the college's integrity. "It fits our mission and meets the strong interest of the students," says Tom Wojciechovski, director of student development.</p><p>With three photovoltaic arrays (totaling 45 individual solar panels), two composting toilets and two greenhouses, the $1.4 million building has set a precedent for Northland, which will incorporate some of the dorm's more favorable green features in future building projects. Northland is planning to build a new student center within the next year that will utilize daylighting to cut down on the use of artificial lights, waterless urinals and lowflow toilets, sustainably-harvested hardwoods and recycled (and recyclable) carpeting from companies such as Atlanta-based Interface.</p><p>According to Wojciechovski, the educational value of the dorm outweighs the economic payback. Nonetheless, he estimates the efficiency of the building will probably save the campus about $10,000 this year in operating cost.</p><p><em>- Monica J. Smith</em></p>
