                        <p>      Of all the methods devised to support tomato plants,      nothing compares to homemade, solid, woven-wire towers.    </p>    <p>      1 Start with a roll of 4" x 4" or 6" x 6" woven wire      fencing. Anything smaller than 4" x 4" makes it difficult      to reach through the wires to harvest ripe fruit. Woven      wire comes in widths ranging from 40" to 5' high: Get the      widest you can find. Some garden centers sell fencing whose      openings increase in size as they move upwards. That is,      they start out with a row or two of openings measuring 2" x      4" then enlarge to 4" x 4" and eventually reaching as big      as 6" x 8". Making towers with this size mesh is more time      consuming, but it actually makes a more durable structure.    </p>    <p>      2 Cut a section 4' long with the end wires on one side      sticking out without a vertical wire. Bend these wires into      open hooks, about 1" long.    </p>    <p>      3 Roll the wire into a cylinder and use the hooks to grab      the vertical wire on the far end. Then squeeze the hooks      closed with pliers. That's all it takes.    </p>    <p>      To anchor the tower there are two options: You can cut the      bottom horizontal wire off, which will provide the tower      with 8 to 12 legs, 4" to 6" long. Merely push these into      the ground and they will hold most plants with no danger of      falling. If you use wire that increases in mesh size from      bottom to top, this method will not work because the legs      will be only 2" long - not enough to stabilize the tower.    </p>    <p>      Alternately, you can either stake or pin the tower in      place. To pin it, bend heavy-duty wire, such as from a coat      hanger, into a hairpin shape that's at least 6" long. Use      three or four of these to anchor the tower in place.    </p>    <p>      For tomatoes, anchor the tower in place as soon as you      transplant the seedlings. That way, none of the branches      will grow too big before you get the support in place. Keep      the seedling as centered as possible.    </p>        <p>      Tomato towers are useful for other plants as well. You can,      for instance, plant a ring of pea seeds around an anchored      tower, then train them to grow up the wire. This method      works best with shorter-vined varieties. For longer vines,      a trellis or A-frame support makes more sense.    </p>
