                    <p>      For those of you who come across baby birds that have      fallen from their nests and fear for the baby's life, I      have an answer. We all know it's best to leave fledglings      alone (as their parents will tend to them on the ground,      eventually), but if you have cats or other predatory or      curious pets around, the baby birds will be in danger. The      answer? Save old birds' nests that you've found and place      the fledgling in the nest out of harm's way. It's best if      you can find the tree you think the baby fell out of. If      you don't have an old nest, try a brown paper sack,      sandwich-sized, filled with dry material. Then sit back and      wait for the parents to return knowing you've done the most      you could with the least interference your heart and      conscience would allow.    </p>    <p>      DIANE HENDRICKS<br />      East Wenatchee, Washington    </p>
