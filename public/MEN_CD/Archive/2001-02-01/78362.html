                        <p>      Even when the EPA negotiates a partial or total pesticide      ban, it can be years before foods containing the chemical      clear store shelves.    </p>    <p>      Written into the 1996 Food Quality and Protection Act      (FQPA) is a "channels of trade" provision, which assures      that, in the event of a ban, producers are not left holding      the bag. The provision permits foods containing a canceled      pesticide to stay on the market, so long as the chemical      was appropriately applied prior to the ban. The clause is      particularly relevant for certain frozen, dried and canned      foods, which can take up to four years to reach your dinner      plate. FDA Risk Assessment Chief Michael Bolger says the      provision was intended to prevent a "major disruption of      the food supply" and will proceed save "evidence of an      acute imminent public health hazard."    </p>    <p>      "The best way to clear out what is in the channels of trade      is for it to be used up," adds EPA's Jack Housenger,      insisting that the FQPA provision is "necessary for the      orderly transition to safer alternatives."<br />    </p>
