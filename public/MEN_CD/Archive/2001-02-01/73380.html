                    <p>      <em>Solar power, utilities and the beauty of a backwards      spinning meter.</em>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by Richard Carnes    </h5>            <p>      So with the country dangling on a thin wire between      formidable possibilities, my wife and I decided to proceed      with the next logical step: Build an addition onto the      house.    </p>    <p>      We live roughly 7,500 feet above sea level in the Rocky      Mountains, which means that our proximity to the sun's      powerful rays, as well as our electric bills, are skyhigh.      I had always been interested in solar power, and since we      would be constructing a new roof anyway here was an      opportunity to install solar panels on our house.    </p>    <p>      Most small towns do not usually have a listing for "solar      energy," so the first (and only) place we began looking was      the Internet. Typing in the ambiguous to term "solar panel"      brought 88,126 possible hits.    </p>    <p>      "Solar panel installation" narrowed it down to a mere      3,489, while "solar panel installation Colorado" tapered      the listing to a workable 212. What a pleasant surprise it      was to find listed on the very first page, no less - the      Solar Energy Institute (SEI) of Carbondale, Colorado, a      mere hop, skip and a jump over one mountain pass from our      home in the Vail Valley.    </p>    <p>      The word "Institute" alarmed me a bit. I was convinced I      would be talking to a group of scientists and listening to      hours of brain draining solarbabble. But what (or who) I      found instead was Ed.    </p>    <p>      Ed is a soft-spoken, gentle, articulate individual who      seemed genuinely interested in answering my simpleminded      ("What does PV stand for?") questions. We spent more than      half an hour on the phone, and Ed followed up the next day      via e-mail. I stumbled upon no less than one of the world's      most prestigious schools for studying and exploring the      possibilities of solar power.    </p>    <p>      The first real hurdle we had to clear was determining what      type of system we really needed. Our so-called secluded      community high up in the Rockies includes 5,000 other      let's-get-away-from-it-all souls, so it's not as if we were      off the power grid. Therefore, a line-tied system made      perfect sense. This type of solar system would allow us to      install our very own miniature power plant on the roof,      with the option of selling the excess generated power back      to the utility company via the grid.    </p>    <p>      It was a perfect arrangement, but it still required a bit      of planning . As an uncle of mine used to say, "Don't jump      off a diving board wearing a bikini." That is, be pre pared      for the unexpected.<br />    </p>    <p>      Utility companies make their money one very simple way: by      generating energy and then selling it to customers. Why in      the world would they want to buy it from <em>me?</em>      Wouldn't I be a <em>competitor?</em>    </p>    <p>      Yet lo and behold, within a few weeks, Ed had a completed      form direct from Holy Cross Electric giving their blessing,      so to speak, to our planned event. Without waiting another      second, we provided the initial deposit and set a      construction date.    </p>        <p>      Being a school, SEI saved us a great deal of money by using      our house as a class project. Of course, the thought of a      first-year college student poking large holes in my roof      came immediately to mind, but Ed and his staff quickly put      those fears to rest.    </p>    <p>      "Our school is comprised of top-notch individuals from all      over the world who have one common goal: to learn about and      spread the knowledge of solar energy around the planet. Our      students range from an 18-year-old science nerd already in      his third year of college to a 63-year-old retired      electrical engineer interested in bringing solar      capabilities to decaying areas of Africa."    </p>    <p>      To top it off, these "students" were paying hefty fees for      the privilege of learning the advantages of solar energy      and how to apply them to the real world. These ladies and      gentlemen were the real thing - goodhearted souls with a      burning desire to help change the world.    </p>    <p>      Two weeks later, 21 students prepared to spend the next      three days turning our simple shingled roof into a      3,000-watt lethal, but legal, power plant.    </p>    <p>      Day one was full of prep work. Dozens of large holes were      drilled in the roof. Seemingly miles of wires were      channeled down through well-placed tubing, all culminating      at a predetermined location in the corner of our garage.    </p>    <p>      Day two was reserved for the crane truck, which took up all      of our driveway and half of the street just to get      stabilized. Hoisting eight $2,500 panels 75 feet in the air      on a windy day was not an easy sight for the weak (or      thrifty) to see, but this was a commitment we had made as a      family. Damage from falling debris or unbalanced cranes was      something for insurance companies to worry about, not us.    </p>    <p>      Day three was the climax. Hour upon hour was spent      connecting hundreds of different wires, while a container      to hold nine deep-cell batteries was placed in the garage.      After what seemed like a lifetime of repetitive testing on      gauges and other equipment the moment of truth arrived.    </p>    <p>      All of the students, teachers, family members, and even a      few neighbors gathered at ground zero in the garage. Ed      gave a short but eloquent speech, outlining what had taken      place over the previous three days. One student held the      cork down on a bottle of champagne, waiting for the precise      moment, while the others giggled like schoolchildren      waiting for the bell to ring. My family and I stood      proudly, our hearts pumping with anticipation at the first      generxated watt.    </p>        <p>      Hoisting eight $2,500 panels 75 feet in the air on a windy      day was not a sight for the weak (or thrifty) to watch    </p>    <p>      Ed reached over and flipped the big switch labeled "A".    </p>    <p>      And nothing happened. No bells, no whistles, no alarms, no      power producing sounds whatsoever.    </p>    <p>      Ed's smile grew from ear to ear as the rest of the class      let go with a tremendous "Hip-hip, hooray!"    </p>    <p>      We just stood there dumbfounded. What was happening? Why      was everybody so damn happy? Had we just spent a great deal      of money for nothing?    </p>    <p>      "Perfect," Ed said, calmly. He began p ushing buttons on      the miniature screen that was part of our AC/DC inverter on      the garage wall.    </p>    <p>      "Perfect? Nothing's happening. How can you say it's      perfect?" I asked politely, but with an edge of uncertainty      that Ed had seen through from the beginning.    </p>    <p>      "That's exactly what it's <em>supposed</em> to do," he      replied. "No sounds, except maybe for the cooling fan      inside the inverter. Look here, see these numbers? Well,      this one tells you how many amps you're currently creating,      while this one..."    </p>    <p>      And he continued for the next few minutes. I stared in awe      but listened with great intent as he explained what was      silently taking place upon my roof. It was not only working      perfectly, but their experiment with an extra battery (nine      instead of the standard eight) was adding to our total      capabilities as they had hoped.    </p>    <p>      "Do you want to see it <em>really</em> working?" Ed asked      the crowd.    </p>    <p>      We responded enthusiastically, and Ed quickly walked out of      the garage and down to the street. My family and the rest      rushed to follow, not really sure what we were about to      witness. The sun was burning bright on a typical 75'F July      afternoon in the Rockies.    </p>    <p>      "Take a look at your electric meter. Then go across the      street and look at your neighbor's meter."    </p>    <p>      I did as I was told and quickly returned, only this time      the big smile was all mine.    </p>    <p>      "Ours is spinning <em>backwards!"</em>    </p>    <p>      And it was, which of course meant that our batteries were      fully charged and that every extra ounce of amp our little      power plant created was being sent back to the utility      company. We were literally watching the solar panels pay      for themselves right before our very eyes.    </p>    <p>      "Payback" in a PV system is a complicated proposition.      Technically, we began to save most of our nearly $200      monthly electric bill as soon as we threw the switch. At a      savings rate of, say, $150 a month, it would take 18 years      for the system cost to find its way back to us. That      assumes, of course, a static cost for utility power, and      the millions who have endured a 100% increase in grid power      cost just this year will strenuously argue that assumption.    </p>    <p>      So, with smiles all around, we quickly downed the lone      bottle of champagne and broke out the beer and hot dogs.      The sun would do the rest.    </p>
