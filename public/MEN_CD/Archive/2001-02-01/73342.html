                    <p>      Sprouts are amazing little storehouses of nutrition - and      they taste great in salads and on sandwiches. They are very      simple to grow indoors, but anyone who gardens probably has      access to plenty of sprouts already. Many of the thinnings      we glean from newly sprouted plots - including radish,      arugula, lettuce, mustard, collards, beets, basil, dill,      clover, spinach, sunflowers and many more - are edible and      delicious. (Favas, tomatoes, limas and eggplant are among      the nonedibles.) Many of the sprouts taste similar to the      mature plants, and all add a lively addition to meals. You      will also discover tiny sprout gardens at the bases of      plants that have dropped their seed or where plants dropped      seeds the previous season - amaranth, quinoa, sunflower,      arugula, dill and mustard are among the best for this. So      next time you weed the garden, don't throw those tiny      thinnings in the compost bin - put them in the salad bowl!    </p>    <p>      SUSAN GRELOCK<br />      Ash Fork, Arizona    </p>
