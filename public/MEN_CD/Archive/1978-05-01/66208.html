                <h5 id="byline">by Kathryn Hannaford</h5>    <p>      From <em>Cosmic Cookery</em> by Kathryn Hannaford,      copyright 1974 by Starmast Publications, 345 W. Clay St.      Stockton, Calif. 95206. Reprinted by permission. This book      is available in paperback ($5.95) from the publisher or      from any good bookstore.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>In 1974, Kathryn Hannaford of Stockton, California      published Cosmic Cookery . . . a book of protein-balanced      recipes that called for no eggs, fish, fowl, or meat. The      book was written, she said, not only "for beginners in      natural foods cooking, who know little about the endless      combinations of nature's delights and the many ways to      prepare them" . . . but also "for the experienced      vegetarian who's looking for new ideas and      inspiration".</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>Well,</em> Cosmic Cookery- <em>now in its third      printing-does indeed provide both information and      inspiration aplenty . . . and as proof of that we offer you      Kathryn's suggestions on salads.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>California-more than any other state in the      Union-is known for its wonderful, inventive salads.      But it doesn't matter where you live: Anyone armed with the      following secrets can prepare an unlimited variety of      beautiful, tempting, California-style salads.</em>    </p>    <p>      To most people, the idea of a salad with a meal means a few      tossed lettuce leaves and tomato wedges . . . with maybe      some sliced radishes for added color. But-when you      become aware of the varieties of available vegetation that      can be used to make really superb salads-you'll give      that part of the meal more prominence on your table . . .      and perhaps even make the salad course the most colorful      and tasty part of your whole lunch or dinner. The following      is only a partial list of the many exciting vegetables that      can be used in salads.    </p>        <p>      <strong>ASPARAGUS:</strong> The tender, sweet tips can be eaten raw or (as      the stalks should be) cooked until they're barely done.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEET GREENS:</strong> Wash leaves well and cut into      bite-sized pieces. High in vitamin C.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BEETS:</strong> Scrub well with a vegetable brush,      dry, and grate. Very sweet and juicy this way. High in      iron.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BELL PEPPER:</strong> Remove the inner core, seeds,      and membrane and slice into julienne strips, or garnish      your salad with pepper rings.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BERMUDA ONION:</strong> These mild red onions make      colorful salad decorations when cut into thin rings. The      rings may be marinated and served alone or added to bean      salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BOK CHOY:</strong> Both the green leaves and the      white, bulbous base can be chopped and used.    </p>    <p>      <strong>BROCCOLI:</strong> All parts of this colorful green      flowering vegetable can be added to salads. Cut the      flowerets, leafy greens, and stems into very small pieces.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CABBAGE, GREEN:</strong> This slightly      sulfurous-tasting vegetable is at its best when grated or      shredded to release its juices.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CABBAGE, RED:</strong> Prepare in the same ways as      green cabbage. Nice for color.<br />    </p>    <p>      <strong>CARROTS:</strong> Shred the bright orange root      finely to release juice, and mince the ferny green tops.      High in vitamin A.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CAULIFLOWER:</strong> Use raw, and cut into small,      bite-sized flowerets. The edible leaves surrounding the      base of the head can be eaten like collard greens . and may      also be chopped and used raw in salads, or set aside to be      eaten later as steamed greens.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CELERY:</strong> Slice the long stalks diagonally,      or chop or mince them. The tender, sweet inner leaves      enhance any salad, but avoid using the bitter outer leaves.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHARD, RHUBARB:</strong> The broad, dark-green      leaves and rich-red stalks may be finely cut and added      sparingly to salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHARD, SWISS:</strong> This is the same as rhubarb,      with the exception of its flat white stalks. Follow the      procedure for rhubarb chard.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CHINESE CABBAGE:</strong> This juicy relative of      the cabbage has long broad leaves with curly edges, which      are delicious-chopped-as a salad green. Wash      the leaves carefully.    </p>    <p>      <strong>CLOVER:</strong> There's a tangy, sour taste to      this well-known field grass. Use both the stems and the      leaves in salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>COLLARDS:</strong> The leaves should be washed      carefully and chopped finely. They're also delicious served      steamed with lemon juice.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CUCUMBER:</strong> A sweet, meaty vegetable, traditionally sliced in      rounds. Peel the skin if it tastes bitter or shows evidence      of having been waxed.    </p>    <p>      <strong>DANDELION GREENS:</strong> Though slightly bitter,      these wild greens are very tasty . . . especially while      still young and tender. Wash them well and use them      sparingly for flavor ac cents. Try marinating them for an      additional treat.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ENDIVE</strong> and <strong>ESCAROLE:</strong>      Similar types of curly, loose-leaf lettuce with a slightly      bitter flavor. Wash and chop, and add sparingly to other      lettuces. They lend an interesting texture to salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>FENNEL (ANISE):</strong> The bulbous white root and      green leaves taste like licorice, and are delicious raw.      Wash and chop to garnish a salad. Use sparingly at first.    </p>    <p>      <strong>GARLIC:</strong> This famous pungent bulb contains      small cloves which can be peeled and then rubbed around the      interior of the salad bowl-before the ingredients are      added-for extra flavor zest.    </p>    <p>      <strong>KOHLRABI:</strong> Similar to the turnip, but grows      above ground. The bulky part must be pared, then grated or      thinly sliced.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LEEKS:</strong> A type of onion similar to      scallions, only sweeter and much larger. These should be      washed very thoroughly, then chopped finely.    </p>        <p>      <strong>LETTUCE, BUTTER:</strong> Known in many parts of the country as      Boston lettuce, these small, sweet heads of light-green to      yellow leaflets must be washed carefully and torn by hand.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LETTUCE, HEAD:</strong> Also called iceberg      lettuce. Wash briefly, then remove the wilted outer leaves      and save them for soup stock Chop, tear, or shred the      crisp, firm head.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LETTUCE, RED LEAF:</strong> These loose heads are      composed of sweet, tender leaves with curly, reddish tips.      They, like butter lettuce, should be washed carefully and      hand torn.    </p>    <p>      <strong>LETTUCE, ROMAINE:</strong> Has long, crisp leaves      with crunchy spines that-chopped or torn-add      body to a salad.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MINT:</strong> A delicious common garden plant with      a refreshing flavor. Wash the leaves and chop a few into      your salads, or mince some to add a new zing to salad      dressing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSHROOMS:</strong> Their delicate flavor and meaty      flesh are welcome in any salad. Slice them lengthwise to      show their pretty shape.    </p>    <p>      <strong>MUSTARD GREENS:</strong> These are long, tightly      curled leaves with a hot, tangy flavor. Wash them well and      use them sparingly for their piquancy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>NASTURTIUM:</strong> Both the leaves and the buds      of this flower can be used.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PARSNIPS:</strong> Similar to turnips, only they      have a more slender bulb. Wash and grate them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>PEAS, FRESH GREEN:</strong> Choose small pods with      firm, tender, young peas. Remove the peas from the pods and      add them-raw-to your salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RADISHES:</strong> Wash them, trim off the ends,      and either leave them whole (to be scored into decorative      "rosebuds") or slice them thinly . . . to add a crisp,      tangy taste to the salad course.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RUTABAGA:</strong> Also called Swedes or Swedish      turnips, these large vegetables are related to turnips and      parsnips. The round, firm, meaty flesh is best sliced      paper-thin or grated.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SCALLIONS:</strong> These are of the onion family,      but much smaller than their relatives the leeks. Trim the      roots from the white bulbs, and slice off the opposite ends      where the shoots are greenest, then wash them and thinly      chop or finely mince them.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOUR GRASS:</strong> The children find this tasty      sour stem and small yellow blossom growing in fields, and      bring it home for our salads. Wash and chop the whole      thing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SPINACH:</strong> Its spear-shaped dark-green      leaves and stems are slightly astringent but have a deep,      rich flavor. Wash each leaf separately, as they tend to be      gritty, then tear or slice it into pieces.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SPROUTS:</strong> These are indispensable in salads. Many beans and      seeds can be sprouted inexpensively at home to add      tremendous nutrition to your raw salads. We've had success      with lentil, soybean, garbanzo bean, mung bean, adzuki      bean, and alfalfa seed sprouts in our own kitchen.    </p>    <p>      <strong>TOMATOES:</strong> Use small, whole cherry      tomatoes, or slice larger tomatoes into bite-sized      sections.    </p>    <p>      <strong>WATERCRESS:</strong> This plant is found growing in      shallow brooks. Its dark-green, shiny leaves and crisp      stems contribute a fresh, peppery taste to salads.    </p>    <p>      <strong>ZUCCHINI:</strong> Use this delicate green squash      while it's still quite firm and before it grows larger than      medium-sized. Wash it and cut it-peel and      all-into thin rounds or matchstick pieces.    </p>    <p>      Now that you've expanded (I hope) your conception of what      can go into a salad, here are some ideas on how to "put it      all together".    </p>    <h3>      BEET SLAW    </h3>    <p>      1 cup raw grated beet, unpeeled but scrubbed well<br />      2 cups grated carrot or shredded cabbage (or one cup of      each) salt to taste<br />      Lemon-Honey Dressing (recipe to follow)    </p>    <p>      Mix the vegetable ingredients together and toss them with      the salt, then serve with the dressing. As a variation, add      1/2 cup currants and 1/2 cup chopped walnuts. Serves      six.    </p>        <h3>      MARINATED TOMATO SALAD    </h3>    <p>      4 sliced tomatoes<br />      3/4 cup oil<br />      3 tablespoons vinegar<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons sea salt<br />      1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br />      a dash of dry mustard    </p>    <p>      Marinate the tomato slices in a mixture of all the other      ingredients for two to three hours. Drain and serve on a      bed of lettuce or watercress. Serves six to eight.    </p>    <h3>      DATE WALDORF SALAD    </h3>    <p>      1 cup diced celery<br />      1 cup apple, cored and diced<br />      1/2 cup chopped walnuts<br />      1/2 cup chopped dates<br />      1 cup Sweet Soy Mayonnaise Dressing (recipe to follow)    </p>    <p>      Mix all ingredients well, and chill before serving. Serves      six.    </p>    <h3>      CARROT-DATE-CABBAGE SLAW    </h3>    <p>      2 cups minced carrot<br />      2 cups minced cabbage<br />      1/2 cup dates, pitted and finely chopped<br />      1/2 cup raw sunflower seeds<br />      1 cup Sweet Soy Mayonnaise Dressing (recipe to      follow)<br />      4 green bell peppers    </p>    <p>      Gently mix all ingredients . . . don't overmix. Stuff into      the raw bell pepper shells (from which you've removed all      the seeds and membranes). Serves four.    </p>    <h3>      COLE SLAW    </h3>    <p>      1 head of green cabbage sea salt and freshly ground black      pepper to taste<br />      3/4 cup lemon juice<br />      1-2 teaspoons honey<br />      3/4 cup oil<br />      sesame salt to taste (recipe to follow)    </p>    <p>      Shred the cabbage as finely as possible to release most of      the juices (which is so important if you want to make the      best tasting cole slaw). A good shredding method is to cut      the cabbage head in quarters-lengthwise from the core      to the top-and remove the core. Then shred lengthwise      with a very sharp knife . . . as thinly as possible.      Sprinkle the shredded cabbage with salt and pepper. Blend      the lemon juice, honey, and oil, and pour this dressing      over the slaw. Toss well, and add sesame salt upon serving.    </p>    <p>      As a variation, use red cabbage and add 2/3 cup of white      seedless raisins. Or add one cup of grated apple for each      cup of green cabbage, and dress with Yogurt Dressing      (recipe to follow). Yields six to eight cups.    </p>    <h3>      CARROT RAISIN SALAD    </h3>    <p>      2 cups grated carrot<br />      1/2 cup raisins or currants<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1/4 cup oil<br />      3/8 cup lemon juice (or slightly more or less, to your      taste)    </p>    <p>      Mix the carrot and raisins together, then combine the      liquid ingredients and toss them with the carrot/raisin      mixture. As a variation, use 1/4 cup lemon juice and 1/8      cup orange juice rather than all lemon juice, or add two      cups of grated apple to the salad Serves three.    </p>        <h3>      LEMON-HONEY DRESSING    </h3>    <p>      1/2 cup oil<br />      1/2 cup lemon juice<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons honey    </p>    <p>      Pour all the ingredients into a glass jar, screw on the      lid, and shake well.    </p>    <h3>      SWEET SOY MAYONNAISE DRESSING    </h3>    <p>      1 cup soy milk powder (one commercial brand is Fearn      Natural Soya Powder, made by Richard Foods Corporation in      Melrose Park, Illinois and sold at many health food      stores)<br />      2 cups water<br />      1/4 cup vinegar<br />      1/4 cup honey<br />      1-1/2 teaspoons sea salt oil as needed<br />      1 tablespoon lemon juice honey to taste<br />      1 cup yogurt a dash of cinnamon    </p>        <p>      Whisk together the soy milk powder and water in the top of      a double boiler, and double boil for 20 minutes on      medium-high heat, stirring frequently so that the mixture      will be smooth. Place it in the refrigerator to cool.    </p>    <p>      Next, blend together the vinegar, honey, and salt, and pour      the liquid into a temporary container. Now put enough oil      into the blender to cover the blades, turn on the machine      at medium-low speed, and gradually add to the oil three to      four tablespoons of the cooled soy milk, until the mixture      thickens and the blades no longer turn easily. Add three to      four tablespoons of the vinegar mixture, <em>very</em>      <em>carefully</em> aiding the blending process with a      spatula.    </p>    <p>      Use the spatula to turn the mayonnaise from the blender      into a bowl, and repeat the entire process (starting with      the oil) until all of the vinegar mixture has been used.      (If there's any extra soy milk, save it for other      purposes.) When all the mayonnaise is in the bowl, stir in      the lemon juice to whiten it.    </p>    <p>      Now that you've made soy mayonnaise, turn the creamy      mixture into Sweet Soy Mayonnaise Dressing by adding the      remaining ingredients.    </p>    <h3>      SESAME SALT    </h3>    <p>      8 cups brown (unhulled) sesame seeds<br />      1 cup sea salt    </p>        <p>      Roast the sesame seeds in a dry skillet, starting out with      the heat on medium-high and reducing it to a medium-low      flame when the seeds get fragrant and begin to toast. Stir      constantly, moving the seeds away from the sides of the pan      and toward the center in a circular pattern (if they brown      unevenly, the finished product won't grind uniformly).    </p>    <p>      When the seeds are all lightly browned and begin to poi,      take a pinch of them between your thumb and forefinger. If      they crack easily, they're done. Empty them into a      temporary container.    </p>    <p>      Now toast the sea salt over medium-high heat for five      minutes, and mix the salt and the seeds together well.      Blend no more than a cup of this mixture at a time for      about five-second intervals, stirring with a long utensil      (like a chopstick) when the blender is off to keep the      sesame salt from packing together. The idea is to blend the      seeds and salt just long enough to make a granular meal.      Store in an airtight jar to retain freshness. Yield: about      eight cups.    </p>    <h3>      YOGURT DRESSING    </h3>    <p>      4 tablespoons lemon juice<br />      1/4 cup oil<br />      1/4 cup water<br />      2 tablespoons honey<br />      4 tablespoons grated onion<br />      1 cup yogurt (or sour cream)<br />      1-1/2 cups soy mayonnaise (see recipe contained within      Sweet Soy Mayonnaise Dressing recipe above)<br />      2 teaspoons dill weed<br />      1 teaspoon celery seed<br />      2 teaspoons sea salt<br />      1/4 cup chopped parsley<br />      a pinch of cayenne pepper    </p>    <p>      Blend together the first five ingredients. Mix the      remaining ingredients in a bowl and combine them with the      blended mixture, stirring them well with a wire whisk.      Serve chilled. Makes 3-1/2 cups.    </p>
