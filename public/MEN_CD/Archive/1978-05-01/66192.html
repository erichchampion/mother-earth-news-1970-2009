                  <p>      From <em>Cycles of War: The Next Six Years</em> by R.E.      McMaster, Jr., copyright 1977 by Timberline Trust and      reprinted by permission of the author. Available in hard      cover ($11) from War Cycles Institute, P.O. Box 1673.      Kalispell, Mont. 59901.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      <em>R.E. McMaster, Jr. graduated cum laude from the      University of Houston, has been initiated into four      national honor societies, was both a United States Air      Force captain (certified to instruct in the supersonic      T-38) and a senior instructor at the U.S. Air Force      Academy, has been-at one time-one of only five      Commodity Trading Advisors formally approved by the      international firm of Hornblower and Weeks, and is      currently editor of The Reaper . . . a respected      internationally circulated economic and trading advisory      service which specializes in the analysis of commodity      markets.</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>It is news when a man of Mr. McMaster's stature spends      13 years researching a book and it is news when that book      is finally published. Especially when the finished      work-in this case, Cycles of War:</em> The Next Six      Years <em>-documents the fact that a great number of      business, weather, and other cycles all point to one thing:      the extremely high probability of international wars,      national revolutions, riots, and other conflicts in our      very immediate future. Here are some brief excerpts from      Cycles of War. We hope they'll whet your appetite enough to      make you want your own copy of the book.</em>    </p>    <p>      It has become apparent to me-through traveling around      the country, speaking to investment groups, and visiting      with Americans-that there is a nagging sense of      uneasiness among our citizenry, about the future of the      United States over the next few years. Investors are intent      upon retrenching and maintaining their wealth. Caution is      their watchword. The "sensitives" of the country-the      psychics, poets, artists, composers, and writers-all      express considerable insecurity over the future at hand.      Intellectuals and educators are voicing concern, and the      masses are beginning to feel impending danger. The      nostalgia of the past few years is only an indication of      the wish to withdraw to more pleasant times.    </p>    <p>      In <em>Cycles of War: The Next Six Years,</em> I shall      bring to light evidence that not only substantiates but      helps to account for this condition of national      restlessness.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      The institute of war lies close to the heart of mankind . .      . In our recent Western history, war has been following war      in an ascending order of intensity. If the series      continues, the progression will indubitably be carried to      even higher terms, until this process of intensifying the      horrors of war is one day brought to an end by the      self-annihilation of the war-making society.    </p>    <p>      This is the somber conclusion of the leading secular      historian of the twentieth century, Arnold Toynbee.      Toynbee's words are food for thought, particularly when one      considers that the man spent forty years writing three      million words with well over 19,000 footnotes for his      monumental work, <em>A Study of History.</em>    </p>    <p>      Yet, among U.S. citizens, discussion of warfare is as rare      as a fulfilled political promise. It could almost be      classified as a social taboo, not proper for conversation      at bridge clubs, cocktail parties, poker games, or      gatherings for Monday Night Football. It hardly goes down      well with a Ritz or a Schlitz. (Few Americans, however,      would be willing to bet their lives that the subject is      unimportant.)    </p>    <p>      So, except for the poor souls plagued with hostile and/or      destructive tendencies, war is a subject relegated to the      moviemakers, the military, the poets, and the philosophers      . . . unlikely bedfellows, to say the least.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      At the outset, it is important to note that warfare doesn't      spring upon one like a surprise party. One doesn't come      home, unlock the door, turn on the light, and discover a      war in the living room. Rather, it is like an approaching      thunderstorm. The clouds build up, the darkness increases,      and thunder and lightning give advance warning.    </p>    <p>      For the purpose of discussion here, warfare is to be      considered any type of violent human conflict.      International warfare is a social activity that requires      the greatest amount of teamwork and integration of effort      by the whole society. Labor, the industrial complex, the      military, the government . . . all subordinate their      special interests to the violent adventure. Thus,      international warfare necessarily takes place between      mature civilizations which are complex and technologically      efficient, and which have sophisticated international      communications and pervasive governments.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      As Karl von Clausewitz stated in his classic, <em>On      War,</em>    </p>    <p>      <em>"War is an act of force to compel our adversary to our      will . . . Political intentions are the objects, and the      war is the means. The nature of war is therefore determined      by political objects . . . It is, therefore, a political      act."</em>    </p>    <p>      Historically, the political act of war by the United States      has <em>supposedly</em> been with the consent of the      people.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      While international war is an example of coordinated social      process, the internal wars of the      nation/state-revolutions, civil wars,      riots-represent a collapse of the social order, a      disintegration of coordinated activity. Civil war occurs      most often when there is a highly centralized government,      when the nation is geographically large, and when the      culture is heterogeneous. It can also be triggered by      governmental failure to fulfill the expectations of ethnic      groups, or when the necessities of life are in scarce      supply.    </p>    <p>      The incidence of warfare has much to do with timing. Timing      in life is everything. Those who fish, make or catch      passes, buy and sell stock, or fly airplanes will readily      agree. If the weight of the evidence gives a high      probability of warfare during a certain period of time,      then one can ill afford not to structure one's activities      accordingly.    </p>    <p>      It is my own conclusion that the American nation will be      forced to struggle with both internal conflict and      international war within the next six years.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      The prospect of a second American Revolution was discussed      in the November 1976 issue of <em>International      Moneyline,</em> when Crane Brinton's <em>Anatomy of      Revolution</em> was reviewed. Brinton had studied the      periods of time just prior to four major revolutions. He      analyzed the French Revolution, the Russian Revolution of      1917, the American Revolution, and the Glorious Revolution      of England in 1688. The similarities of these periods to      present conditions in the United States are ominous.    </p>    <p>      Brinton found that, in each situation, revolution was      foreshadowed by the potential or approaching bankruptcy of      the government. It is not with much comfort, then, that we      note that the National Tax Foundation has reported the      current commitments and liabilities of the U.S. Government      to be in excess of $7.56 trillion. The words of Thomas      Jefferson return to haunt us: "I place economy among the      first and most important virtues, and public debt as the      greatest of dangers . . . "    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Just as serious a threat today is Inflation, which is      simply the result of an in. crease in the supply of money.      And since government is the creator of money, and regulates      the supply thereof, it is also the creator of inflation.      The government can work to increase the money supply in a      variety of ways: through the Federal Reserve's open market      operations (the discount rate and reserve requirements),      through the fractional reserve banking system which creates      credit, or simply by printing money.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      Very small changes in climate cause severe disruptions in      human life. This exhaustively researched conclusion was      reached by Nels Winkless III and Then Browning in their      scholarly work, <em>Climate and the Affairs of Men.</em>      Their study revealed that:    </p>    <p>      <em>"Changing climate alters the amount and nature of food      supply . . . the marginal croplands of the world become      submarginal and food production even in comparatively rich      agricultural areas is disrupted . . . highly productive      food plant strains cannot tolerate large variation in      environment . . . "</em>    </p>    <p>      Winkless and Browning noted that the climate in the recent      past has been the warmest and most benevolent in hundreds      of years, and that the world should soon return to harsher,      more "normal" conditions.    </p>    <p>      This situation is accentuated by a cooling trend in the      climate such as the one we are facing presently. <em>The      Morgan Guaranty Survey</em> of New York, March 1977, noted      that 23 of the 28 scholars who published papers on      climatology in recent years thought the earth will be      cooler within the next decade than it is today.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      In the January 1977 issue of Cycles, Jack Sauers, a      geologist and member of the Foundation for the Study of      Cycles, stated that:    </p>    <p>      <em>" . . . only every other 50-year cycle does the U.S.      solve its monetary problems by going back on the gold      standard. Perhaps you can add your current Federal Reserve      Notes to your collection of Civil War greenbacks and      Confederate money of 100 years ago, or your Continentals,      the Revolutionary script of 200 years ago . . .      "<br /></em>    </p>    <p>      The "gold bugs" should smile. We should return shortly to a      gold standard. Unfortunately, if Sauers's cycle occurs,      we'll have a revolution to live through first.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      In 1925, Nikolai D. Kondratieff, a Russian economist and      Director of the Conjuncture Institute of Moscow, published      his work on Western economic cycles. It has become      popularly known as the Kondratieff Wave. Kondratieff's      thesis is basically that the free world economy fluctuates      In an economic cycle that peaks approximately every 54      years. He based his studies upon such items as industrial      production, wages, wholesale prices, and interest rates.      France, Great Britain, the United States, and Germany were      the nations Kondratieff studied.    </p>    <p>      Kondratieff actually stated that the cycle could vary      between 48 and 60 years. This is logical: Cycles can      extend, contract, and even sometimes disappear where human      action is involved. It's only been in more recent times      that the Wave has been pinpointed to 54 years from peak to      peak.    </p>    <p>      Kondratieff's work wasn't appreciated in Russia, since his      Wave implied that the capitalistic system was basically      self-correcting . . . an idea contrary to the thinking of      Marx. Nikolai was exiled to a labor camp in Siberia as a      result of his efforts.    </p>    <p>      Nor did the Western world, indoctrinated in the god of      rationalism/reason (humanism), take too kindly to      Kondratieff's work. The very concept of a cycle falls in      the school of economic determinism, which says-in      effect-that man has little or no control over his      destiny. The event will occur to fit the cycle. Cycle says,      "Thumbs up," . . . thumbs up. Cycle says, "Thumbs down," .      . . thumbs down, as it were. Obviously, this humbling      revelation by Kondratieff did not set well with      intellectuals and university professors. It made them      (particularly the fundamental economists) look foolish at      best, useless at worst.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      In any case, the Wave runs roughly as follows: At its      trough, there's a war. Then the Cycle moves up for slightly      longer than 20 years. These are the good times, times of      peace and prosperity. Next, there's a sharp drop-off, as in      1974, followed by a plateau period of between 7 and 10      years. (There is also a war near the peak period.) After      the plateau, it's all downhill for the next 20 years or so.    </p>    <p>      There are some signs that the late 1970's are the plateau      period of the Kon dratieff Wave. The era has witnessed      relatively good economic stability and good times, free of      the severe inflation of the previous era. But the storm      clouds of economic protectionism are building. And there      are still rising prices, and economic expectations have not      eased or retrenched on the part of the masses, which should      have occurred during a plateau period. The caldron that      bubbles below the apparently cool lid of today's cities can      best be seen by the riots, burning, and looting during the      New York City blackout of 1977.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      W.D. Gann is a market legend today, as he was in his own      time. He was a genius who was held in awe by the lesser      stock and commodity traders during the first half of this      century. Thought by many to be arrogant and proud, Gann      simply ex hibited the self-confidence that comes from      wisdom, knowledge, and understanding.    </p>    <p>      Gann's genius was confirmed by the fact that more than 85%      of his predictions over many years were correct. He pulled      more than $50 million from the stock and commodity markets      over a fifty-year period, because he knew well ahead of      time exactly what the markets would do.    </p>    <p>      Gann studied, really studied. His charts and other work on      markets literally fill a moving van. It's doubtful that the      efforts of ten men, working all their lives, could equal      his production. He researched some commodities back four      centuries in order to learn their natural cycles.    </p>    <p>      And Gann also peered into the future to see what was ahead.      In 1914, he predicted World War 1. In March of 1918, he      called for the end of the war and the Kaiser's abdication.      In July of 1939, he predicted the beginning of World War      II.    </p>    <p>      W.D. Gann passed from this earth in 1956. His war charts      foresaw Vietnam, <em>and they also predict war in      1982-83.</em>    </p>		<hr />    <p>      It may well be that during the next six years true wealth      will be measured by having plenty of food to eat and water      to drink, good health, and safe and warm living quarters in      the midst of friends and family. The cycles say the judge      with the sword is on the way.    </p>    <p>      One can best prepare for such a difficult period by doing      whatever one can to become self-sufficient. I recommend      creative brainstorming with like-minded friends and family,      because-in hard times-no man is an island:      Group efforts and support are a must.    </p>    <p>      Start with the basics, such as self-sufficiency in the      production of food, water, shelter, clothing, and energy. A      garden, a greenhouse, a hydroponics system, and the raising      of small animals such as rabbits, milk goats, and chickens      are excellent for food production. Property on a creek or      near a body of water, a spring, a windmill, a cistern . . .      all fulfill the water self-sufficiency requirements. A      well-insulated dwelling with a wind or solar energy source      makes sense, as does a wood-fired heater and cookstove.      Underground protection is a must, and an oversupply of      clothing for all seasons is recommended. Provision for      self-defense goes without saying, and excess capital should      be applied toward barter items and real money: gold and      silver coins.    </p>		<hr />    <p>      As is said in real estate, the three most important      considerations are location, location, and location. At a      certain point of time in the near future, living in the      cities could be the equivalent of holding a stick of      lighted dynamite. The best locations would then be in rural      communities that meet the following criteria:    </p>    <p>      1. Low crime rate, traditional American values of hard work      and self-sufficiency, conservative political leanings,      ethics based on absolutes    </p>    <p>      2. Racial harmony    </p>    <p>      3. A widely dispersed local population (low population      density)    </p>    <p>      4. Necessary skills widely distributed in the local      population (medical, dental, carpentry, etc.)    </p>    <p>      5. No potential military targets within a 100-mile radius    </p>    <p>      6. No large government installations of any type    </p>    <p>      7. Favorable wind currents and climate that provide ample      moisture, good growing conditions, and no danger of fallout    </p>    <p>      8. More than a tank of gas away from any major city    </p>    <p>      9. A commodity-based economy    </p>    <p>      10. Low risk of earthquake, volcanic activity, flood, and      fire.    </p>    <p>      There's no such thing as neutralizing all risks, because      there's no place on earth where all of the above criteria      are perfectly met. Life itself is a risk . . . perfect      security doesn't exist. Lack of perfection, however,      doesn't justify a "let's eat, drink, and be merry"      attitude. Risk must be managed . . . that's the prudent      approach. This work has attempted to show that during the      next six years the risk of war is very high. In light of      this, priority should be given to preparation for the      coming difficult times.    </p>
