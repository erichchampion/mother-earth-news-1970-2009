               	 <hr />    <p>      <strong>For the past several years, the good folks at the      Institute for Local Self-Reliance in Washington, D.C. have      worked to help urban residents gain greater control over      their lives through the use of low-technology, decentralist      tools and concepts. We strongly believe that more people      (city dwellers and country folk alike) should be exposed to      the Institute's efforts . . . which is why we're now making      this "what's happening where" report by ILSR staffers one      of MOTHER's regular features.</strong>    </p>    <p>      A few years ago-long before President Carter made his      now-historic visit to the area-two veteran community      workers named Irma Fleck and Jack Flanagan decided that      what New York's South Bronx needed more than anything else      was [1] local economic development, and [2] some kind of      program for the reclamation of vacant land.    </p>    <p>      Not knowing how to solve the former problem, Fleck and      Flanagan turned their attention first to the problem of      land reclamation . . . the problem of how to put almost 500      rubble-strewn acres of vacant South Bronx land to good use.    </p>    <p>      Some lots-the community workers reasoned-could      be made into parks. (In the South Bronx, as in many cities,      recreational space is scarce.) Other pieces of property      might be turned into community gardens, thus allowing local      residents to cut their food costs and improve their diets.      Unfortunately, there was just one hang-up: Neither grass      (for parks) nor tomatoes (and other crops) can thrive on      backfilled brick and broken glass. Before the vacant South      Bronx land could be "greened", it would have to be made      fertile and free of lead (and other hazards).    </p>    <p>      The usual way of changing infertile land to fertile is by      having topsoil trucked in and applied thickly. To spread      the necessary eight inches of such soil on the South      Bronx's empty lots, however, would have cost more than      $13,000 an acre . . . a price that the city was unwilling      (and community groups unable) to pay.    </p>    <p>      Ultimately, Irma Fleck and Jack Flanagan were able to come      up with a better idea: Cover the lots not with topsoil, but      with <em>compost made from local wastes.</em> To carry out      this idea, Jack and Irma-in mid-1976-formed the      Bronx Frontier Development Corporation, which is now on its      way to becoming one of the largest composting firms in the      U.S.    </p>    <p>      Raw materials for the compost project were not hard to      find. As luck would have it, the South Bronx is blessed      with the Hunts Point Produce Market, a huge      fruit-and-vegetable emporium that generates as much as 75      cubic yards of organic wastes each day. Before Fleck and      Flanagan came along, these wastes were being carted from      the market to a Queens landfill at a cost of $3.50 per      cubic yard. Bronx Frontier now plans to use the Hunts Point      Produce Market's garbage as the main ingredient of a      special compost mixture that will eventually be produced at      the rate of 1,200 cubic yards a month. (This will be enough      compost to cover 17 acres of land six inches deep each and      every year.)    </p>    <p>      Bronx Frontier's compost will consist of vegetable and      fruit wastes from the Hunts Point Produce Market, leaves      from suburban New Rochelle, and-if      necessary-gypsum wastes and horse manure, all mixed      together by a gigantic, $50,000 compost-turning machine.      The initial batch of the enriching mixture should be ready      for distribution by the time this comes out in print.    </p>    <p>      Fleck and Flanagan say that all of the first year's compost      will be donated to community groups for the development of      gardens and recreational land in the South Bronx. Last      summer, there were 40 Cornell University Extension      Service-supported community vegetable gardens in the area.      These gardens (each acre can provide all the vegetables      consumed annually by between 40 and 68 people) will be      among the first to benefit.    </p>    <p>      In the second year, 50% of Bronx Frontier's compost will be      marketed to sod farmers, greenhouse owners, and home      horticulturists for use as a fertilizer/soil conditioner      and the other 50% will go to community groups.    </p>    <p>      Every year thereafter, a percentage of Bronx Frontier's      production will be set aside for use by community groups,      and the rest will be sold to generate revenue for the      business (which will be one of the largest commercial      composting operations in the country). In today's world of      skyrocketing fertilizer prices, Bronx Frontier's      compost-at $12 per ton-should be in great      demand.    </p>    <p>      The Fleck-Flanagan compost-production project was not a      simple one to pull together. Conceptualization and planning      have taken two years. Negotiations with city, state, and      federal governments and with local Hunts Point businesses      were complex. Initial start-up funding had to come from a      variety of sources and each piece of the package was      difficult to put into operation. (Before they could get      funding, Fleck and Flanagan had to show their sponsors that      composting could be an economically viable enterprise.)      Last but not least, Bronx Frontier had to obtain technical      assistance for the composting process itself. (Here, the      corporation received help from the Institute for Local      Self-Reliance and other groups and individuals.)    </p>    <p>      Now-two years later-all the pieces are starting      to fall into place. Bronx Frontier Development Corporation      is in business, and Irma Fleck and Jack Flanagan have begun      (at last) to make major progress toward their twofold goal      of economic development and land reclamation in the South      Bronx. At the same time, Irma and Jack have spawned a      project that may well serve as both a model and an      inspiration to people in other decaying inner cities.      Because, as Jack says, "If it can be done in the South      Bronx . . . it can be done anywhere!"    </p>			 <hr />    <p>      <em>To get on the mailing list for ILSR's bi-monthly      magazine,</em> Self-Reliance, <em>send $6.00 to ILSR, 1717      18th St. N.
