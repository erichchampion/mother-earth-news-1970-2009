              	<hr />    <p>      If you now operate-or have <em>ever</em>      operated-a successful home business that was inspired      by an article you read In MOTHER, tell us (in 500 words or      less) when and where-and with how much "seed      money"-you started your venture. Because if your      story can be fitted into an upcoming installment of      BOOTSTRAP BUSINESSES, you'll receive [1] the warm      satisfaction of knowing that you helped someone else find      the happiness you enjoy and [2] a free <em>two-year</em>      new or renewal subscription to THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted)      .    </p>    <p>      We'd have written in sooner, MOTHER, but ever since we      first read the two-part article ("Dimensional Wood Signs .      . . How to Make 'Em and Sell 'Em") in Issue Nos. 36 and 37      about making $10,000 a year with a wood sign business . . .      we've been too darn busy making signs to stop and write!    </p>    <p>      Back around January of last year my husband and I began      thinking seriously about starting our own home business.      I'd become disillusioned with my dead-end outdoor      advertising position (too much work for too little pay) . .      . end I was ready to quit my job, escape from mediocrity,      and drop into something more challenging.    </p>    <p>      I thought back to our college days when the two of us      operated an art-and-design service. We painted murals and      super-graphics, drew ads, lettered posters, even      silk-screened T-shirts! It all helped supplement our      tuition costs each quarter. That work was certainly      appealing, and the experience was useful . . . but I didn't      think it would be substantial enough financially to provide      us with a solid means of income.    </p>    <p>      That's when we came across MOTHER's wood sign business      article! Now this really seemed like an exciting home      enterprise for us to attempt. And we already had      contacts-local architects, contractors, business      owners-who could help! So, after talking to some of      these people (and getting a couple of large orders), we      decided there was a definite trend-and      <em>market</em> -for wood signs in our area. As a      result, I quit my job and my husband remained at his      architectural office on a freelance-only basis.    </p>    <p>      Our total grubstake was only large enough to carry us      through a month or so of the usual personal expenses. And      when we applied for a bank loan we were promptly told we      couldn't qualify because we lacked a credit rating. In      other words, we didn't owe anybody anything! We'd expected      this, though, and weren't discouraged. The important thing      was to get started.    </p>    <p>      Our first signs were made with borrowed and/or leased      tools. We required a down payment (on work to be done)      which would more than cover the cost of any raw materials      needed for each job. As we were paid for each completed job      we then channeled nearly all of the money toward the      purchase of new power tools. This equipment made the      subsequent signs easier-and quicker-to      construct. And the better we outfitted our shop, the larger      and more complex projects we could handle . . . which, of      course, meant more income. And so on.    </p>    <p>      We took photos of each completed sign and produced a small      brochure of our work. The brochures (along with our      business cards) were then passed out liberally in order to      generate still more business. And-whenever we could      afford it-we placed a professional-quality display ad      for our services in the local paper.    </p>    <p>      The increasing workload which resulted from this promotion      soon forced my husband to devote his skills almost full      time to our new business, and we converted the garage into      a full-fledged woodworking shop. Worktables were built and      tools were organized . . . all designed to help us produce      signs accurately and efficiently.    </p>    <p>      Our bootstrap business is over a year old now and we      consider it a (growing) success. MOTHER's article said we      could make $10,000 a year and, frankly, we've made a bit      <em>more</em> than that. Although most of our money so far      has gone toward the purchase of quality tools, we've still      earned enough income to keep us going. And we're really      looking forward to facing a new year with the tremendous      advantage of experience and-finally-being      completely prepared. Naturally, we expect to do well again      this year.    </p>    <p>      Setting up our own business obviously required a lot of      persistence. The only thing "easy" about it, in fact, was      that we <em>enjoy</em> what we're doing. We even enjoy the      inevitable hassles of business because we know we're going      through them for ourselves, not for some indifferent boss      or company. And even though we were already familiar with      some of the information in MOTHER's story, just knowing      that there was somebody else out there making a living and      having a good time at it gave us just the boost we needed.    </p>    <p>      So-now that we can speak from experience-we      encourage anyone who's tired of working for someone else to      stop for a minute and take an inventory of his/her personal      resources, talents, and potential. Unless you think about      it, it may be easy to overlook a set of circumstances      unique to you . . . circumstances that are just waiting to      be developed into something useful. With planning, hard      work, (play), and a little luck, things tend to fall in      place. And then you're on your own <em>free way</em> . . .      as far as you want to go.    </p>    <p>      Ron & Midori Werner<br />      Knoxville, Tenn.    </p>    <p>      While looking for an inspiration for something I could do      to earn some extra dollars and still keep up my chores      around the house . . . THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) arrived.      And there among the pages of Issue No. 47 was Andee      Carlsson's beautiful-and inspiring-article      about freelance housecleaning.    </p>    <p>      As I read Ms. Carlsson's story it occurred to me that this      kind of housecleaning-for-profit could be fun to do with a      friend. So I called a neighbor who I knew was also looking      for part-time work, told her about MOTHER ( <em>tried</em>      to anyway . . . she already knew!), and we agreed to work      together.    </p>    <p>      My previous experience selling cosmetics provided      help-in the form of a customers list-and we      were able to offer our services to a group of women that, 1      knew, mostly worked full time. Two of the ladies needed      help right away . . . and within a fortnight we had six      clients, were working two full days each week, and were      making $18-$20 per house! (Since most people prefer      to have their homes cleaned for the weekend, we work only      on Thursday and Friday . . . exactly the "dream schedule"      we'd wanted!)    </p>    <p>      When a prospective client contacts us we arrange to meet at      her home one evening. This way we get to know each other      and also get a better idea-together-of what      needs to be done to the house. We then have all the      information we need to quote a fair price estimate.    </p>    <p>      Our usual fee is $20 for each of the first two cleanings.      For an average three-bedroom, two-bath house, the price      then remains at $20 . . . but for smaller houses-and      less work-we lower the charge to $18 after the      initial two jobs. Also, after the first cleaning, I always      call each new customer on the phone and make sure that our      work was satisfactory. In addition I ask that the homeowner      leave a note whenever there is anything special that she      wants done.    </p>    <p>      Our workday begins at 8:30 a.m. We live eight miles outside      of the town where we do most of our jobs and take turns      driving. My friend and I clean one house in the morning and      another in the afternoon, and we work straight through till      we finish the job. All but one of our customers are      teachers . . . it's so much easier to work when no one else      is in the house.    </p>    <p>      We keep all the woodwork-kitchen cabinets,      etc.-clean by washing them down and/or waxing them.      Whatever's necessary. We also clean windows, dust, vacuum,      wash floors, clean the refrigerator, freezer, oven, just      about everything! One of our customers is in the process of      moving and we even helped her pack.    </p>    <p>      Our housecleaning operation has worked out well for all      concerned. We're happy and the ladies we work for are too.      It's a good feeling . . . thanks to Andee and to MOTHER!    </p>    <p>      Irene Mangold<br />      Grants Pass, Ore.    </p>    <p>      Well, MOTHER, as a direct result of the informative article      on chimney sweeps ("Chimney Sweeps Are Cleaning Up!") in      Issue No. 49, my friend Bill and I are headlong into our      own private enterprise.    </p>    <p>      Although we couldn't advertise on a large scale (there's      only one paper in town . . . but <em>everybody</em> reads      it!) we did do a chimney scouring for the owner of that one      local paper . . . and he had us written up in a fine      article. And-since our first jobs were monumental      successes-many of the housewives we worked for lined      up additional work for us with their friends. Word-of-mouth      advertising put us over the top!    </p>    <p>      Our initial investment was about $145, and that could've      been pared down by $25 or so if we knew what was going on.      The biggest single expenditure we had was a $35 dry-pickup      shop vacuum cleaner from Sears. Brushes and other general      cleaning gear accounted for the rest of the money we spent.    </p>    <p>      We start our jobs right at the customer's front door by      unrolling old newspapers (taped together into a walkway)      from the door to the hearth. Next, Bill and I clean out the      ashes from the firebox and cover the opening (again, with      recycled newspaper) to prevent any soot from escaping. Then      it's up the ladder for a thorough cleaning job on the      chimney. Since most of the flues we clean are only 10 to 14      feet high, we use a scrub brush connected to a 12-foot-long      pipe.    </p>    <p>      We then scurry back down the ladder to scour and vacuum out      the firebox, and (the only halfway hard part of the whole      process) vacuum the shelf. Finally we roll up our paper      walkway and the job is finished. Our average total time is      one and a half to two hours and our patrons are more than      happy to pay the $25 fee.    </p>    <p>      As an added bonus to those we serve, we give a $5 cash      referral fee to any customers who supply us with new      chimneys to sweep. So, though we're only really making $20      per job, it's certainly worth it to us.    </p>    <p>      Bill and I would be more than happy to offer advice on our      bootstrap business to anyone wishing encouragement or      general information. It took us exactly two weeks from the      discovery of your article to when the first check came in.      Not too bad!    </p>    <p>      Again, thanks MOTHER, for getting us started.    </p>    <p>      Joel Baldwin & Bill Lannon<br />      12012 Ice Caves Rd.<br />      Grants, N.M. 87020    </p>    <p>      During the spring of 1971 we bought some back issues of      MOTHER at a yard sale. Along about the same time we became      interested in the ideas of the back-to-the-land      homesteading movement. Little did we realize at the time,      however, that those magazines would guide us into a home      business that would endure for nearly three years!    </p>    <p>      The versatility of the rabbit had long intrigued us, and we      decided to try raising some of the critters ourselves. But      we needed plans for a rabbit hutch. Lo and behold!      MOTHER-as usual-had the answer. Issue No. 6      contained J.N. Peterson's dandy "Pequoda's Rabbit Hutch".      We modified J.N.'s ideas a bit, changed the diagrams to      suit the lumber we'd scrounged, and built four nice      hutches. (One for the doe, one for the buck, and two for      that <em>enormous</em> number of rabbits we just knew were      on the way!)    </p>    <p>      Well, seven months came and went and our "pair" still      hadn't reproduced. Turns out we had two does! So we located      a rabbit raiser some 10 miles from us who then sold us a      "guaranteed, genuine male" for our two ladies.    </p>    <p>      Thirty-eight days later we had 16 adorable baby rabbits on      our hands. And, although a chilling rain struck the      rabbitry while we were gone (over the Thanksgiving      holidays), we didn't lose a single bunny. Come Easter we      sold every animal . . . and had orders for more!    </p>    <p>      Repeatedly we were asked "Why is <em>your</em> rabbit so      much sweeter and tastier?" The little lettuce munchers were      fed as organically as possible, and we tend to believe      that's why they tasted so good. Apparently our customers      agreed, because they returned again and again.    </p>    <p>      Bad luck (in the form of some neighbor's dogs) finally put      us out of the bunny business some three years later. That      was the only sad episode, though, in our entire      rabbit-raising career and, thanks to MOTHER's initial help,      we had a better, more interesting way of life. A way of      life, in fact, that we intend to go back to this summer      (we've <em>still</em> held onto Pequoda's plans!).    </p>    <p>      Rosemarie Randolph<br />      Paris, Tenn.    </p>    <p>      When Foxfire (my golden retriever) and I read "It Pays to      be an Old Sew-and-Sew" by Edith Kilgo in MOTHER NO. 48, we      had to agree that it sounded good. I already owned all the      equipment needed for a home-sewing operation, so-by      simply placing an ad in the local paper-I was sure I      could be in business. That'd be especially nice for that      time in the far-off future when we (Foxfire and I) might      need some extra money.    </p>    <p>      For the time being, though, I tore myself away from MOTHER      and went back to being a conscientious college student.      Apparently Foxfire read the article again . . . a couple      hours later a wet nose poked my ribs to remind me about      dinner. And when I plunged the dog dish into the food bag      all I got was a clunk as the pan hit bottom. Empty again!      As Foxfire and I dined together that evening on bean      sprouts and oatmeal for two, I decided that maybe the      "future" wasn't as far off as I'd reckoned.    </p>    <p>      The following day I placed a $2.00 ad in the local paper      announcing "Sewing done for the holidays". The calls      started coming in the very next morning. Alterations, choir      outfits, blankets, dresses . . . you name it!    </p>    <p>      Being a bit over-enthusiastic by nature I accepted two      choir outfit jobs with an over-the-weekend-Monday-morning      deadline. For help I resorted to one of our most precious      commodities . . . good ole Mom. (Folks, don't ever throw      'em out. Even after you've declared your independence,      <em>your</em> mother's value doesn't depreciate.) Mom      helped me finish the choir outfits and I was able to sew a      blouse and do three additional alterations as well.    </p>    <p>      I'm afraid I didn't start out as a very hardnosed      businesswoman . . . at least not by Edith Kilgo's      standards. For those three days, we (my mother and I)      cleared $70. By Edith's price list recommendations we      should've made at least $125. The problem was basically      that of the beginner's      who-would-want-to-pay-for-something-made syndrome. After      seeing happy, satisfied customers, though, I am definitely      improving.    </p>    <p>      Within a month I've made enough money to "stock the larder"      for my next quarter's scholastic haul and I've also kept as      many customers as I can possibly handle and still go to      school. I'm trying not to get too excited about it all . .      . but this could-thanks to MOTHER-mean a new pair of      Levi's!    </p>    <p>      Lisa Laursen<br />      Murray. Utah    </p>
