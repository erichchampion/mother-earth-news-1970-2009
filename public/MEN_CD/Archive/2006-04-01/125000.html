        St. Patrick's Day has come and gone, but you can 'go green' thisEaster by coloring eggs with plant-based dyes, or preparing eggsfrom 'Easter-egg chickens,' such as Araucana and Welsumer breeds,that lay naturally colorful eggs.<br /><br /><b>Natural Eggs</b><br />The simplest colored Easter eggs come straight from the chicken.Araucana chickens, originally from South America, lay pale blue andgreen eggs, and Welsumer chickens lay fun, speckled brown eggs thatoutwardly resemble chocolate. If you raise these chickens in yourown backyard, their eggs will also be better for your health. Birdsraised on a grass diet lay eggs with less cholesterol and morevitamin E, beta carotene and omega-3 fatty acids. See<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/eggs" target="_blank">The Chicken and EggPage</a> on<a href="http://www.motherearthnews.com/" target="_blank">MotherEarthNews.com</a>for more information.<br /><br /><b>Natural Dyes</b><br />Easter eggs originated with ancient festivals celebrating thereturn of spring. In the Middle Ages, people painted bird's eggswith fresh, springtime colors and handed them out as gifts.<br /><br />This Easter try using natural materials to color your eggs. Somedyes work best when the coloring agent is boiled with the eggs,while others successfully stain pre-boiled eggs. For the brightestcolors, plan to let the eggs soak in dye for a few hours; if you'regoing to eat the eggs later, be sure to keep them in therefrigerator while soaking. White vinegar helps deepen colors; foreach dye mentioned below, we added 2 teaspoons of white vinegar tothe dye solution.<br /><br /><b>Blueberry Juice</b> ? For a light blue, soak pre-boiled eggs inthe juice from one 15-ounce can of blueberries for about half anhour; for a darker, navy blue soak up to three hours.<br /><br /><b>Dandelions</b> ? To turn eggs pale yellow, pick two cups ofdandelion heads, boil them with the eggs, then allow the cookedeggs to soak in the mixture for one to two hours.<br /><br /><b>Grape Juice</b> ? For a light violet, soak pre-boiled eggs inenough juice to cover them completely for half an hour; soak up tothree hours for a deeper blue color.<br /><br /><b>Red Cabbage</b> ? Red cabbage actually turns eggs blue! Toobtain a robin's-egg blue color, fill a medium-sized sauce pan withred cabbage leaves and boil them with the eggs. Once eggs arecooked, remove cabbage and soak them for at least an hour.<br /><br />Discovering which materials and quantities work best can be part ofthe fun! We tried other natural dyes that proved disappointing,including carrots, spinach, paprika, and cranberry juice cocktail(the juice from crushed cranberries might work better). Encouragechildren to help with the decision-making process, and be sure torecord your successes for future reference.
