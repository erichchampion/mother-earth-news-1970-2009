                <p>      <strong>Give your plants a "shot-in-the-stalks"      with.</strong>. .    </p>        <p>      Although you probably already "feed" your garden with      applications of organic fertilizers, dry weather and heavy      demands for minerals can still retard plant production      about halfway to the harvest. In addition, a catalyst may      sometimes be needed before your vegetables and flowers can      even "get at'' much of the food that's already locked into      the soil.    </p>        <p>      "Kickabrew" is a homemade mixture that can take care of      these problems. And-like the original "kickapoo"      concoction of the comic strip-this growth stimulator      can give your garden a powerful boost!    </p>    <p>      Since much of our soil has lost its nutrients to the      oceans, it's only logical that we turn to the sea to      reclaim some of those same elements. That's what kickabrew      does: The formula-which can be made in any amount      desired-is 1 part fish emulsion, 2 parts kelp      (dehydrated, powdered seaweed ), 10 parts dried cow manure,      and 50 parts water. (If you use wet manure ... increase its      quantity by onethird.)    </p>    <p>      To mix this preparation, use a container with some kind of      cover (to keep out flies and prevent the escape of annoying      odors). Then, let the brew stand for a day or so, stirring      it occasionally to blend the ingredients.    </p>    <p>      Corn, tomatoes, squash, melons, pe pers-and most of      your flowers and shrubs-will respond favorably to a      pint of the powerful potion. Just pour half of the measure      over the leaves (where the plant will take in some of the      food immediately) and pour the other half at the base. (Be      sure the application is followed by a heavy watering or      summer shower to transport these natural nutrients to the      roots.)    </p>    <p>      However, don't rush out and dose your garden too soon. Such      a potent stimulant should only be given to      well-established plants that have had time to form      substantial root systems.    </p>    <p>      Vegetables and flowers can be treated twice during their      growing seasons, but even <em>one</em> drink will make a      big difference in your food and floral yields. Established      shrubs and Imes should be given three doses during the late      spring and early summer, so their new growth will mature      well ahead of the first autumn freezes.    </p>    <p>      For acid-loving plants-such as blueberries or      strawberries, sweet azalea, spice bush, and hydrange      a-simply add a teaspoon of cider vinegar to each pint      of brew .. . then, sit back and watch these bushes take on      a glossy new look!    </p>    <p>      But, remember ... kickabrew application is a somewhat      smelly job, so put on your old clothes and shoes before you      start. (Isn't It strange how the most malodorous mixtures      seem to turn out the tastiest, biggest vegetables and      prettiest flowers?)    </p>    <p>      So, whip up a batch of homemade stimulator and give your      garden a little "libation". Believe me, you'll get ample      thanks come harvest time!    </p>
