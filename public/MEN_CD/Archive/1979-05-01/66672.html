                <p>      <strong>If the climate is right, even an amateur farmer can      grow enough of this life-sustaining commodity to feed a      family.</strong>    </p>    <h5 id="byline">      by EDWIN KESSLER    </h5>        <p>      <strong>Reprinted with permission from Natural History      August/September 1978. copyright© 1978 by the American      Museum of natural History, Central, Park West at 79th      street NewYork 10024 . One Year Subscription      $10.00.</strong>    </p>    <p>      Rice is the main food for half the world's population.      There are thousands of varieties of rice. All are crops of      warm climates and only a few new types produce well where      the mean temperature is 70°F (or higher) for less than      four months of the year.    </p>    <p>      In the United States, rice culture began in South Carolina      in 1694, but almost all, of our rice is now grown in      limited regions of Arkansas, California, Louisiana,      Mississippi, and Texas. The nutritive value of milled rice      is about that of potatoes, but in the rough, or unhulled,      form at everyday temperatures, rice can keep for several      years ... much longer than raw potatoes.    </p>        <p>      Yields around the world vary widely, from any 1,000 pounds      per acre on unfertilized plots dependent on fluctuating      rainfall to more than 6,000 pounds per acre where plant      variety is matched to optimum conditions of soil, water,      and temperature in United States production in 1976 was      nearly 13 billion pounds from 2.8 million acres, for an      average yield of 4,600 pounds per acre. More than half of      our production is exported ... major customers include      South Korea, South Africa, the Arab countries of the      Mideast, and some western European nations.    </p>    <p>      In the United States, commercial production is energy      intensive and usually employs chemical aids. Rice seed is      either sown by airplane in flooded fields or planted with      grain drills in fields drained for planting and      subsequently flooded. Weed-control herbicides such as 2,4-D      are commonly applied by airplane.    </p>    <p>      Fields are drained again before harvest and allowed to dry      sufficiently for combines to be used. Rice is hulled in      centrally located mills ... the largest process as much as      a billion pounds in a year. Milling nowadays is often      preceded by special processing ... which first places rough      rice under vacuum to remove air from the hull and kernel,      then steams it under high pressure. This practice, akin to      parboiling, drives some vitamins and minerals from the rice      hull into the kernel, producing a more nutritious,      longer-lasting final product. Milled rice is often further      enriched with vitamins and minerals before being packaged      for distribution to markets.    </p>    <p>      Civilizations tend to be only as strong and enduring as      their agricultural bases ... it is accordingly an      understatement to say that we should be concerned with what      is going on in U.S. agriculture. Commercial rice culture in      the United States illustrates many features of our total      agricultural system. It involves extensive use of fossil      fuels to power machinery, to fertilize, and to control      insect and plant pests. Most of us are better fed than      former populations. But our technological agriculture has      also introduced harmful synthetics into the environment and      replaced crop rotation with chemicals, resulting in the      loss of humus and increased erosion of sloping lands.    </p>    <p>      Our systems for the preservation and widespread      distribution of agricultural products have given us      yearround access to many hero tofore seasonal foods but      some of us miss the flavor of fresh, naturally ripened      produce, which is seldom available nowadays.    </p>    <p>      Energy- intensive farming in the United States has been      associated with social changes. There are fewer farmhands      in the nation now and more unemployed workers in the      cities. Since our agricultural methods rest significantly      on the depletion of nonrenewable resourc es, they resemble      some other features of our socioeconomic structure in that      they probably cannot be sustained over the long term.    </p>    <p>      My maternal grandfather was a farmer and rancher in south      Texas, so I was exposed to commercial agriculture as a      youngster during the early 1940's: After 10 years of adult      life in Norman, Oklahoma (population about      60,000)-and with our two sons out of high      school-my wife L ottie and I agreed that we should      try living on a farm.    </p>    <p>      Our 220-acre farm is mostly pasture. The original part of      our house was built by a family of Choctaw Indian descent,      which claimed 80 acres when the Indian lands in Oklahoma      were allocated to individuals at the start of this century.      I use a lot of old, but still functional, farm equipment      that is not in great demand by full-time farmers. Most of      it was pur chased for about 15 percent of the cost of new      equipment. Our farm income, which is derived principally      from honey sold to health food stores, amounts to less than      $1,000 per year. My agricultural      experiments-consequently-depend for their support on my      income as a meteorologist.    </p>    <p>      We have some cows and calves, plus chickens and ducks, a      productive apiary, a fine garden, a developing orchard, and      a lovely creek. Some of the numerous wild animals share our      produce, but they, in turn, are kept in check or at bay by      our dogs and cats and by various ad hoc strategies. There      is plenty of work, but we get some important help from a      friendly neighbor. We take much pleasure in our animals and      get much satisfaction from farm life. And we are learning.    </p>    <p>      For example, after tree seasons of experimentation, I have      developed a system (A rice cultivation that produces a good      yield with very little labor and no commercial fertilizers,      pesticides, or herbicides. My paddy is a 734-square-foot      oblong plot in which water normally stands after heavy      rains, making it unsuitable for common garden crops. The      topsoil is a dark loam, underlain by a slightly pervious      clay. An irrigation system provides water from Finn Creek,      made perennial by an upstream water-retention and      flood-control project built in 1965 by the Soil      Conservation Service.    </p>    <p>      In late winter or early spring I spread about 200 pounds of      old cow manure on the paddy and plow it into the soil with      the residue from the previous rice crop. For uniform      distribution of water to the new crop, I level the paddy      with a rake, boards, and a level indicator. Planting      sprouts instead of ungerminated seed gives the rice a start      over ungerminated weed seeds. So I place wet rough rice      from the previous crop in a covered can on top of a      hot-water heater. The seed sprouts very rapidly and is      ready to plant in a few days. About two pounds of seed      corresponds to the usual planting rate of a little more      than one hundred pounds per acre. I use a rototiller just      before planting ... this eliminates started weeds and      provides an appropriate seedbed. The slightly sprouted rice      is broadcast carefully by hand, raked gently to hide it      from birds, and then watered to provide a shallow cover.      Planting time in central Oklahoma is from May 1 to May 10.    </p>    <p>      I have heard that the planting of germinated seed is      practiced in the Philippines, but the traditional Oriental      method of rice growing involves cultivating the seedlings      in separate beds and then transplanting them. With the      transplanting method, two or sometimes three crops a year      can be grown in the same rice paddy if the climate is      suitably warm. Transplanting established plants gives the      rice a strong advantage over weeds, which then grow only      poorly in the shade of the larger rice plants.    </p>    <p>      The airplane method of seeding is very fast, of course, but      probably not adapted to the use of tender sprouted seed. In      most commercial practice, the rapid natural ascendancy of      sprouted or transplanted rice over weeds, coupled with some      manual labor for residual weed control, is traded for weed      control by chemical methods. The planting of germinated      seed is probably a good method for small-scale farming in      the United States ... since in most of the country the warm      season is not long enough for two rice crops, and weeds can      be particularly troublesome when the germination of      unsprouted rice seed is delayed by cool weather.    </p>    <p>      Rice is a beautiful plant and grows rapidly during      Oklahoma's typically hot July and August. In 1977, my paddy      required only one major weeding, which I did in about two      hours with feet kept bare so the rice plants could be felt      and not trampled. A major weed is barnyard grass, which      resembles rice until the seed stalks appear, but which is a      slightly darker green, has a diminutive or absent      ligule-instead of the conspicuous pubescent ligule of      rice-and Hems that are reddish at the base, while      those of rice are nearly white. A broad-leaved aquatic weed      with shallow roots is also common in my paddy, but it is      easily pulled up and eaten by our ducks. During midsummer,      the water surface shows tints of blue, indicative of      nitrogenfixing, bluegreen algae. The paddy is not a      significance cant source of mosquitoes, which are      apparently controlled by the numerous frogs attracted      during the summer growing season.    </p>    <p>      I harvest the rice when the kernels show the first signs of      falling from their panicles, about September 20 in      Oklahoma. My harvest date has been insensitive to the      planting date., de pending instead on the variety of rice      used. Birds are not a serious pest unless the rice stalks      are blown down, or lodged, by a severe storm ... the stalk      is not stiff enough to give even small birds a good perch.    </p>        <p>      I harvest the rice by hand in about an hour by successively      gathering together all the stalks I can embrace and cutting      them off with a knife. After the harvested stalks have      dried for a few weeks in a large wooden tray in the barn, I      remove more than 95 percent of the grain in about 15      minutes. This is done by striking the mass of stalks with      the flat of an ordinary pitchfork. The grain falls to the      bottom of the tray, and the stalks with unthreshed grain      are worked over by eager chickens.    </p>    <p>      The unpalatable rice hulls cling closely and tenaciously to      the kernels. Hulling consequently represents a major      obstacle for the small rice grower. The Oriental pounding      and rubbing methods involving a hollowed-out log seem      ill-adapted to our ways, although not having guidance in      such arts, I have probably not given them a fair trial.      Another technique-small, electrically powered rice hullers      used for testing grain sampled from commercial lots-seems      expensive for the small farmer (huller prices started at      about $600 in 1976). In my first hulling method I used a      tray lined with carborundum paper and rubbed the rice with      a similarly coated wooden block, but this procedure is      painfully slow and produces some undesirable grit.    </p>    <p>      In 1976 I purchased, for $143 delivered, a Java      hand-operated huller manufac tured in England (John Gordon      & Sons, Ltd., 196a High Street, Epping, Essex,      England). This small, sturdy machine, which should last for      decades, yields 5 to 10 pounds of milled rice per hour in      an easygoing operation by one person, including simple      winnowing of the outturn mixture of kernels and separated      hulls. The final product-brown rice, since only the outer      husk is removed from most kernels-cooks in 20 minutes. The      amount to be eaten in a month is all that should be milled      at one time because brown rice is vulnerable to attack by      insects and its oil can become rancid (of course, these      risks are minor if the rice is refrigerated).    </p>    <p>      My paddy, although poorly leveled in 1977 owing to an      error, provided 55 pounds of rough rice after threshing ...      which corre sponds to a yield of about 3,200 pounds per      acre. Approximately two-thirds of my total came from the      half paddy that was better watered, so I anticipate a yield      of 70 to 75 pounds with better leveling. But even 55 pounds      is more than adequate for a family of four, since the      annual per capita consumption in the United States is only      7-1/2 pounds of milled rice, derived from approximately 11      pounds of rough rice.    </p>    <p>      Some additional notes. My rice is Nova 66. 1 judge that      given suitable land and sufficient water of good quality,      the manual method of planting rice sprouts is practical for      a small farm family cultivating up to an acre of paddy.      This carries implications of a significant financial return      on labor, since the current retail price of rice in health      food stores is more than 504 per pound.    </p>    <p>      If an acre is planted, a small combine would be an      appropriate aid, and the Java huller would need a simple      conversion to belt drive to mill about 30 pounds of rice      per hour. Deep water is not necessary on rice plants,      although depths of six inches provide strong control of      weeds. But a minimum water depth of an inch or two is      required to keep the paddy continuously wet until the rice      kernels are well filled out. I watered for 40 minutes every      second or third day during the hot, dry summer of 1977 and      estimate that less than $1.50 was spent on electricity for      my one-horsepower pump throughout the season.    </p>    <p>      Overfertilizing will result in lush vegetative growth and      lodging of the stalks. I now apply cow manure once before      planting and leave the rest to the algae. The U.S.      Department of Agriculture and other agencies provide      instructions for achieving maximum yields by fertilizing      during midseason. The benefits of commercial processing can      be approached by parboiling rough rice and redrying before      hulling. This practice is common in many of the      less-developed countries where rice is grown in small plots      for local use.    </p>    <p>      EDITOR'S NOTE: Edwin Kessler, a meteorologist, is the      director of the National Severe Storms Laboratory ...      located in Norman, Oklahoma.    </p>
