    <p>
                        <p>      If you're tired of the same old arts-and-crafts scene and      looking for an exciting, different part-time pursuit ...      give some thought to the inexpensive, mysterious, Oriental      practice of sericulture (or silkworm cultivation).    </p>    <p>      The knowledge needed to raise such tiny "livestock" has      been handed (Own from generation to generation for      centuries, and the silkworm ranks with the honeybee as one      of the world's most profitable domestic insects.    </p>    <p>      Mary Stock (who lives in Canton, Ohio) started a silkworm      farm more than four years ago, and she's been kind enough      to share her knowledge with MOTHER's readers. In ancient      China, revealing such silkworm secrets would probably have      resulted in death by torture, and-even      today-printed matter on the subject is hard to come      by ... with most available texts written either in highly      technical terms or in Oriental languages!    </p>    <h3>      THE EGG AND YOU    </h3>    <p>      Ms. Stock says that-in sericulture at      least-there's definitely no question about whether      the moth or egg comes first ... it's the egg every time,      and these "silkworm seeds" are very difficult to find. In      fact, so few folks raise the little silkmaking machines      nowadays that Mary had to do a good bit of searching before      she located a supplier-Marguerite Shimmin (who lives      at 2470 Queensbury Road, Pasadena, California      91104)-and bought 200 eggs from that lady for $2.00      ... which was all the money that the Ohioan had to invest      to get her start in the silkworm business.    </p>    <p>      There is, however, one other requirement for successful      sericulture: a ready supply of mulberry leaves. The most      important variety-as far as hungry silkworms are      concerned-is Morus alba, the white-fruited mulberry      of China. This is a hardy tree that will grow in almost any      soil, and worms fed on its leaves are said to produce the      finest silk. Another popular species is the Morus nigra, or      black-fruited mulberry, which is native to Italy and      produces berries that make a great syrup or pie. You'll      find, however, that the caterpillars will munch away on any      kind of mulberry leaves you happen to have on hand.      (Consult the last section of this article for information      on where to buy mulberry seedlings.)    </p>    <p>      Three-year-old trees produce the best feed for silk      production, and a healthy mulberry should yield from 20 to      30 pounds of leaves during the time your worms are in their      growing stages. (That's about enough greenery to supply 100      wrigglers with chow for the 30 days-more or      less-that they'll need food.)    </p>    <p>      You may be able to locate silkworm eggs through your local      spinning and weaving organizations. It these sources don't      pail out, though, you can write to Marguerite in Pasadena      or Mary (at 3811 Lincoln Street East, Canton, Ohio 44707).      Both women will be glad to share their knowledge and egg      supplies, but be sure to send a self-addressed, stamped      envelope-and at least $2.00-with any request      for eggs or information.    </p>    <p>      Then, should your packet of "silkworm seeds" show up before      the local mulberry trees are in leaf, keep the embryos at      about 50°F (just place the paper towel or      napkin-on which the eggs arrive-in a sealed      jar, and store the container in the crisper compartment of      your 'fridge) until it's time to hatch them.    </p>    <h3>      WORM INCUBATION    </h3>        <p>      Once your trees have produced a good supply of feed, it's      time to "plant" your silk crop. Simply place the eggs-still      on their paper-in any available container (such as a      shoebox or dishpan) and put 'em in a warm, dry, well      ventilated spot. It's very important to keep all the eggs,      worms, cocoons, and moths out of drafts and direct sunlight      ... but they do need plenty of fresh air, so it's best not      to smoke around silkworms at any stage of their      development. The temperature of the incubating box should      be increased gradually over a couple of days, and then      'maintained as nearly constant as possi ble ... anywhere      from 68 to 77°F will do.    </p>    <p>      After three to ten days in the box (de pending on warmth,      humidity, and other factors) the majority of your eggs will      hatch within one ten-minute period ... usually during the      early morning. This means that you can wake up to find that      you have 200 very hungry mouths to feed! Any worms that      don't hatch out with the first group probably won't put in      their appearance until the following day. These late eggs      should be placed in another box, since they'll be on a      different molting and spinning schedule from the first-born    </p>    <p>      Keep in mind that your infant silkworms will be less than      1/8 of an inch long. Yet, one short month later the      critters will have attained 10,000 times their initial      weight ... and all that growth has to be fueled with      mulberry leaves.    </p>    <h3>      CARE AND FEEDING    </h3>    <p>      For your worms' early feedings, remove the leaf stems and      use only the tenderest top-of-the-tree leaves (remember to      strip the branches from the base to the tip ... in order      not to tear the bark or injure new buds). Such "starter      feed" should be chopped into 1/4-inch squares and-if      there's even a chance that the bush has been sprayed-washed      and thoroughly dried before the fodder is sprinkled evenly      about the box. It's best to pick the leaves fresh each day,      but an emergency supply can be stored in the crisper of      your refrigerator ... if, again, the greens are dried out      before they're offered to the hungry little critters.    </p>    <p>      The more your new charges eat, the bigger they'll get and      the more food they'll require. If you underfeed the worms      at any point, they may become so ravenous that they'll      overeat at the next meal and make themselves sick ... while      constant underfeeding can even lower the quality of their      silk! The trick is to give your worms adequate, regular      feedings, never let them run out of food, and always remove      old, wilted leaf pieces from the box.    </p>    <p>      In addition, the silkworms will be healthier if you clean      their "litter"-by sliding in fresh, dry pieces of      paper and removing (to the compost pile) the soiled      sheets-regularly. When this isn't done, molds can      form that could give rise to a number of worm diseases.    </p>    <p>      Though the caterpillars seem to eat more in the mornings      and evenings, they're actually chowing down at all hours.      The only times the worms will stop chewing are during their      four molting periods ... which occur about every five or      six days.    </p>    <p>      Shortly before each molt, the heads of the worms will      swell, their skins will lose color, and their bodies will      become transparent and immobile. (It's extremely important      that the larvae aren't moved or disturbed in any way at      this time.) During the 24-hour "skin-shedding process" your      wigglers will go into a sleep and lose all interest in      food. Otherwise, their appetites are regular and enormous.    </p>    <p>      Mary Stock reports that silkworms get especially voracious      in the last week before they start to spin. While in this      stage her 10,000 charges consume two and a half bushels of      mulberry leaves a day, and-though Mary already has 15 trees      on her 25-acre farm-she's in the process of planting 25      additional seedlings! (Besides providing worm food, the      trees make great windbreaks and produce quantities of      useful berries.)    </p>    <h3>      PUPA PREPARATIONS    </h3>    <p>      As the caterpillars increase in size, divide the brood into      several containers. Each individual needs space to grow ...      and you'll want to avoid conditions that force the critters      to Crawl over each other, because their velvet skins are so      delicate that even silkworm feet can tear them. When you      transfer the fragile larvae, it's best to wait until they      climb onto their food and then remove each wormleaf and      all-to new quarters.    </p>    <p>      Once the "spinning time" approaches (after three weeks or      so) provide containers with lots of edges, so your wiggly      weavers can quickly set up the "guide wires" from which      they'll hang their silken shelters. A number of small      strawberry boxes or egg cartons will be fine for this      purpose.    </p>    <p>      Then suddenly-anywhere from 25 to 32 days after      hatching-your caterpillars will stop eating and start      to produce silk.    </p>    <p>      You'll be able to tell when a worm is ready to spin,      because it will appear sluggish. Often the critter's head      will move from side to side as it seeks a suitable location      for its new home. (Since the larvae have no eyes, try to      make sure that they don't have to travel far to find a      suitable corner.)    </p>    <p>      A silkworm "sets up shop" by secreting a filament from an      orifice located just below its mouth. As strands leave this      opening, they make contact with another secretion called      sericin which becomes sticky when it's exposed to the air.      This "glue" allows the incredible little workers to set      their guide wires and shape their cocoons.    </p>    <p>      After the caterpillar has anchored its crude hammock, it      will lie on its back, double up its legs, contract its      body, and force the filament from within. The small spinner      won't take the easy way out and weave Its womb in circles      from one end to the other. Instead-with its head bobbing      and weaving at a rate of 69 times per minute-the amazing      creature produces a pattern of figure eights, layer upon      layer, until its shell is formed.    </p>    <p>      You'll soon lose sight of the hearty worker but will still      be able to hear it spinning until its complete supply of      body fluids-so magically created from mulberry leaves-is      consumed. If you could see inside the finished case, you'd      find that the once-plump, three-inch-long caterpillar has      been transformed into a shriveled-up pupa of about 1-1/4      inches in length. The entire spinning process takes about      three days, and it's a show that beats the stuffing out of      anything on television!    </p>    <h3>      THE HARVEST, AND AFTER    </h3>    <p>      While the tired pupa turns itself into a moth-a      process that takes from ten days to two weeks-you'll      have a decision to make: If you plan to raise silkworms      again the following year, it'll be necessary to select some      cocoons that will be allowed to complete their life cycles.    </p>    <p>      Naturally, it's necessary to choose a fairly equal number      of males and females to carry on your line, and the best      way to sex these critters is to take a close look at their      protective envelopes. A male produces a structure that      resembles a peanut slightly hour-glass in shape and      somewhat pointed at the ends-while the "ladies" are      most often found in larger, oval-shaped sheaths. Keep in      mind that one moth lays from 300 to 400 eggs, and that 80      or 85% of those will hatch. Two dozen cocoons will,      therefore (assuming that half of them contain females),      yield enough "seed" to hatch about 3,000 crawlers.    </p>        <p>      The nests that you select as your "laying stock" should be      removed from their boxes and set aside in separate, clean,      dry containers. There's no trick to plucking the little      silk houses from their moorings ... just tug 'em gently and      they'll release. (Some waste silk will cling to the box and      cocoon, though. Pull this material loose and save it, as it      can be woven into a beautiful rough cloth called shantung.)    </p>    <p>      Traditionally, the rest of the cocoons which vary in color      from light brown to creamy white ... with a little lemon      and pale green thrown in-are harvested anywhere from      seven to ten days after the caterpillar begins to spin.      It's necessary to kill the pupas inside those nests that      are to be used for silkmaking. (If you don't, the      chrysalids will soon emerge as moths, and-during this      process-the insects produce a solvent which destroys      the continuous filament of the silk fiber.) The easiest way      to accomplish this unpleasant but necessary task is to put      the cocoons in a paper bag and place the sack in a 200°      F oven for 20 minutes. Long exposure-at least six      hours-to bright sun will also do the job.    </p>    <p>      After the pupas are killed, you can relax for a few days      before you reel and spin your silk. But don't rest too      long, or the material will take on a distinctive aroma from      the dead chrysalids inside.    </p>    <p>      And what kind of harvest can you expect ? Well, perhaps not      much the first year (it takes about 2,000 cocoons to      produce a pound of raw silk, and some 350 to make a pair of      stockings! ) but enough of a crop to see whether you really      enjoy the art of sericulture.    </p>    <h3>      MAKE YOUR OWN TOOLS!    </h3>    <p>      One of the great things about harvesting silk is that most      of it can be reeled directly from the cocoons with a simple      homemade tool. Just find yourself two dark-colored pieces      of paperboard-each about 10 inches square-and a      short stick or clothespin. Cut a slot halfway to the center      of each board, and interlock the two sections so they      resemble the paddle wheel of a boat. Then, to make a      "twirling" handle, clip a clothespin just above or below      the intersection of the squares (or cut a slot in a dowel      or stick and slip that handle in place).    </p>    <p>      Next, bring a small pan of water almost to a boil. (If you      use a container with a dark interior, you'll find it easier      to locate the filaments of silk.) When the liquid is ready,      drop five to eight cocoons-depending upon how heavy      you want your thread to be-into the, pan. Most      commercial silk is eight strands thick but five fibers will      also work well because the incredible strength of each      strand is equal to (or greater than) that of a filament of      steel of the same diameter!    </p>    <p>      After a few minutes the water will begin to dissolve the      glue, and you'll see the tiny strings float away from the      cocoons. Use tongs to catch the filaments, and-with one      hand-twist them together in your fingers ... while your      other hand slowly reels the thread onto the paperboard      spool. When you get to the end and the pupas drop into the      water, tie a small knot to keep the thread from unraveling.      (Remember, you'll be winding 600 to 1,000 yards of silk, so      start the job in the morning ... don't wait till an hour or      so before bedtime! )    </p>    <p>      The reward for your (and the silkworms') labor is a thin,      continuous thread of the finest material available. Silk      weighs less than any natural fiber, yet a strand thinner      than a human hair can be stretched five to six inches a      yard and still return to its original length!    </p>    <p>      When we visited Mary Stock, she showed us the ancient art      of "skin spinning" the waste silk. Here's how to do it:      Take a short, straight piece of coat hanger and make a      slight hook (about 1/4 inch Across) at one end. Then, use      this tool to pull at the bundle of raw silk you've      accumulated. As you separate a thin string of fibers from      the mass, roll it on your leg to form a strand (as shown in      the following black-and-white photos). You can also use a      (hop spindle ... or even comb the waste silk with a      cotton-card ing tool and spin it on a wheel. Remember that      silk is an extremely fine fiber, though ... and must be      handled with care.    </p>    <p>      The silkworm's sticky sericin-some of which will      remain on the filaments-makes the thread a bit stiff      and lackluster. However, it's best to weave the silk before      you give it a final wash in mild soap and water to remove      this gluey substance.    </p>    <h3>      A NEW GENERATION    </h3>    <p>      Meanwhile, back at the breeding box, you can watch the      Bombyx m ori-the mulberry or silkworm moth-put      in its brief appearance. The "great awakening" - as      me Chinese called this eventtakes place as the moth      secretes its alkaline saliva ... which softens the end of      the cocoon and allows the adult insect to step into the      world.    </p>    <p>      The wings of the male moth have a dis tinct sickle shape,      and will soon dry and grow as the insect flaps them. The      females can be easily identified by their larger abdomens.      Neither sex able to fly, and the "ladies" rarely stray more      than a few inches from their cocoons.    </p>    <p>      Since the moths are not equipped to eat and sustain      themselves, mating and egg-laying take place soon after      they emerge from their cocoons. Be prepared-by      placing some paper towels in the nest boxes-to remove      the sticky eggs with as little disturbance as possible.      Should a moth lay its tiny treasures on a cocoon, just snip      them off and place 'em with the other eggs dropped (you      hope) on the paper. Then, let ,the new seed dry for a few      days before you store it.    </p>    <p>      Following mating and reproduction, both sexes of moth will      die within a few days ... which brings the silkworm story      full circle. Take the poppy-seed- like eggs and place them      in a small (labeled) jar to be saved-in the crisper      compartment of your refrigerator- for next year's effort.    </p>    <p>      As a potential "worm rancher", you'd probably like to know      what kind of profit you can expect from your work. Well, in      terms of money from the sale of thread, the rewards      probably won't amount to much ... unless you have groves of      mulberry trees and a number of hands to help you out in      spring and early summer. But, on the other hand, so little      silk is produced in North America that the market is wide      open, and there are other ways to turn your hobby into an      income besides selling material!    </p>    <p>      Both Mary Stock and Marguerite Shimmin, for example, find      themselves in great demand for sericulture lectures to      schoolchildren, clubs, and craft groups. Marguerite is      sometimes commissioned by museums to make repairs in old      tapestries, and Mary tells us that her homegrown silk is      snatched up by area weavers for around $35 a pound! So,      despite the time and effort required to grow and harvest      their silk crops, both of these women feel well rewarded      for their labors.    </p>    <p>      In addition to any monetary gains, though, sericulture      offers a rare opportunity to understand the workings of      nature, and a chance to appreciate the time dedication      involved in the mi raculous transformation from "mul berry      leaves [to] satin". For many folks, those will be reasons      enough to give silk worm cultivation a try.    </p>    <h3>      ALL AROUND THE MULBERRY BUSH      ....    </h3>    <p>      If you're interested in pursuing the art of sericulture,      but lack a source of mulberry leaves to feed your      "livestock", you can prepare to start your own silk farm      next year by ordering some seedlings of the necessary tree      now! The Gurney Seed and Nursery Company (Dept. TMEN,      Gurney Building, Yankton, South Dakota 57579) sells three-      to four-foot-high, two-year-old trees for $5.55 apiece or      $24.95 for five ... while J.E. Miller Nurseries, Inc.      (Dept. TMEN, Canandaigua, New York 14424) offers four- to      five-foot, two-year-old trees for $5.45 apiece, or two for      $9.95.    </p>

After 30 days of grazin ~-during which the wrigglers each eat about a quarter pound of leaves and increase their initial weight by 10,000 times! these critters'll encase themselves in robes of silk, producing cocoons a little larger than a quarter. The fat, brown pupa (on the paper towel) that inhabits the cocoon will either be killed-by heating in the oven or (for a longer period of time) in the sun-and its covering harvested ... or the chrysalid will be allowed to hatch into the silkworm moth (again, perched on the leaf). Such adults will soon mate, reproduce, and die ... thereby completing their life cycle (the entirety of which-you'll notice-is shown in this photo!).
