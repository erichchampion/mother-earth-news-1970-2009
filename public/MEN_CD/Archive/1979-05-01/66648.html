                <p>      <em>Veterinarian Randy Kidd - concluding the article      begun in MOTHER NO. 56 - tells you what to do if your      critters are "bugged".<br /></em>    </p>        <p>      Are your porkers growing poorly (or <em>losing</em>      weight)? Do your dairy cows give less milk than they used      to? Does your goat have white gums ... or does your mutt      mope?    </p>    <p>      When such "classic" symptoms show up, most any owner knows      that his or her critters have internal parasites (commonly      called worms). But maybe your animals aren't acting all      that sickly ... perhaps they just look a wee bit listless.      Heck, maybe the beasts even <em>appear</em> to be as happy      as cats in a milking parlor!    </p>    <p>      However, if you read Part I of this article (in MOTHER NO.      56, pages 76-79), you know that healthy-looking livestock      <em>can</em> have serious worm infestations! To put it      simply, parasites are the biggest medical problem we      veterinarians have to face. So I know from experience      thateven when you don't see a single indication of the      internal freeloaders-you can be spending money, building      feeders, raising thoroughbreds, and in general going to a      whole lot of trouble ... all to provide vintage      "pastureland" for some hidden (but enormous) <em>herds of      worms!</em>    </p>    <h3>      KNOW YOUR ENEMY (THE ESSENTIAL PARASITE      PRIMER)    </h3>    <p>      You should understand- <em>before you</em> start      tackling these foes-just what parasites do and where      they come from. Worms-slimy "spelunkers" that range      from microscopic to <em>yardstick</em> size-can      invade almost every animal organ. The uninvited visitors      will clog hearts, coat stomachs, cause acute bellyaches,      block blood circulation, eat your stock's food <em>(or</em>      innards), and-in some instanceskill the" hosts" they      inhabit.    </p>    <p>      What's more, the freeloading vermin can strike at any one      of several stages in their life cycle. In fact, immature      larvae sometimes cause more harm than do "adult" worms ...      while seemingly harmless parasite eggs can lie dormant      around the place for years, just waiting for the right      environment (like ol' Bossy's belly) to come along.    </p>    <p>      These pests can also attack your animals in a number of      ways. Some worm types are handed down-like family      curses-through the mother's placenta (or in her      milk). Flies can deposit eggs in your pet's fur, mosquitoes      can inject the pests into a critter's bloodstream ... or      your beast may simply <em>eat</em> an insect or rodent      that's serving as a parasite "halfway house".    </p>    <p>      But (pay attention now) the absolute, number one,      <em>main</em> way that animals get worms is through      exposure to parasite eggs in the beasts' own manure (and to      the small bugs, snails, and slugs that feed on that      manure). I can't emphasize this truth too strongly: If your      horse, cow, or whatever can <em>smell</em> its own dung,      the animal is going to get worms.    </p>    <p>      All these discouraging facts about parasites should lead      you to a couple of basic conclusions. One is that you will      NEVER eliminate all worms-or the threat of      them-from your pets and livestock. And the other is      that you can-and certainly <em>should</em> -      <em>do everything</em> within your power to control the      pests.    </p>    <p>      And the best way I know to cut down your parasite      population is to consistently follow Dr. Kidd's famous      (well, it sure oughta be):    </p>    <h3>      FIVE-POINT PARASITE CONTROL PROGRAM    </h3>    <p>      POINT 1: <em>There is a wealth of wisdom in keeping your      critters healthy. A</em> good diet, fresh water, clean      shelter, adequate bedding, and a bit of affection now and      then will help your animals resist worms, and other      diseases as well (just as these same preventive measures      work for you).    </p>    <p>      POINT 2: <em>Graze your grass gracious</em> ly. A pasture      rotation plan will protect your livestock from constant      exposure to their own droppings ... and, therefore, make      the critters a lot less likely to become infested with      worms. The wandering quadrupeds will also eat better, which      (as I said in Point 1) will help make them more disease and      parasite resistant.    </p>    <p>      POINT 3: <em>Manage your manure.</em> Clean all animal      living quarters <em>every day ...</em> and do the job      right. As we say around the Kidd barn, if you can't sit in      it (the stall, that is), it ain't clean.    </p>    <p>      POINT 4: <em>Pickle those parasites with the proper      parasiticide.</em> Identify your worm problems, then      ROUTINELY AND CONSISTENTLY attack them with an effective      anthelmintic. Consistency is important ... because the      medicine may knock out all the mature worms in one      application but leave the <em>larvae</em> unscathed. It      takes repeated treatments to catch all the developing      "waves" of worms.    </p>    <p>      POINT 5: <em>Analyze your efforts.</em> Have a veterinarian      run fecal checks <em>at least</em> once a year ... two      months or more after your last anthelmintic treatment (so      the vermicide has had a chance to wear off). What the yet      learns-when he or she examines the small, fresh sample      droppings you bring-will tell you how well (or how      poorly) your treatment attempts are going. The manure test      will also let you know exactly which parasites you have to      fight in the first place. (By the way, <em>one</em> sample      from each <em>kind</em> of animal you raise will be plenty      ... you won't need to cart in a collection of the pungent      pellets,)    </p>    <h3>      ANTHELMINTIC CAUTIONS    </h3>    <p>      All right, you've taken care of your animal's pastureland,      stall, and general well-being, and you've <em>also</em>      taken your manure tidbits down to a vet and had that doctor      analyze your worms. At last the two of you are equipped to      pick out a real parasite-walloping vermicide.    </p>    <p>      (NOTE: This article will give you general information that      can help you understand what you <em>and your vet</em> are      doing ... it <em>will not</em> teach you how to choose your      own anthelmintic. However, if you do unsuccessfully try a      do-it-yourself treatment anyway-and then end up      consulting a "heifer healer"-PLEASE be kind enough to      tell the doctor what medication you used. It may help him      or her save your critter's life.)    </p>    <p>      The type of anthelmintic that you and your doc should      choose is one that is safe, economical, easy-to-use, and      eliminates many kinds of parasites (a broad-spectrum      anthelmintic). Most of the newer "scattershot" wormers      satisfy these characteristics.    </p>    <p>      But, before you administer a ny anthelmintic,      please-for the sake of your beasts' (and your own)      health-take the following precautions:    </p>    <p>      KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING ... READ AND REREAD THE DIRECTIONS      ON THE MEDICINE'S LABEL UNTIL YOU THOROUGHLY UNDERSTAND      THEM.    </p>    <p>      USE THE CORRECT DOSAGE- It Is possible to actually      kill an animal if you use too much parasiticide or give the      medicine too often. Twice as much is NOT twice as good.    </p>    <p>      BE PARTICULARLY CAUTIOUS ABOUT USING ANTHELMINTICS ON SICK      ANIMALS, YOUNG ANIMALS, PREGNANT ANIMALS, OR LACTATING      ANIMALS (critters giving milk).    </p>    <p>      DON'T DRINK ANY MILK FROM A PARASITICIDE-TREATED ANIMAL      UNTIL <em>ALL</em> TRACES OF THE DRUG ARE GONE FROM THE      BEAST'S MILK. Your vet can tell you the "withdrawal time"      for a specific anthelmintic.    </p>    <p>      DON'T ADMINISTER ANTHELMINTICS IN YOUR LIVESTOCK'S FEED      UNLESS YOU CAN BE ABSOLUTELY CERTAIN THAT EACH AND EVERY      ANIMAL EATS ITS "CHOW" AND GETS ITS FAIR SHARE-AND      ONLY ITS SHARE-OF THE MEDICINE.    </p>    <p>      Once you've absorbed all those precautionary words, you'll      be ready to help your <em>animals</em> absorb something ...      namely, a good, broad-spectrum worm medication. Because      this whole disease and treatment topic can get pretty      danged complicated, I've worked up an easy-to-read      anthelmintics chart to accompany this article. The table      lists some common parasites, appropriate vermicides, and      sound treatment programs for the standard homestead      livestock and pets.    </p>    <p>      Remember that-by necessity-all the information      I'm giving you is very <em>general.</em> There're plenty of      good anthelminties that I won't be mentioning ... and new      ones are being developed all the time. Your own vet will      know which particular worm killers work best for your      specific parasites. (After all, the area where you live may      have entirely different worms from my home territory.)    </p>    <p>      Oh, and one last thing. To keep these pages squeezed down      to one article (instead of letting them fill out the whole      magazine), I've only mentioned a few of the many varieties      of parasites. I sincerely hope that any worm whose name I      leave out will forgive me. Lord knows, I don't need any      worms mad at me.    </p>    <h3>      RUMINANTS    </h3>    <p>      Cattle, sheep, and goats are all ruminants ... that is,      animals with four stomachs (their habit of chewing their      own cud gives us that word for pondering and repondering a      thought, <em>ruminating).</em> These contemplative gnawers      can get infested with a page-filling list of internal      parasites ... but fortunately, most mod ern broad-spectrum      anthelmintics are effective against all sorts of uninvited      ruminant "guests".    </p>    <p>      One nasty disease that <em>immature</em> ruminants      sometimes catch is called coccidiosis. The frisky young'uns      will probably shake off this single-celled parasite on      their own if they get some sunshine and adequate pasture      room. But coccidiosis <em>can</em> be fatal. Personally, I      wouldn't wait around to see whether the critters drop the      bug or the bug drops them. If your newborns get the      "runs"-or if your herd has had coccidiosis problems      in the past-treat the cudchewing youngsters quickly.      In fact, a sensible preventive measure would be to take a      fecal sample from <em>any</em> newborn ruminant to your vet      for analysis.    </p>    <p>      Now, I'll tell you a bit more about each of these barnyard      beasties.    </p>    <p>      CATTLE. As the chart shows, all cattle should be wormed      three to four times a year, beginning when they are about      one month old. Of course, you won't have any trouble      medicating the dairy mooers you handle every day ... but it      isn't so easy to treat freeroaming beef cattle. Some of      those nomadic hoofers get pretty "unhumanized", and trying      to hold them still-long enough to, say, squirt a      thiabendizole paste on their tongues-is about as easy      as shampooing a porcupine. <em>[EDITOR'S NOTE: Randy</em>      wrote <em>about proper handling techniques in "Restrain      That Beast", MOTHER NO. 52, pages 84-87. / You'll</em>      probably have to settle for worming the beef critters      whenever you've got them restrained for some other reason      (like castration or vaccination).    </p>        <p>      Mother cows should be treated with anthelmintics just      before they calve (to prevent them from passing the worms      to their offspring) and again 90 days later. Paste or bolus      (big pill) forms work well. Remember ... don't drink any of      your cow's milk until the time period during which the      vermicide can be detected in the milk is over, Also, be      sure (by following your vet's advice) that the parasiticide      you use won't ''dry up" your cow and make her stop      producing milk.    </p>    <p>      SHEEP. Parasitism is the number one health problem in sheep      ... and is directly related to how well they are fed, so it      pays to indulge the appetites of your woolly friends. Sheep      worms also experience spring rise . . . in other words, the      pests really come out swinging after winters over.      Therefore, don't forget to give your flock-every      year-a thorough intestinal "spring cleaning".    </p>    <p>      COATS. These are such argumentative creatures that adding      the anthelmintic to their feed-and making certain      each one eats a fair share-is probably the easiest      way to worm your Nannies and Billies. The feeding technique      is made especially convenient by the fact that most      broadrange worm medicines come in easy-to-eat granular and      liquid forms.    </p>    <h3>      HORSES    </h3>    <p>      Horses can carry a cavalry of internal riders . . . so many      that you may need to worm the steeds pretty clanged      steadinessly just to stay on top of their parasite      problems. That's one reason why I put such a long list of      horse anthelmintics on the bug-and-drug chart: so you can      switch your "weaponry" often enough to keep the vermin from      developing a resistance to any one medication. (The other      reason is that-since you don't milk horses-you can use a      greater variety of anthelmintics on them than can safely be      administered to ruminants.)    </p>    <p>      Among the nastiest of the equestrian parasites are the      larvae of the strongyle bloodworms. These "bugs" migrate      into the arteries that supply the small intestine, and thus      the parasites can actually block off some of a horse's      blood flow ... causing acute intestinal pain (colic).    </p>    <p>      Bots (the larvae of the Gasterophilus fly) are an equally      nagging juvenile invader. The hardcoated, sluglike shysters      can cover almost the entire surface of a horse's stomach.      Horses ingest the parasites by innocently chewing or      licking the spotlike-and visible to the human eyeeggs ...      which flies deposit on the critters' slick coats.    </p>    <p>      And-just in case you haven't heard enough equine      afflictions-another horse worm you can sometimes see      is the Oxyur s, or pinworm. These lower intestine burrowers      may actually crawl out of your steed's backside. If your      horse has a ratty tail (because the animal's been      scratching its southbound end a lot), this pointy parasite      may be the reason.    </p>    <h3>      HOGS    </h3>    <p>      Since animals that have contact with their own manure are      most likely to get worms, pigs-which are renowned for      living the "sty life"-get plenty of parasites. I've      filled a quart mason jar with the worms removed from just      one sow! To keep your swine fine and healthy, you'll have      to worm the creatures on a regular basis. And-because      the porky "garbage disposals" will consume almost      anything-the simplest way to get an anthelmintic into      a pig's stomach is just to add the medicine to its food.    </p>    <h3>      DOGS    </h3>    <p>      Almost all puppies are born with some kind-and often      lots of kinds-of worms. So be sure to treat your      canine babiesand your expectant dog      mothers-conscienously. Piperazine is a common      roundworm medicine that works well (remember, it only kills      mature roundworms, so you have to use it repeatedly). But      piperazine is a specific-not a      broadspectrum-anthelmintic and won't affect any other      worms your pups may be harboring.    </p>    <p>      Hookworms are a very severe example of those "other'' dog      botherers. These "vampires" enter by penetrating the skin      and can drain enough blood to make the pups anemic ... or      even kill them. Check young dogs-at four to six weeks      of age-for this intestinal parasite (or even sooner      after birth if you've had hookworm troubles in the past).    </p>    <p>      Another common canine parasite-found in dogs of all      ages-is the tapeworm. Dogs catch these well-named      (they may be five feet long) scoundrels in two ways. The      Taenia tapeworm larvae inhabit the body of a rabbit or      rodent, so-if your hound likes to eat wild critters      out back-it may well already be hosting this pest.      And <em>Dipylidium</em> tapeworm eggs use fleas as their      "pass card" for intestinal entrance. When your canine      chews-and accidentally swallows-an aggravating      skin-biter, the pooch's aggravation may have just begun.    </p>    <p>      You can tell if Fido has either variety of tapeworm by      looking for white, rice like worm segments in your dog's      feces. If you see these egg-harboring body pieces, medicate      your dog immediately. However, don't use one of the older      tapeworm remedies. Those outmoded anthel mintics knock off      most of the tape<br />      worm's body (the segments will dramatically appear in the      dog's waste ), but the parasite's many-hooked head remains      embedded in your suffering pooch's intestinal wall ... to      grow and strike again. The newer remedies "go for the      jugular" and kill the tapeworm's head (some even dissolve      the whole "measure" so you won't see any segments passed in      the animal's feces at all). Niclosamide is a very effective      and safe example of the more modern drugs available (this      medicine is a specific anthelmintic against the flea-spread      Dipylidium tapeworm.)    </p>    <p>      One canine problem you definitely should not treat at home      is heartworms. These mosquitospread larvae mature into      spaghetti- strand monsters right in the chambers of your      dog's heart ... and inhibit the pumping of the blood in      this dangerously hard-to-treat organ. So try to prevent the      problem before it starts by finding out-from your      vet-if heartworms are prevalent in your area and what      you can do to prevent them (the test for these parasites is      done from a blood-rather than a fecal-sample).    </p>    <h3>      CATS    </h3>    <p>      Cats can get most of the same parasites that dogs do,      but-because of Tabby's renowned (and effective)      cleaning habits-felines have a lot less worm trouble      than most other specks. One parasite that can easily      trouble cats, though, is tapeworms (cats get'em just as      dogs do, by eating animals or swallowing fleas). In      fact-if fleas are a big item in your area-you      may need to treat your eat for tapeworms every month.    </p>    <h3>      ONE MORE ONCE    </h3>    <p>      What I'm trying to get across by telling you these      discomforting facts is just how fortunate we are today.      Many of the anthelmintics available now arc safe (WHEN USED      CORRECTLY) and are effective. So don't let parasites drain      your critters (and your pocketbook).    </p>    <p>      I've written this message so many times that my pen is      winded, but <em>dammit</em> , it's true ... you      <em>can</em> solve your parasite problems! You just have to      stick-conscientiously-to the first three points      of the PARASITE CONTROL PROGRAM ... and then periodically      use an efficient anthelmintic.    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      MORE HOME VETERINARY CARE INFORMATION    </h3>    <p>      Further information about how you can keep your farm      animals and house pets healthy can be found in the      following sources:    </p>    <p>      1."
