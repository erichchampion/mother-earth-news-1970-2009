                    <p>      <em><strong>Wild food enthusiast Jhon E.Traister came home      empty-handed time and time again, until the forager finally      he was being...</strong></em>    </p>        <p>      Ol' Euell Gibbons "stalked" all the asparagus he could eat,      and some of my best friends seem to gather the tasty      vegetable by the <em>cord.</em> Unfortu nately, neither      Gibbons' inspiration nor my buddies' encouragement seemed      to help me. I searched for the elusive 'gras spears for      many a spring, but-no matter how far I roamed or how      doggedly I scoured the ground-my gatherin' sack      always remained empty.    </p>    <h3>      ASPARAGUS FINDS<em>ME!</em>    </h3>    <p>      Then one May morning-as I was mowing the far corner      of a too-long-neglected lawn-I started to get a very      <em>peculiar</em> feeling. Call it a wild food lover's      sixth sense, <em>deja vu,</em> or just a gnat buzzing in my      ear ... whatever the unusual sensation was, it kept coming      back to me every time I went past that one bend. Well, when      I get an itch I scratch it ... so on the next circuit I      stopped my grass cutter and took a look.    </p>        <p>      Right away, some dead plant stalks caught my eye. The dried      "sticks" stood out from the rest of last year's weeds      because they were light-almost tan-in color,      and because each one consisted of a single, half-inch      "trunk" with a few scrawny branches dangling from its      sides. The three-foot-tall stems looked like pitiful      excuses for needleless, discarded Christmas trees. But,      clustered at the base of these "Yuletide rejects" were      bunches of firm, young asparagus shoots! At last I'd found      the evasive little vegetables ... and right in my own back      yard,too!    </p>    <h3>      KNOW YOUR QUARRY    </h3>        <p>      Now, I've told you about my plant-finding experience to      show that [1] there may be lots of asparagus growing right      under your nose, and [2] you can find your own supply of      tasty spears ... I you know what to look for! Or, rather,      if you learn how <em>not</em> to search for these foraged      delicacies.    </p>    <p>      <em>Don't,</em> for example, hunt-with your eyes      glued to the ground-for the "l'il sprouts" themselves:      Those purplishgreen babies may be dwarfed by other plant      growth or hiding under old leaves. Instead, learn to      recognize the tall, dried stalks (which are all that      remains of last year's mature plants). You'll find plenty      of 6- to 10-inch goodies nestled under these easily      observed " signal f lags' ".    </p>    <p>      To be successful, you'll have to know <em>exactly</em> what      those stalks look like. Andalthough the photos and      descriptions in this article can help-the <em>best</em> way      to sharpen your asparagus- spotters is to actually see some      plants "in the flesh". So if you know a friendly forager,      get him or her to take you out for a lookin' lesson.    </p>    <p>      On the other hand, maybe a neighbor of yours has grown a      patch of 'gras in his or her vegetable garden for the past      few seasons. If so, last year's shriveled-up asparagus      leftovers are probably still standing around the plot. Go      sit yourself down in front of those dead stalks for a few      minutes and <em>memorize</em> their features. Don't fret      that you may be examining some tame variety that won't look      at all like the "woolly" breed you're out to capture ...      because wild and cultivated asparagus are one and the same      plant <em>(Asparagus officinalis,</em> literally "shoot      used as medicine"). Seed-spreading birds once helped some      garden specimens "escape from civilization", and now the      hardy perennial ranges all over the country.    </p>    <h3>      "PLANTING" AHEAD    </h3>        <p>      If-after all your stalk studies-you still come      up empty-plattered this spring, the asparagus plants you      missed will grow past the shoot-eating stage and mature      into tall stalks. But don't stop looking! Any "grown-ups"      you find in July will give you succulent sprouts ... when      you come back to the "marked" spot the following spring.    </p>    <p>      The summer plants have the same tapering- toward- the-top,      feathery branch design as dead spring stems do, but still.      growing stalks are green in color, and their sparse sprigs      are flecked with tiny hairlike leaves (the wispy fronds are      often used for decoration in table bouquets). Pollinating      plants also develop small, drooping, greenish-white flowers      that each yield-by fall-a single, bright red      berry (which harbors the seeds that the birds spread).    </p>    <p>      Of course, chances are-with the kind of "training"      that I've described-you'll End yourself up to your      ankles in good eatin' <em>this</em> spring. Because, once      you've learned to identify asparagus plants, you'll be      amazed at how easy the young shoots are to find! Field      borders, the sides of old railroad tracks, or any open      areas with good soil and sun are likely to contain thriving      "plots" that you can return to again and again (just pick      all the young spears, and their persistent roots will send      up new ones)!    </p>    <p>      In fact, nowadays I just position my two children by the      car's rear windows, drive down littletraveled country      lanes, and let the young'uns shout out the roadside patches      as we roll along. No sir, I no longer worry about having to      "stalk" asparagus . . . 'cause these plants are so      plentiful that it seems like <em>they're</em> stalking me!    </p>    <h3>      GOT THE FORAGIN' FEVER?    </h3>    <p>      Want to learn more about finding and cooking wild foods?

Box 70, Hendersonville, North      Carolina 28739.    </p>		<hr />    <h3>      SWEET EATS WITH ASPARAGUS TREATS    </h3>    <p>      When you've finally herded up a pail of fresh little      asparagus shoots (you can help tenderize any tough, woody,      older stalks by peeling them), it's time to pull on an      apron and set in to cooking, Of course, the easiest way to      fix your vegetables is to just "bile up and butter" (or      better yet, steam to the right consistency) a plateful, but      the scrumptious spikes will easily lend themselves to all      sorts of other good-eating treatments, too!    </p>    <p>      If you'd like to serve a juicy asparagus hors d'oeuvre, for      instance, simply wrap each cooked spear with a piece of      buttered sandwich bread and hold the appetizers together      with toothpicks.    </p>    <p>      Or, how about a dish of asparagus "popcorn"? To start this      eye-opener, slice your raw stalks on the extreme bias,      about a quarter-inch thick. Then heat 1 tablespoon of olive      oil and a bit of ginger (like asparagus, ginger can be      found "free for the foraging") in a skillet. Throw in 3      cups of the lean vegetable pieces, Wong with a couple      dashes of salt and pepper Turn the heat up to -high", put a      lid on the pan . . . and start shaking! In about four      minutes, this old popcorn-cooking technique will give      you-and yours-some mighty crisp eating!    </p>    <p>      The "free-food" gourmet's delight, however, just about has      to be Bily Joe's Asparagus Pie (reprinted here-with      the permission of Workman Publishing Company, New      York-from Billy Joe Tatum's <em>Wild Foods Cookbook      & Field Guide, copy</em> right Â© 1976 by Billy Joe      Tatum). To make this delicacy, you'll first have to      bake-and set aside-your own favorite pie shell      recipe. Then-to make a white sauce-melt 3      tablespoons of butter, blend in 3 tablespoons of flour, and      add 1 cup of hot milk (stir the mixture continuously for 5      to 10 minutes until it thickens). When this "gravy" is      ready, mix in a couple of chicken-or vegetable- bouillon      cubes (these are optional), 1 tablespoon of minced chives,      and salt and pepper to taste.    </p>    <p>      Next, add 4 cups of cooked, 1-inch asparagus pieces and 4      chopped, hardboiled eggs. Pour this finished filling into      your baked pie shell and sprinkle the top with 1/2 cup of      shredded cheddar cheese. Finally, slide this beautiful      master work into a 400Â°F oven for 10 minutes (or until      the cheese begins to brown), and then (what are you waiting      for?) dig in!    </p>
