                <p>      <strong>COUNTRY SKILLS</strong>    </p>    		<h5 id="byline">	      By John Vivian    </h5>    <p>      <em>Finding your Farmall, "Johnny Popper," Oil-Pull,      Fordson, or Rumely ... for less.</em>    </p>        <p>      It's been almost 30 years now since I gave up trying to      grow tomatoes on a city-apartment balcony and went looking      for a country place. What sold me on my first old farmstead      weren't so much the overgrown fields begging to produce      again, the sucker-filled but stillbearing fruit trees, or      the antique stone house and barn ...but the tractor and      implements that went with it (for an added $2,500). The      tractor was a gorgeous little Farmall "A," its paint shiny      bright red, original decals intact, the huge lugged tires      barely worn, and the muffler just rusted enough to look      serious. Lined up behind it along the back of the barn were      a stake-bed trailer on an old Ford axle, an antique snow      plow, a single-bottom land plow, a 3-gang disc harrow, a      fertilizing corn drill, and a sickle-bar mower with a      wooden crank arm - all of them in perfect condition.      And in the toolbox in the footwell of the tractor was the      original owner's manual ...dated 1939!    </p>    <p>      The "A" had a new-looking Exide battery under the seat,      plus a generator and starter motor, but I was all eager to      try the crank. I checked oil and water, turned the valve      under the gas tank on, turned the rotary ignition switch      off, advanced the lever-and-quadrant hand throttle to the      middle notch, pulled up on the choke nob, put the lovely      long shift lever into neutral, and - hands shaking      like a kid with a new tricycle - poked the crank into      the hole under the grille in front.    </p>    <p>      My farming Great-Uncle Will had taught me how to      crank-start decades earlier by spinning the big flywheel of      "Johnny Popper," his Kermit-the-Frog-green John Deere. I      grasped the crankhandle palm open so's not to break a thumb      or worse if she backfired - something that can happen      if you forget to retard spark on an old engine that gets      its ignition charge from a manual timing-adjusted magneto.      This Farmall had a magneto to provide spark, but since it      had no spark-advance/retard lever beside the throttle lever      or at the magneto, I assumed it was equipped with a modern      self-retarding distributor head. Pulling up hard in the      only direction the crank would catch, I pulled the engine      through twice, then switched her on and cranked again. The      stout little 4-banger popped, but that's all.    </p>    <p>      Recalling Uncle Will's directions for starting a cold,      hand-cranked engine on a hot, humid summer day, I drained      the sediment bowl under the fuel tank to get rid of any      water in the gas, opened choke and closed throttle, and      pulled her around several times to clear the cylinders and      plugs. Then, decreasing both choke and throttle from      earlier settings, I cranked again. She fired on the second      crank, and after blowing a little more gray-blue smoke,      began to chug happily. I climbed up into the dished-steel      "hot seat" (an old tractor's transmission can heat up and      toast your backside while the sun tans your top over a      summer-day's work). I closed choke, adjusted speed, threw      out the clutch, searched around for first, and eased up on      the go-pedal. The little Farmall lurched and barely inched      forward, so I threw the clutch again, fished around for      second gear, let up easy on the clutch, and rolled out into      the sunshine.    </p>    <p>      Was I on top of the world, or what? No longer an overpaid      paper-pusher in an overpriced three-button suit, I was      transformed into a plain but honest man of the soil -      sturdy and self-reliant - sitting high up, free and      in the wind on a real, honest-to-God farm tractor. Every      boy-homesteader's dream, right?    </p>    <p>      <strong>ON TOP OF THE WORLD</strong><br />      Well, yes. But try as I might, I couldn't get that gorgeous      little Farmall "A" tractor to work quite right.    </p>    <h3>      But How Does It Work?    </h3>    <p>      Well, yes. But try as I might, I couldn't get it to work      right. The tractor had a drawbar at the rear. The plow      tongue attached to it with a pintle hook and trailed fine,      but there was no way to exert significant down-pressure or      keep the toe of the plow down. Even when I hand dug a      starting furrow, I never figured out the knack of guiding      and keeping it biting from my perch on the seat, having not      yet realized that the concrete blocks piled in a corner of      the pasture were needed for weight, so it just skipped over      the weeds. I had a lot of fun flushing pheasants and      chasing cottontails around in the fields, though.    </p>    	    <p>      I figured that the plowing might go easier if I mowed the      goldenrod, burdock, and young poplars that were invading      the fields. The sicklebar mounted up and ran with a      satisfying click-click, but I couldn't get it to cut      through the saplings. (Had I persisted I'd have broken all      the teeth on the reciprocating cutter bar. I needed a      brushhog - a monster-mower that slings a heavy steel      flail through most anything that grows - but I didn't      even know what that was.)    </p>    <p>      So, I paid a neighbor to hog off, plow, double-disc, and      harrow-smooth the best field with his big modern tractor,      then had a great time drilling in a fancy hybrid field      corn. Along with the wildly expensive sacks of seed corn,      the co-op gave me a stake and a metal sign with a      lithograph of a half-shucked goldenyellow ear with the      proud name, Dekalb, under it to put out on the road. I      still have that sign somewhere.    </p>    <p>      What little of the corn I managed to drill deep enough that      the crows couldn't get it, but not so deep it was lost in      darkness forever, germinated in a week. The rabbits began      nipping off each night's growth at ground level each      morning. I tried chucking rocks at the fuzzy-tailed little      monsters as I left for the city each morning, but it was      hopeless. Having been plowed up, divided, replanted, and      fertilized, the weeds reestablished with renewed vigor and      choked out what the wildlife had left of my corn while I      ran all over looking (alas, too late) for a cultivator      frame and corn spades to fit a '39 "A." I tried      hand-cultivating but after a week of rain couldn't find the      rabbit-nipped stumps of new-planted corn in the "old      growth" weeds. ln three weeks the pheasants and quail had      moved back in and I sent off for a book on raising wildfowl      for the wing-shooting market.    </p>    <p>      To save time, I hand-dug the vegetable garden, while the      tractor rested snug in the barn. It always popped on the      first crank and started on the second, and I had great fun      hooking up the trailer and giving visiting city folks a      real, bumpy, country hayride.    </p>        <p>      Had I worked at it, I'm sure I could have mastered tractor,      weeds, and varmints. But in those days, the farm was my      escape from work - certainly a more productive use of      leisure time than watching pro football on the tube, but      recreation just the same. And, when I finally quit the      fasttrack and left the high-rent district to go      homesteading for real, everything but a '52 Ford pickup and      a few practical essentials was converted to cash. Including      the "A." It broke my heart and I dream about that little      tractor to this day. Gosh it was pretty! But, it was more      important to be mortgage-free than keep a pet tractor.    </p>    <p>      And that's what old tractors are for most of us -      pets. Not toys; that's too frivolous. But, seldom are they      money-making agricultural machinery either. With a few      exceptions, such as growing premium or organic produce,      "pick-your-own" small fruits and such, commercial farming      has become a mechanized industry requiring vast amounts of      land and gigantic articulated-steering turbo-diesel      tractors with air-conditioned cabs equipped with TV sets      ...that cost $50,000 and up. Today's corporate farmer is a      heavy-equipment operator who knows more about hydraulics      and diesel turbochargers than soil. Most "family farmers"      who persist in cultivating small acreage with old equipment      work off-farm "to support the tractor" as they put it. What      they mean, of course, is that it's worth working two jobs      to keep the land in production and in the family rather      than selling it off for a shopping mall or condos,      permitting at least one more generation to live the good      life on the farm. God bless.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SMALL-SCALE MODELS</strong><br />      Today's corporate farmer is really a heavy-equipment      operator and seldom uses old "pet" tractors.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Every Countryman Needs a Tractor</strong>    </p>    <p>      The tractor confirms a commitment to a life on the land and      to serious agriculture. (So what if you're husbanding two      and a half acres of sand, scrub oak, and Johnson grass      rather than 2,500 acres of prime Kansas wheatland?) It is      the modern counterpart of the mythic cowboy's cayuse,      General Patton's Sherman tank, or Peter Fonda's      Captain-America Harley.    </p>    <p>      I'd put a good used tractor in the same expenditure      category as your daughter's 15-year-old saddle pony. The      price of a well-experienced horse or tractor is about the      same, their housing requirements are the same, vet and shop      bills the same. A small bale of first-cutting hay and a      gallon of gas even cost the same, a dollar and change. You      spend about the same amount of time riding around on them      too - not as much as you'd like. Neither accomplishes      a lot that can't be hired out cheaper and quicker, but      they're as much part of country life as your huge,      endearing fool of a dog or a vegetable garden that produces      three times what you need.    </p>    <p>      So, be sure the barn roof's sound, the wood's split and      stacked, the garden's weed-free, and the kids have their      braces. Then, you can have yourself some real fun and go      looking at tractors, talking tractors, and test-driving      tractors. Visit all the local farm equipment dealers and      farm-town service stations. Drive the country roads looking      in farmhouse front yards for tractors with FOR SALE signs      hanging off the radiator. Check the classifieds in      country-town papers, in "Weekly Shopper" and "Want Ad"      periodicals, in old-car magazines, and tabloids. Look at      the bulletin boards at supermarkets, the VFW, the Fish      & Gun Club, the Odd Fellows, and the Grange Hall, as      well as at all the local hardware, feed stores, and the      farm co-op.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A Brief History</strong>    </p>    <p>      Here are some of the fine old tractors you are likely to      find, arranged on a timeline in the order that major      features were developed.    </p>    <p>      <em>Steam-Traction Engines</em>    </p>    <p>      As early as the 1850s, farmer cops of a sort were hoisting      Mr. Watt's steam engines onto horse-drawn wagons and      hauling them from farm to farm to power threshing machines.      The year 1876 saw the first steam-traction farm engine: A      small railroad locomotive, really, fitted with      self-steering front wheels in place of the cowcatcher and      rail-truck, and tall, wide cleated-steal ground wheels in      back in place of the big, half-flanged drivers. A steamer      could haul a barn clear across Kansas (and did so as a      publicity stunt), or pull a gang of a dozen moldboard plows      through 6-foot-deep prairie sod. But it cost a small      fortune to purchase them, required a crew to run them, and      they were too low and unwieldy to cultivate standing crops      or even turn around at the head end of farm felds laid out      for draft animals. Plus, they sank to the firebox in soft      soil and stalled on low hills. You can still find their      hulks scattered throughout the grain belt, rusting silently      where they were pulled off into fence rows, or anchoring a      small, tree-grown oasis in the center of the field where      they quit for the last time. You can usually get one for      the hauling or for scrap-iron value. Restore and sell it if      you like for $1.50/pound and up. But don't plan to drive it      in the July 4th parade. Ten-plus tons of cast iron on      cleated-steel wheels can fracture concrete and leave      trench-like ruts in summer-warmed asphalt.    </p>    <p>      <em>Mechanical Mule</em>    </p>    <p>      Initially, the tractor was conceived as a direct mechanical      replacement for a mule or a team of draft animals and a      wagon. Four low wheels were placed at the corners of a      rectangular iron ladder frame, with the pulling power in      front and the driver in back. This was plenty good enough      back when a man could raise a family off "40 acres and a      mule" - even if another farm hand had to walk along      behind to guide a land plow, or sit on the bouncing seat of      a wheeled hay rake to dump it periodically. Like a mule, an      early tractor would go forward and back if it felt like it,      pulling implements fastened to the drawbar with a chain,      pintle hook, or hitch.    </p>    <p>      But, cute as it may be, any tractor designed in the      midteens or earlier is an example of primitive automotive      technology - with a two-band clutch, sparktube      ignition, once-through lubrication, thermosiphon gravity      cooling, a hit-and-miss governor, and by-guess-and-by-God      gear-selection. It is better suited to the annual Steam      Engine & Old Tractor Festival or Drum & Belt      Threshing Bee than to serious farm use. Put another way,      like all engine-powered machines of the day, really old      farm tractors are prone to break down at the worst possible      moment. Farmers detested them, especially the badly      balanced Fordson built by Henry and Edsel Ford. But they      were still faster and cheaper than a team of horses.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A PART OF FARM HISTORY:</strong><br />      The tractor is the farmer's modern counterpart of the      mythic cowboy's cayuse, General Patton's Sherman tank, or      Peter Fonda's "Captain-America" Harley.    </p>    <p>      <em>Power Takeoff</em>    </p>    <p>      To export their power, the old steamers and early      gas/kerosene tractors sported a large drum on one end of      the crank-shaft that extended out of both sides of the      engine (a big flywheel was fastened to the other side). The      drum was fitted with a hideously dangerous wide-leather or      canvas belt that ran around drums on stationary threshing      machines and corn shellers.    </p>    <p>      The year 1919 saw the first tractor that might fill an      everyday role on a modern homestead. International      Harvester's Model "A" General-Purpose Tractor offered the      first genuine power takeoff (PTO) with a flexible arm      linking engine and accessory that could transfer engine      power to mobile implements.    </p>    <p>      <em>Electricals</em>    </p>    <p>      In 1920, automotive batteries and generators were adapted      to operate tractors' lights and engine starters. (And was I      glad for the electric starter on my "A" when going out to      plow snow in a 5°F blizzard.)    </p>    <p>      <em>Hydraulics</em>    </p>    <p>      Hydraulics first appeared on wheeled tractors in the 1934      Deere Model "AN." Fast-wearing mechanical linkages were      replaced by hydraulic pistons actuated by non-compressible      fluid that was pressurized by a tractor-powered pump and      carried through flexible hose. Pistons could be bolted on      anywhere to raise and lower heavy cultivators, plows,      rakes, or lifting booms smoothly and effortlessly. They      could make buckets scoop and remote hydraulic pistons and      motors could extend power well beyond the tractor's frame      - to saws and log splitters, rotary tillers, and      hay-bale elevators. My "A" lacked hydraulics. But if she'd      had them (and if I'd had any sense), I'd have kept her and      saved the expense of providing individual power and      hydraulics for the big cordwood buzz saw, log splitter,      garden tiller, and more.    </p>    <p>      <em>Three-Point Hitch</em>    </p>    <p>      The '36 Ferguson-Brown introduced the three-point hitch      - another simple but brilliant bit of creative      engineering that combined the strongest form in nature, the      triangle, with the most efficient forcemultiplier,      leverage; with the most efficient force-transfer principle,      hydraulics. (I use it to convince the kids that science and      math really do have uses once you get out of school.) An      implement, such as a plow, is bolted to two shafts attached      at each side of the bottom rear of the transmission and to      a single shaft attached to a hydraulic piston fastened at      the top. The piston raises and lowers the plow, applies      tractor-weight down-pressure and adjusts depth - all      controlled with one lever.    </p>    <p>      <em>Modern Features</em>    </p>    <p>      In 1946 a separate implement clutch was developed so a      "live" PTO could be run independent of main transmission      and clutch. In the late-middle-'50s, tractor-makers adopted      "on-the-go" and automatic shifting. Ford made power      steering standard in 1956, and by the late '60s, tractors      were thoroughly modern machines that looked and functioned      and cost more like the tractor of an 18-wheeler than one of      the true farm tractors built between '20 and '55.    </p>    <p>      But, unless you have the time and mechanical aptitude to      teach yourself to pour Babbit-metal bearings, maintain      Alemite lube fittings, and manual-spark magneto ignition,      your cutoff year is about '25.    </p>    <p>      To cut and bale hay quickly and efficiently or power the      silage chopper with your tractor, look for a PTO-equipped      machine, dating from the late '20s, or, preferably, a      decade later.    </p>    <p>      A post-'35 model with hydraulics and a three-point hitch      (or a slightly older model that's been retrofitted) will      let you pull a plow and haul a set of discs, use a      powerbucket or forklift to hoist construction timbers or      hay bales, move gravel and more.    </p>    <p>      Some early '50s models (the last of the two-cylinder Deeres      especially) still look like tractors should, but have high      horsepower, modern accessories, and lack the primitive      features that make the real oldies so quirky...and      appealing.    </p>    <p>      From '55 on, tractors are pretty much characterless,      interchangeable and capable of fully up-to-date, automated      farming, though at a fraction of the cost of a new tractor.      The companies abandoned the old individualistic model      designations as everything became numbers: Farmall Model      100 through 600, etc.; the higher the number, the more      powerful or specially adapted the tractor. Yawn. Do your      best to avoid the three-cylinder diesel and gas engines      that were a bad idea in the '60s.    </p>    <h3>      Where Have All The factors Gone?    </h3>    <p>      Only a handful of the hundreds of old-time tractor-makers      are in business today. Some folded, some merged with others      into major corporations, and still others were absorbed by      stronger and more competitive firms. But old tractors are      more serviceable than old cars and are slow to go to the      junkyard. Many antiques with long-forgotten names languish      in backs of barns, waiting a call to work again. So you'll      know where to look for the service manual and parts for      your old tractor, the following selected list attempts (for      the first time ever in print that we know of) to      rationalize the brand-name confusion caused by the many      interlocking ownerships, mergers, and acquisitions that      characterized a tumultuous industry over the first 50 of      the past 70 years. There is no attempt to impose order on      what was in fact a wild chaos, and arrange it in      alphabetical order. Information is current up to about      1970.    </p>    <p>      Advance-Rumley; makers of the Oil-Pull tractors and Monarch      Tractor were two of many firms merged into Allis-Chalmers      over the years. After trying an arrangement , with Fiat of      Italy, that ill-starred firm tried to quit tractor      production in 1985 and sold out to the German firm:      Klockner-Humbolt-Deutz. Contact owner-groups and collectors      for more information.    </p>    <p>      Waterloo Gasoline Engine Co (Waterloo, Iowa) was purchased      for 9.1 million dollars and change in 1918 by Deere and      Co., which used Waterloo's bullet-proof 2-cylinder engine      in the good, green John Deere farm tractors till 1960.    </p>    <p>      Hart-Parr, Nichols & Shepherd, and Cockshutt (Canada)      merged in 1929/30 with the Oliver Chilled Plow Co. to form      the Oliver Corp., which made Hart-Parr, Oliver-Hart-Parr,      and Oliver tractors. Oliver became a subsidiary of White      Motor Corp in 1960.    </p>    <p>      David Brown, a fine tractor from Great Britain, has been      imported off and on for decades. Parts and literature are      still available in the United States and Canada, or in      England at last resort.    </p>    <p>      J. I. Case Threshing Machine Co., the major employer in      Racine, Wisconsin, since 1842, manufactured threshing      machines, steam engines, a luxury automobile, and since      1913, JI Case farm tractors. In 1960 they became a      wholly-owned subsidiary of Tenneco.    </p>    <p>      Minneapolis-Moline resulted from the merger in 1929 of      three Minnesota farm equipment companies. They made the      Twin City, Minneapolis, KT, KT-A and M-M Twin City tractors      through the midthirties. The first all-purpose (row crop)      tractor designed was the Moline Universal of 1917. M-M Made      Jeeps in WW II, tractors till '69, when it merged into      White.    </p>    <p>      In the midthirties, a few Ferguson-Browns (Ford "9N"      prototypes) were made in England by Harry Ferguson in      partnership with David Brown. From '46 the Ferguson TE-20      was made in England and from '48 to '51 the Ferguson TO-20      and a few TO-30s were manufactured in Detroit by Harry, in      a challenge to former handshake-partner Henry Ford. These      were minor variations on the Ford-Ferguson "9N," but they      were good tractors. Three of them on tracks went to the      South Pole with Sir Edmund Hillory, and many chug on today.    </p>    <p>      When he won a patent-infringement award from Henry Ford,      Harry Ferguson went to Canada and merged with Massey-Harris      to form Massey-Ferguson of Toronto that bought the JI Case      Plow Works, but sold the Case name back to the Case      Threshing Machine Co. (that put it on Case tractors). They      made tractors under the names Massey-Harris, Wallis (Cub),      Ferguson, and Massey-Ferguson. In '58 they bought the UK      makers of the Perkins diesel engine.    </p>    <p>      International Harvester was created by the 1902 merger of      the giant McComick and Deering harvester companies along      with their iron, twine, sawmill, and coal interests, plus      the Illinois Northern Railway into International Harvester      Co. Their product was named the Farmall, though the      McCormick and occasionally the Deering name were attached      to one or another model. Through existing dealer networks,      they made the Titan and Mogul lines of tractors in styles      ranging from the huge locomotive-like Mogul 1020 with an      engine sporting a single cylinder that was over 8" across.    </p>    <p>      In the teens they made the Motor Cultivator, a rear-engine      design that did not sell well. To counter the Fordson, in      '24, IH brought out the Farmall, a high-bellied, row crop      tractor that reigned supreme till Ford introduced the 9N in      '39. Harvester then introduced the Raymond Lowey-designed      "A" and was back in the fray.    </p>    <p>      Nichols & Shepherd of Battle Creek, Michigan was a      major threshing machine and steam and gasoline tractor      manufacturing in the teens and '20s. Their single-cylinder      steam engines sold for $2,500 to $3,500 as late as '27.      They sold the N&S 25-50 and others under their name as      well as tractors made by John Lauson Co. In '29 they merged      with Oliver, which in turn merged into White Motor.    </p>    <p>      White Farm Equipment Co., Oak Brook, Illinois, a subsidiary      of White Motor Corp., Cleveland, Ohio was formed in '69 in      a merger between Minneapolis-Moline, Oliver, and Cockshutt.      That year, White began building the Oliver Model 1855,      which was identical to the M-M G 940. At last report they      were making the Field Boss.    </p>    	    <p>      <strong>Tractor Prices</strong>    </p>    <p>      A turn-of-the-century steam-traction engine cost more than      most farms. Prices for early gaspowered tractors were      lower, and as production increased and the technology      improved over the next forty years, they fell steadily. A      new Huber cost $1,300 in '36, an IH F-30, $1,280. In '39      Henry Ford stunned the industry by charging only $600 for      his 9N. When Harvester countered with the Farmall "A," it      was priced at $640 - half the cost of its      predecessor. The bigger Farmall "H" sold for $750 on steel      wheels and $950 on rubber. Prices were fixed during WW II,      but inflation took off shortly after V-J Day. And today, a      new farm tractor costs one hundred times those '39 prices.    </p>    <p>      The common-sense rule of thumb is that an old tractor in      good condition will cost now about what it cost new; the      bigger, the more expensive. But, I find that most tractors      dating from the 'teens through the '70s are valued more on      their condition than initial cost, size, or age, though a      rare and notable old-timer or a modern tractor in like-new      condition and "loaded" with hydraulics will sell for more      than average. These days, when most old tractors aren't      farmed, but used for show and to mow an occasional lawn,      the size/cost relationship can work in reverse. If harking      from the same model year and in equivalent shape, a      midsized Farmall "A" will go for more than a big "H," while      a little Farmall Cub can sell for more than either of them.    </p>    <p>      Prices range from around $500 for a basket case or a      clunker in "Poor" condition to $1,000 or $1,500 for a model      in "Fair" shape: rough but running. See the chart: "Used      Tractors For Sale." You'll find a '36 Huber HK listed for      $1,800; it is newly painted, in good running shape, and      will sell for $1,500 - a few hundred more than the      $1,350 it cost new during its long '27 to '44 production      run.    </p>    <p>      Above it is listed a less powerful Rumely 6. Though it cost      only $995 in its brief '31/'32 production life, the Rumely      is priced $1,100 more than the younger Huber. Only 802 of      this model were built, so the "6" is rare and popular among      old-tractor buffs.    </p>    <p>      You'll pay about $2,500 for any well-preserved full-sized      '39 or later tractor in "Good" condition (running well,      okay cosmetics). An asking price ranging from $4,500 to      $5,500 is typical for a '39 Farmall "A" (that cost $640      new) and counterparts with several attachments and      implements, if in "Very Good" condition (fine cosmetics and      running perfectly). A hydraulics/3-pt.-hitch-equipped Ford      "9N" (that cost $600 new) will cost $7,000 and up if in      show condition. Few more modern used tractors go for more.    </p>    <p>      A real antique - a late 1800s to '30s tractor in      "Excellent" show condition is a collectors' item and price      can depend as much on ribbons won as condition. The price      list contains a '28 Hart-Parr going for a high-sounding      $5,500. But when it or that '31 Rumely 6 are fully-restored      and either one wins best-of-show for several years, their      value will approach $10,000.    </p>    <p>      <strong>"NEW" OLD MODELS:</strong><br />      From '55 on, tractors were pretty much interchangeable and      capable of up-to-date farming.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Determining Your Needs</strong>    </p>    <p>      Practicality would have you measure your acreage and      determine how many plows your tractor must pull how fast      and at what fuel-consumption rate to get the crop in during      a minimum number of spring-planting days. But plowing      doesn't have a whole lot to do with choosing an old tractor      these days. All tractors will pull things (including plows,      if they must). Decide what other features (PTO, threepoint      hitch, hydraulics, front-mount accessories) you really      want. Find out if you can get them on a pre-'19 antique, a      pre-'29 realoldie, a pre-'39 oldie, or a more youthful      tractor. The older it is, the more it will be a showpiece      and hayride hauler; the younger and more capable, the more      it will be a practical workhand, easy to find replacement      parts for and repair.    </p>    <p>      Unless you are unique in the fraternity of Old-Farm-Iron      admirers, your choice will be influenced as much or more by      a tractor's character, looks, and personality. I say,      follow your instincts and get the tractor that makes you      grin like a fool, makes you warm all over, or gives you the      shivers-a tractor that just feels like the partner and boon      companion to go down the road with for a lot of years. Most      won't be able to resist the angular lines, spoke wheels,      and eccentricities of a kerosenefuel-era antique. A lot of      ex-farm boys look around for the model that Granddad had or      that they drove themselves in their youth. It's a lot like      picking a pair of jeans or a good dog.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Evaluating an Old Tractor</strong>    </p>    <p>      "Horsepower" is an artificial measurement - actually      about a dozen different measurements - rendered in      foot-pounds of torque (whatever that means) and so      confusing that old-time tractors were evaluated by the      number of plows they could pull - one-plow, two-plow,      etc. Today, auto ads bray on about little sewing-machine      engines of 100 horsepower plus, so you may not be impressed      by a farm tractor rated at only 14 hp at the drawbar, that      rating reduced by gearing from its directdrive figure of 22      hp as measured at the crankshaft: PTO/belt/brake hp.    </p>    <p>      But cars are measured running at 5,000 rpm - which      can move them well over 60 mph (and one heck of a lot      faster) in top gear. Tractors need to go a whole lot      slower, so have engines with large pistons that develop a      great deal of real power (torque) at much lower engine      speeds. They would probably rate at a hundred-hp or more if      wound up to 5,000 rpm but are governed to run at around      1,000 rpm. And they are further "geared down" to leverage      their power.    </p>    <p>      An old-timer running at top engine speed in top gear going      downhill with a tail wind has to stretch to reach 6 1/2      mph, but it can pull as many plows with it as one, two, or      four draft horses. A tractor rated as 14-22 is a large,      two-plow tractor. A 9-16 is smaller, one-plow model, but      still a genuine tractor. A 20-35 is a monster that can pull      as much as a four-horse team or better.    </p>        	    <p>      A tractor isn't a daily commuter for carrying the family      far from home at high speeds either. So, the standards of      reliability, fuel economy, and safety used in picking a car      don't apply. You want a tractor to have the power,      accessories, and implements to accomplish the tasks you      need done, to start reliably, run smoothly, and as safely      as such a hazardous device is able, but primarily to be      repairable by you or your mechanic ...and worth the money      you pay for it so you won't have lost your shirt when it      comes time to sell.    </p>    <p>      Check out the old tractors working the surrounding      countryside. If most are red, its Farmall country. If      they're mostly grass-green, it's Deere country. Gray or      dark blue means Ford, Persian orange is Allis Chalmers, and      mustard yellow, JI Case - due most likely to sales of      whichever brand was franchised to the most aggressive      dealer in the county fifty years ago.    </p>    <p>      If you can, go with the old-time sales leader. More parts      and expertise will be available locally. But you should do      well with any popular model of any familiar make. Just      beware of unfamiliar brands, especially imports and      "orphans" - machines made by a firm that's an ocean      away and/or no longer in business, so parts may be hard to      locate. Many firms merged into others and you'll be pleased      to learn that that gorgeous, Roman-nosed '57 Canadian      Cockshutt-30 you are drooling over is not a complete orphan      after all, but is a third-generation White via a merger      into Oliver. (See "Where Have All the Tractors Gone" on      page 37.)    </p>    <p>      Most tractor manufacturers bought carburetors, magnetos,      hydraulics, and other components from the same few outside      suppliers. For example, between '37 and '65, all of them      purchased diesel engines from the British company, Perkins,      and there are a lot of them around, in good shape. So, that      sturdy little '40 Leistershire Little-Ox diesel (an orphan      import) that you can get for a bargain because it needs an      engine, may not be that hard to restore after all -      with a used Perkins. But, the Ox's steering linkages,      wheels, gears, and other nonstandard parts may be nigh      impossible to get aside from a trip to a British junkyard.    </p>    <p>      Country-living novices tend to pick tractors that are too      small. Perhaps they are intimidated by, say, a huge Farmall      "Super-MD" looming over them. Demand is greatest for the      Farmall/McCormick Cub and JD Model "L" - both      considered "minis" in their time, light-weights that were      made for truck gardening. Don't get one if you will be      plowing in deep-snow country or expect to do heavy hauling.      The low, svelte (for a tractor), and sports carscale early      Ford "N"s and the cheerful, friendly, almost cute Farmall      "A" are almost as popular. They too are on a human scale      but are "real" tractors (indeed, the "N" is the greatest      two-bottom plowtractor ever designed). They are old enough      to be reasonably priced but young enough to be fitted with      an effective hitch, hydraulics, bucket loader, or most any      other modern accessory. A full catalog of replacement parts      is available for both too!    </p>    <p>      <strong>THE JOHN DEERE "G":</strong><br />      It plows hip-high snow, skids a cord of logs, and pulls      three land plows at once. Now that's a tractor.    </p>    <p>      If you have heavy hauling to do, you really should consider      such benevolent monsters as the Farmall "M" series or the      6-foot-tall John Deere Model "G" 33/27. It carries three      tons of weight (and a half-ton more if you fill the tires      with freeze-proofed water). Sturdy and reliable,      four-square, and JD Green, the "G" lacks designer styling      and burns kerosene, but it will plow hiphigh snow off the      drive in a single trip out and back, skid a cord of logs      out of the woods in one haul, pull three land plows at      once, and really get the hay in if rain's threatening. Now,      that's a tractor, mate.    </p>    <p>      But, my main piece of advice is to look for someone's "pet"      tractor. You may have to wait a while for one to come on      the market and you'll pay more but will enjoy greater      reliability and fewer repairs. Or, buy a "rebuilt" -      an oldie that's been restored by a mechanic or a farmer as      a winter project. A clunker of any common make, model, or      year bought for $500 will sell for at least $2,500 if      restored to "Very Good" working condition - which      means it has been renewed but not restored to pristine      condition. A perfectly good engine might not have been      rebuilt, and it may have a (better-working) 12-volt      electrical system in place of the original 6-volt. The same      machine in "Excellent" show condition and with every nut      and bolt all-original and all-correct and polished to a      gleam can be worth double or triple, but it can't plow any      faster. Indeed, it shouldn't be plowed, as its function is      to remain showroom-fresh for competitions.    </p>    <p>      If you have more time than money, plus the skills to      restore an old tractor yourself, get a real clunker for      peanuts and invest your own labor, not cash. Or, compromise      and buy a machine in good enough condition it will do what      you need done, and you can gussy it up at leisure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Inspection</strong>    </p>    <p>      Tractors are the least pretentious machines ever made, the      best of them exemplars of aircraft designer Bill Lear's      engineering principle: KISS: "Keep It Simple, Stupid!"      There are no government smog controls, seat belts, or      crash-resistant bumpers; no compound curves, little chrome,      and no fins, whitewalls, or stereo-hi-fi's to obscure their      utilitarian simplicity. With just enough sheet metal to      keep rain off the ignition, and the underpinnings a foot or      more off the ground, everything is accessible. Dress in old      clothes, carry an adjustable wrench and stout screwdriver,      and be ready to lift cowls, open caps, empty filter      canisters and get down on the ground and poke around in      often-greasy and dirt-coated corners and crannies.    </p>    <p>      In tractors that have been seriously farmed, dents and      dings, condition of paint, and seat padding (if any),      amount of rust, number of mouse, paper-wasp, and mud-dauber      nests under the hood will tell you if the machine has been      loved or neglected, stored outside or garaged in the barn,      actively worked or ignored in recent years.      "Beaters"-tractors worked to near death-can be      made to look pretty good with a few cans of spray paint and      $20 worth of decals. Especially beware of a tractor with      aluminum paint on the muffler; tap it hard with your      knuckle and don't be surprised if you knock a hole through      the camouflaged rust.    </p>    <p>      A tractor's age is computed in hours run, rather than miles      traveled. Engine life ranges up to 6,000 hours (since new      or latest overhaul) depending on age and size. But 2,000      hours is typical. Only more recent models-and the      fancier ones at that-have half-accurate      hour-recording instruments and you can't be sure that      they've functioned continually over 40 or 70 years. You'll      have to judge condition by checking and driving.    </p>    <p>      Tractors were powered by wood/coal steam, coal      oil/kerosene/paraffin, gasoline/petrol, naphtha, liquefied      natural gas and propane, distillate or tractor fuel, diesel      oil and combinations. Many early internal-combustion      engines used gasoline to start; then when the manifold was      hot enough to vaporize it (a brass carburetor was located      on top of the exhaust manifold), fuel was switched over to      less-expensive and more energy-concentrated oil. If you opt      for a real oldie, you may need an antique-engine expert to      teach you how to start and run it.    </p>    <h3>      Used Tractors Far Sale    </h3>    <p>      Following is a sampling of actual classified ads published      in New York/New England periodicals during the winter of      1993-94 for farm tractors of all sizes dating from the      'teens.

GC 80" wide: $800    </p>    <p>      <strong>Checking the Engine</strong>    </p>    <p>      Don't start the engine yet. First, remove dipstick or      oil-level-check plugs to inspect engine oil. It will      probably be newly changed (perhaps, for the first time in      years) so will look fresh and clear. Remove the oil filler      cap and run a finger as far down the filler pipe as you      can. If pipe or cap are crusted with thick black crud, the      engine oil hasn't been changed as often as it should. But,      some old mules are so loose and forgiving, they'll run fine      with old oil - if the filters have been changed      regularly. It may take some arm twisting and surely will      take a wrench or two, but insist on inspecting oil and air      filters. If the filter housings are rusted in place (and,      after a few decades languishing in the open or in a leaky      shed, some will be - even if the engine "runs good"      as they say in the ads), look for another tractor.    </p>    <p>      If filter housings come off but the filter elements are      caked solid or disintegrated, look elsewhere unless the      tractor has been in dead storage for decades. Shake dry      air-filter elements. If only a few dead bugs fly off the      inlet side of the first stage and very little dust comes      out the inner, that's good-even if the elements look old.      Old-style oil-bath air filters shouldn't have too much mud      built up in the base of the canister. To check, you will      have to drain most oil filters by removing the square plug      at the bottom of the canister. If oil is thick and murky      while the dipstick shows bright clean oil, the filter is      clogged so much it is being bypassed, or the owner has      changed the crankcase oil but never ran it through the      engine.    </p>    <p>      Modern paper-element oil filters will be discolored, but      don't be too concerned unless there's mud in the creases      around the outside. If you find an old-style felt oil      filter, get your hands good and greasy squeezing the      element and scraping inside the canister to see how much      mud has accumulated in the felt and how much has settled to      the bottom of the canister. Dark, even murky oil is okay,      especially in diesels, but if your hands come away thick      with grit, the filter hasn't been renewed for far too long.      I've seen tractor oil filters caked so solid that the      element had to be chiseled out. They hadn't been filtering      the oil at all for years. (If you take a tractor with an      old-style oil filter, replace with new paper-element      filters if you can.)    </p>    <p>      Don't try to get at the fuel filter - especially in a      diesel. You can introduce grit unless you take the time to      do it right. If you can't, drain it through a small      push-valve at bottom, remove the sediment bowl under the      carburetor if it comes off easily to see if it's full of      water or if crud has been allowed to build up. Don't try to      remove a badly stuck bowl unless there's a new gasket      handy.    </p>    <p>      Look in the radiator. An oil film on top of the coolant may      mean a leaking head gasket or worse, a cracked block.      Cheesy crud caked in the cap and a chalky buildup in the      tubing indicate that a lot of water has boiled away,      depositing minerals. Suspect leaks.    </p>    <p>      Check fluids in the magneto drive and hydraulic reservoirs      - including automatic transmission, brakes, and power      steering on a younger tractor. Magneto drives will contain      light oil or (in winter) kerosene, which should be clean      and clear. Hydraulic fluids should also be clear and clean;      newer dynamic hydraulic systems (that move a stream of      fluid to operate hydraulic motors) use a thin fluid. But      many older hydrostatic systems operating shortstroke      actuators only use engine oil or thick transmission fluid.      In either, murky fluids may mean neglect or considerable      wear in the pumps.    </p>    <p>      Unscrew both engine oil and transmission drain plugs just      enough to let a little lube drain out (all over your hand      and down your wrist and into your sleeve unless you are      careful). Collect drippings in a can. If they are gritty,      dirt is getting in or there is excessive wear somewhere. If      you get water, it may be nothing but condensation. Or, it      may mean a water leak in the engine, or a left-off filler      cap letting rain in. If you find water in the transmission,      suspect a split shift-lever boot.    </p>    <p>      Look on the ground for puddles of oil or hydraulic fluid      and other obvious problems, like flat or deeply gashed      tires. Then, if it holds up so far, go for a ride.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Tractor-Drawn Implements</strong>    </p>    <p>      Like a horse or mule, to accomplish much, a tractor needs      to be harnessed to working implements. Chances are that the      original hay baler, manure spreader, discs, and plow made      to fit that '29 JI Case "L" (with PTO) you are admiring are      rusting silently in a longforgotten tree line bordering an      abandoned field miles away. Finding antique land plows in      working condition is harder than finding old tractors. Most      Deere Walking beam plows still alive anchor a circle of      geraniums decorating country front yards.    </p>    <p>      Advertise for implements and you may be luckier than I was      trying to locate cultivators for my Farmall "A." Implements      are advertised in the same classifieds where you looked for      your tractor. Universal PTO-powered implements will fit      most tractors. Wheel-driven implements from the horse &      wagon days can be pulled by any tractor. I have been known      to risk a floating kidney or truncated extremities sitting      on the God-awful-hard cast-iron seat of a clanking old      mowing machine. The sickle-bar cutter was powered by a      "bull wheel" - a big ground-driven cleated wheel that      transferred its rotary motion to the back-and-forth cutter      bar with a hideously dangerous exposed-gear transmission      that required constant oiling. It was one miserable ride. I      was constantly splattered with oil, and chaff stuck to the      oil - but it was still better than mowing by hand      with a scythe. I've also taken my shift on a rear-dump,      riding hay rake - also a rough ride, but less      perilous and a lot easier than hand-windrowing.    </p>    <p>      I've never ever seen an old woodbed manure spreader that      wasn't rusted and rotted to compost. But you can find used      and still-working steel-bed spreaders in some farm yards,      and new small-farm spreaders in homesteading equipment      catalogs. A rotovator or independently powered garden      tiller made for lawn tractors can replace plow, disc, and      harrow on small spreads if repeated passes don't take too      much time for you. Or, you can have your land plowed by a      neighbor with a more modern rig. Then so long as you don't      let weeds reestablish, you can pull discs and bedspring      harrows to stir and smooth the soil before planting year      after year. However, if you plan to let fields lie fallow      every third year as you should to maintain fertility, don't      let weeds mature or you'll have to plow sod again. Crop      with annual wheat or rye in spring and fall, let weeds      germinate and grow briefly in between and disc the "green      manure" in before any plants get a sod-deep foothold.    </p>    <p>      If you fancy natural, organic gardening methods, think      twice before planning to farm with an old tractor by      adopting the "no-till" methods being touted by the U.S.D.A.      and promoted by the agricultural chemical companies. It      sounds good at first; you don't deepplow and risk soil      erosion, but lightly disc in plant residue - which      adds plant matter to the soil - then plant into the      rubble. But, controlling weeds and insects is all done with      a variety of chemicals. Better to disc weedy residues      lightly in fall, then plan on tilling or harrowing soil      several times before planting in spring. Each time you      disc, you kill a new crop of newly germinated weeds and      bring a new batch of seeds and pests to the surface to be      eaten by birds or killed by exposure.    </p>    <p>      <strong>The Road Test</strong>    </p>    <p>      Have the owner show you how to start the tractor. If it's      been sitting for a while, the start-up may take a while;      you may even have to remove and clean spark plugs. When it      does turn over, a shower of rust may erupt from the muffler      and the fumes may be a little smoky at first. But, once      warmed up, there should be no smoke. Gas-engine exhaust      should have the sweet, nostalgic smell of a      non-emissions-controlled gas engine. (And, with some      experience, you'll be able to tell if the mixture has      gotten too rich or lean by smell and engine sound -      then be able to adjust it yourself by turning a single      screw for mixture and another for idle speed.)    </p>    <p>      Diesel exhaust stinks, but should be clean. With either      fuel, a little smoke on acceleration or a gear change      probably means a tune-up is needed. A lot of smoke means      rings are worn. A steady, thin blue smoke indicates enough      wear that a rebuild will be needed soon - at about      $1,500. Listen to the engine. Diesels are noisy, especially      on start-up, but quiet down to a regular valve-rattle. A      slap-slap sound or irregular clunk in any engine is cause      for deep suspicion.    </p>    <p>      Now, go. Shifting will take practice and the gearbox may be      stiff till transmission grease warms up. But it should go      into all gears without too much wrestling. The clutch      should operate without shuddering, and if not worn, will      engage before the pedal or hand-clutch gets too far out (in      an old tractor, you may have to fish around for the correct      gear and double-clutch to avoid grinding). Try the      hydraulics and other accessories. Try the lights, brakes,      and other luxuries, if any. Don't expect to find a horn,      heater, or air conditioning in an old tractor, though some      top-of-the-line, late '40s and newer models with full cabs      have them - radios too.    </p>    <p>      Tractor steering is far from precise at its best. If the      wheel has more than a quarter-turn of play, if turning is      very hard, or if steering seems to catch, then free up      suddenly, suspect worn steering-gearboxes or worn linkages,      tie-rod ends, or steering knuckles. If the tractor drives      as though it is limping, if front wheels wobble visibly or      slop from side to side, suspect worn kingpins, bad hubs,      bearings, or spindles. If rear wheels wobble, it could be a      bad hub, internal gear, bearing, or bent stub axle inside      the iron axle housing. More likely, it is a bent or rusted      wheel rim or a tire that hasn't moved for so long it has a      flat spot that will run out in time. If brakes don't seem      to work, stand on the pedal (or pedals, one for each side).      If they pull to one side, brakes need adjusting (or if      hydraulic, need bleeding). If they squeal or grind, the      band or pads are probably worn to bare metal, which can      make a fingernails-on-blackboard sound that sets your teeth      on edge but is not critical. Tractors have a predictably      hard time going fast enough to need brakes very often.      Really old models don't even have brakes; all will brake      automatically when you decelerate in gear, and some old      worm-gear drives come to a halt when you take them out of      gear.    </p>    <p>      Don't spend too much time groping around for the parking      brake. On most old tractors it is reverse gear and a couple      of wood blocks.    </p>    <p>      Turn hard both ways. Speed up and slow down. Go out on the      road, put her into high and "speed." The transmission will      yowl and whine. But any bad bearings will reveal themselves      with a grinding sound. Try all the controls and switches,      especially hydraulics. If you don't see the hydraulics      work, don't pay extra for them. Hydraulic pumps and pistons      are easily ruined through simple neglect and are expensive      to replace or repair.    </p>    <p>      After the ride, check all around again and note any leaks      in water hoses or around fuel tank, water or fuel pump, and      any fresh oil seeps. If you are reasonably sure the tractor      has small problems you can't repair yourself, or if you      even remotely suspect major problems, find a qualified      tractor mechanic and pay him $50 to come out and check it      over. Indeed, if you are a novice and the money is more      than you can spare, have the tractor checked no matter how      good it looks, sounds, and drives.    </p>    <p>      Not being roadable, tractors aren't licensed or titled.      Insist on seeing the owner's bill of sale. Be sure chassis      and engine serial numbers jibe with numbers on the      document. Do your dickering, make up a valid bill of sale      (you can find 50statelegal forms at a stationers), give      over your cash, load your tractor on a car hauler, and take      her home. On the way, get as much service and maintenance      done as you can. Whatever you do, don't have an old tractor      steam-cleaned or you can strip paint, melt rubber, and ruin      electrical parts. But, a warm-water      pressure-cleaning/degreasing of the outside and a complete      fluids change at a tractor shop or big-truck dealer will      save you more than a little time and plenty of disposal      problems. Indeed, if mechanical or body work is in order,      you may as well drop the tractor at the shop, discuss the      details, and then drive right home and start making tractor      space in the barn - if you are lucky enough to have      one.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Endnote</strong>    </p>    <p>      Finally, tractors aren't cheap to buy or keep running.      Lacking that barn, you'll need to buy a long shed to keep      tractor and implements out of the weather. Equipment sheds      aren't cheap either. Plus: You'll need permits from the      fire department to install a farm-fuel tank and from the      environment protection officials to store and dispose of      lubricants.    </p>    <p>      Repairing a flat tire requires a big jack, huge tire irons,      and a strong back. Imagine having to remove a stone-flat      1/4-ton mud-caked cleated wheel in the middle of a field      full of 8-foot-tall corn. In a driving rain. A half mile      from any road.    </p>    <p>      And barn calls by a mechanic or field tiretruck cost      $50/hour - including travel time.    </p>    <p>      Do you really need a tractor that bad?    </p>    <p>      Sure you do!    </p>    <p>      Well, so do I...and if you're free for another half-hour      (and promise not to grab it before I can get the cash      together) I'll show you this ...gorgeous little Farmall      "A," its paint shiny bright red, original decals intact,      the huge lugged tires barely worn and ...oops, I already      said that didn't I?    </p>    <p>      Well, I've been waiting along time for another one. It only      costs $2,500 (a figure with a familiar ring, come to think      of it), but I still have that Dekalb hybrid corn sign      somewhere ...    </p>    <p>      <strong>Earth-moving</strong>    </p>    <p>      Some used farm tractors will come with accessory      telescoping booms or front-end bucket loaders or plows      operated by a pneumatic cylinder, hand cranks, or      hydraulics. But farm buckets are wide for scooping      lightweight feed grain, bedding, or manure, and booms are      long for lifting hay bales or feed sacks into the loft.      They aren't designed for moving earth in quantity. Plus,      removing and reattaching this weighty gear requires stout      lifting equipment - big jacks or a barn with heavy      overhead beams and a pair of heavy-duty ratchet-equipped      block-&-tackles... or another tractor.    </p>    <p>      Better, if you plan to do more earth-moving or construction      than farming, would be an industrial tractor that is      designed more for lifting and pushing than pulling and      hauling. Most carry a compact bucket loader stout enough to      excavate a cellar hole, and a rear-mounted backhoe that      will dig a 9'-deep trench for a water pipe or septic-tank      leach line. They have hydraulic support-feet that swing out      at the sides and set them in place, level and firmly, so      they don't roll when you dig and don't tip when the bucket      is full.    </p>    <p>      Construction tractors date from the '50s to the present, so      are decades younger than many commonly available farm      tractors. In good shape, and with half its 2,000 hours of      operating life left before an engine, transmission, and      hydraulic rebuild become necessities, a loader/backhoe will      cost the better part of $10,000 (and often more) no matter      the age. Even a clunker in fair to poor condition goes for      $2,500 minimum.    </p>    <p>      <strong>SOURCES</strong>    </p>    <p>      You must have the service manual for your tractor.
