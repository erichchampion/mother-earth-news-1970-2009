            			<p>				<strong>LAST LAUGH</strong>     </p>    	<h5 id="byline">		      By Jeff Taylor    </h5>    <p>      <em><strong>Did city life and country diet kill Elvis? The      rural/urban debate continues.</strong></em>    </p>    <p>      No one can deny that city living is bad for the body and      hard on the mind, or that life in the country is hard on      the body but good for the soul. In a city you can live      well, even luxuriously; if your soul gets in the way, lose      its number. But in the country, I submit you have a better      shot at a long and healthy life. To prove this hypothesis,      let us briefly compare the two life-styles and      specifically, the disparities in diet, exercise, stress      levels, and toxin cleansing.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Diet:</strong> A typical city breakfast is one      piece of dry toast, half a grapefruit, juice, a bowl of      cornflakes with skim milk, and one cup of decaffeinated      coffee. Aside from quiche, eggs don't appear on the menu      very often; city people who care about their health avoid      eggs because of their cholesterol. So the typical country      breakfast - two fresh, brown eggs easy-over with a      slab of country ham and a side of waffles drenched in syrup      and butter - would seem to be the serving of a death      warrant for the city dweller; three cups of strong coffee      with real cream would just about sign it. It was combining      a country diet with a city lifestyle that killed Elvis.    </p>    <p>      Out here, we seldom breakfast on cereal in a bay window      like those (city-based) actors in bathrobes who have      misplaced their spoons, because most sane country people      would prefer real food to a bowl of sweetened kibble.      Granola is a city food. Carbo loading was invented in the      country, where calories burn off fast, which leads me to...    </p>        <p>      <strong>Exercise:</strong> In the city, you sit perfectly still in a chair      during breakfast, scanning a newspaper to stay abreast of      the murder, mayhem, scandals, scams, swindles, and stock      market collapses, all the jangling data to prime you for      another day in the concrete jungle. Then you sit perfectly      still in a car or train seat until you arrive at the      office, where you sit perfectly still in a chair and maybe      take an electronic bath in video-terminal rays for eight      hours. At the end of the day, you go to a health club and      make a little sweat.    </p>    <p>      But experts agree that running, deep breathing, and/or hard      physical labor is the best way to work off stress and stay      fit. No problem. Getting out of bed, you observe that the      chickens are in the garden or the horse has picked the gate      latch and is bolting for the hills. Fifteen minutes of      chasing chickens is equivalent to an hour of jogging, but      catching a horse makes the Boston Marathon seem like a      stroll.    </p>    <p>      By this time your blood is circulating pretty well, and      it's time to get to work. A spade is the ultimate implement      for exercise in the country. Few health clubs have shovels      in the weight room, but this tool is unsurpassed for      working the entire upper body, biceps, triceps, neck,      shoulders, quads, pecs, and abs, not to mention the thighs,      calves, ankles, and toes. A day spent digging in the garden      and pushing a wheelbarrow full of dirt or manure simply      cannot be compared to a day spent sitting in a chair,      screaming on the phone and chewing antacid tablets.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stress Level:</strong> No contest. See above.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Toxin Cleansing:</strong> If we pretend that air      you can see is just as good as the air you can breathe, the      city mouse appears to have the advantage. But, frankly, I      think the major environmental toxin that affects both      groups is tobacco addiction. Drive along any city street at      noon, and you will see the buildings empty as smokers rush      down (riding an elevator, perfectly still) from the      conditioned air into the smog and bus fumes, to poison      themselves even further.    </p>    <p>      Out in the country, you can use any form of tobacco      anywhere you like, sucking smoke or spitting juice all day      long. The entire workplace is outdoors after all; have a      cigar and only your lungs will complain. But the major      drawback, accessibility to supply, is also the biggest      asset to your health program. When you live 10 miles from      the nearest cigarette outlet, you eventually stop smoking      because one time the car won't start, another time you run      out of gas, and another time a cop pulls you over. The      cumulative daily hassle of scoring tobacco makes you quit.    </p>    <p>      In the city, you slap an expensive patch on your neck, type      furiously, and suffer in silence. Out here, you can just      grit your teeth and pick up a hoe, beating the dirt and      shrieking at the top of your lungs for three days, while      your family hurriedly takes off to visit sick relatives in      the city.    </p>
