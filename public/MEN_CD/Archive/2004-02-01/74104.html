Brown    </h5>		<p>Illustrations by Tom Griffin	</p>	        <p>      <em>In our last issue, in his article, "Growing...      Growing... Gone?", global environmental sustainability      expert Lester R. Brown outlined the huge environmental      challenges our civilization faces. Now be presents the good      news, spelling out how citizens around the world can      quickly mobilize to move us beyond "business as usual" and      implement what he calls "Plan B. " Brown explains the      shifts in government spending, tax policies and subsidies      that we can, and must, make in order to create an      environmentally sustainable eco-economy that serves the      basic needs of all citizens and respects the Earth's      limited natural resources.</em>    </p>    <p>      - MOTHER    </p>    <p>      Plan B is my proposal for a massive mobilization to deflate      our environmental "bubble" economy-one in which      economic output is artificially inflated by overconsumption      of the Earth's natural resources-before it reaches      the bursting point. Keeping the global economic bubble from      bursting will require an unprecedented degree of      international cooperation to stabilize population, climate,      water tables and soils-and at wartime speed. In both      scale and urgency, the effort required is comparable to      U.S. mobilization during World War II.    </p>    <p>      Our hope now is rapid systemic change based on market      signals that tell the ecological truth. This means      restructuring the tax system by lowering income taxes and      raising taxes on environmentally destructive activities,      such as burning fossil fuels, to incorporate the ecological      costs. Unless we can create a market that reflects reality,      we will continue making faulty decisions as consumers,      corporate planners and government policymakers.      Ill-informed economic decisions and the economic      distortions they create will lead to economic decline.    </p>    <p>      Plan B is the only viable option simply because Plan A,      which is continuing with business as usual, offers an      unacceptable outcome-continued environmental      degradation and a bursting of the economic bubble. The      warning signals are coming more frequently: collapsing      fisheries, melting glaciers and falling water tables. So      far the wakeup calls have been local, but soon, they could      become global. For instance, massive imports of grain by      China and the rise in food prices that likely would follow      could awaken us from our lethargy. But time is running out.      Bubble economies, which by definition are artificially      inflated, cannot continue indefinitely. Our demands on the      Earth exceed its regenerative capacity by a wider margin      with each passing day.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stabilizing world population</strong> at about 7.5      billion is central to avoiding economic breakdown in      countries with large projected population increases that      already are overconsuming their natural capital assets.      Some 36 countries in Europe and Japan have essentially      stabilized their populations, but the challenge now is to      create the economic and social conditions that will lead to      population stability in all countries. The keys here are      extending primary education to all children, providing      vaccinations and basic health care, and offering      reproductive health care and family planning services in      all countries.    </p>    <p>      <strong>Stabilizing falling water tables</strong> is even      more difficult than stabilizing population because the      forces triggering the fall have their own momentum that      must be reversed. Stopping the fall depends on quickly      raising water productivity-the urgency of this effort      is difficult to overstate. Failure to stop the fall in      water tables by systematically reducing water use will lead      to the depletion of aquifers, an abrupt cutback in water      supplies and the risk of a precipitous drop in food      production. Many countries are now using highly efficient      drip-irrigation technology, which is ideally suited to      areas where water is scarce and labor is abundant, to      produce high-value crops.    </p>    <p>      With <strong>soil erosion</strong> , we have no choice but      to reduce soil loss to at least match the rate of soil      formation. Otherwise we face a continued decline in the      inherent fertility of eroding soils and cropland      abandonment.    </p>    <p>      South Korea and the United States stand out for their      efforts in stabilizing soils. South Korea, with      once-denuded mountainsides now covered with trees, has      achieved a level of flood control, water storage and      hydrological stability that is a model for other countries.      Only a narrow demilitarized zone separates the two Koreas,      but the contrast between them is stark. In North Korea,      little permanent vegetation remains, droughts and floods      alternate, and hunger is chronic. The U.S. record in soil      conservation also is impressive. Beginning in the late      1980s, gov ernment policies guided U.S. farmers to retire      roughly 10 percent of the most erodible cropland and plant      grasses on the bulk of it. In addition, the United States      leads the world in adopting minimum-till, notill and other      soil-conserving practices. With this combination of      programs and practices, the United States has reduced soil      erosion by nearly 40 percent in less than two decades.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A NEW KIND OF PATRIOTISM</strong>    </p>    <p>      Adopting Plan B is unlikely unless the united States      assumes a leadership position, much as it did in World War      II. After an all-out mobilization, the U.S. engagement      helped turn the tide, leading the Allied Forces to victory      within three-and-a-half years. Achieving this goal was      possible only by converting existing industries to the war      effort and using materials that previously went toward      manufacturing civilian goods. The year 1942 witnessed the      greatest expansion of industrial output in the nation's      history-all for military use. Early in the year, the      U.S. government banned the production and sale of cars and      trucks for private use, halted residential and highway      construction, and banned driving for pleasure. It also      introduced a rationing program involving products such as      tires, gasoline, fuel oil and sugar. Cutting back on      consumption of these goods liberated resources to support      the war effort.    </p>    <p>      In retrospect, <strong>the speed of the conversion from a      peacetime to a wartime economy was stunning</strong> .      Harnessing U.S. industrial power tipped the scales      decisively toward the Allied Forces, reversing the tide of      war: Germany and Japan could not match the United States'      effort.    </p>    <p>      This mobilization of resources within a matter of months      demonstrates that a country, and indeed the world, can      restructure its economy quickly if convinced of the need to      do so. The issue is not whether most people will eventually      be won over, but whether they will be convinced before the      bubble economy collapses.    </p>        <p>      <strong>CREATING AN HONEST MARKET</strong>    </p>    <p>      The key to restructuring the economy is the creation of an      honest market, one that tells the ecological truth. The      market is an incredible institution, but it does have three      weaknesses: It does not incorporate the indirect costs of      goods and services, it does not value nature's services      properly, and it does not respect the sustainable-yield      thresholds of natural systems such as fisheries, forests,      rangelands and aquifers.    </p>    <p>      Throughout most of recorded history, the indirect costs of      economic activity-the sustainable yields of natural      systems or the value of nature's services-were of      little concern because the scale of human activity was so      small relative to the size of the Earth. But with the      sevenfold expansion in the world economy over the last      half-century, failing to address these market shortcomings      and the economic distortions they create will lead to      economic decline.    </p>    <p>      As the global economy expanded and technology evolved, the      indirect costs of some products have become far more than      the market price. The price of gasoline, for instance,      includes only production costs.    </p>    <p>      Calculating the true costs to society of our reliance on      gasoline means including the medical costs of treating      those who are ill from breathing polluted air; the costs of      acid-rain damage to lakes, forests, crops and buildings;      and, by far the largest, the costs of climate change.      Higher temperatures can wither crops and reduce harvests.      They can melt ice and raise sea levels, inundating coastal      cities, low-lying agricultural lands and low-elevation      island countries. The interesting question is: What is the      cost of burning a gallon of gasoline to society?    </p>    <p>      No one has attempted to fully assess the worldwide costs of      rising temperatures and allocate those costs by gallon of      gasoline or ton of coal. Some studies on the external cost      of automobile use in the United States, however, were done      during the early-and mid-1990s, including direct      subsidies such as parking subsidies and many local      environmental costs. A summary of eight of these studies by      John Holtzclaw of the Sierra Club indicates that if the      price were raised enough to make drivers pay some of the      indirect costs of automobile use, a gallon of gas would      cost anywhere from $3.03 to $8.64. No studies,      unfortunately, incorporated <em>all</em> the costs of using      gasoline-including the future inundation of coastal      cities, island countries and rice-growing river flood      plains.    </p>    <p>      A world facing the prospect of economically disruptive      climate change can no longer justify subsidies to expand      burning coal and oil.    </p>    <p>      Something is wrong. If we have learned anything over the      last few years, it is that <strong>dishonest accounting      systems can be costly</strong> . Faulty corporate      accounting systems that overstate income or leave costs off      the books have driven some of the world's largest      corporations into bankruptcy, costing millions of people      their lifetime savings, retirement incomes and jobs.    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, we also have a faulty economic accounting      system at the global level, but with potentially far more      serious consequences. Economic prosperity is achieved in      part by running up ecological deficits costs that do not      show up 'on the books but that someone will pay eventually.      Some of the record economic prosperity of recent decades      has come from too-rapid consumption of the Earth's      productive assets-its forests, rangelands, fisheries,      soils and aquifers-and from destabilizing its      climate.    </p>    <p>      Some of the looming costs associated with continued      fossil-fuel burning are virtually incalculable; the      outcome, unacceptable. What is the cost of inundating half      of Bangladesh's rice land by a 1-meter rise in sea level?      How much is this land worth in a country the size of New      York state with a population half that of the United      States? And what would be the cost of relocating the 40      million Bangladeshis who would be displaced by the 1-meter      rise in sea level? Could they be moved to another part of      the country? Or would they migrate to less densely      populated countries, such as the United States, Canada,      Australia and Brazil?    </p>    <p>      Another challenge in creating an honest market is getting      it to value nature's services. For example, after several      weeks of flooding in the Yangtze River basin in      1998-flooding that eventually inflicted $30 billion      worth of damage and destruction-the Chinese      government announced it was banning all tree cutting in the      basin. It justified the ban by saying that standing trees      are worth three times as much as cut trees. This      calculation recognized that the flood control service      provided by forests was far more valuable than the timber.    </p>    <p>      Forests also recycle rainfall inland. About 20 years ago,      two Brazilian scientists, Eneas Salati and Peter Vose,      published an article in <em>Science</em> stating that when      rainfall from clouds moving in from the Atlantic fell on      the healthy Amazon rain forest, one-fourth of the water ran      off and threefourths evaporated into the atmosphere, to be      carried further inland to provide more rainfall. But when      land was cleared for grazing, the numbers were      reversed-with roughly three-fourths running off and      one-fourth evaporating for recycling inland. Ecologist      Philip Fearnside, who has made a career of studying the      Amazon, observes that the agriculturally prominent      south-central part of Brazil depends on water that is      recycled inland via the Amazon rain forest. If ranchers      convert the Amazon into pasture, he notes, there will be      less rainfall to support agriculture.    </p>    <p>      Once we calculate all the costs of a product or service, we      can incorporate them into market prices by restructuring      taxes. If we create a market that tells the truth, we can      avoid being blindsided by faulty accounting systems that      lead to bankruptcy.    </p>    <p>      <strong>RESTRUCTURING TAXES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Economists have widely endorsed the need for tax      shifting-lowering income taxes while raising taxes on      environmentally destructive activities-in order to      create an honest market. These taxes reflect the indirect      costs of an economic activity to society. For example, a      tax on coal would incorporate the increased health care      costs associated with breathing polluted air, the costs of      damage from acid rain and the costs of climate disruption.      Nine countries in western Europe have begun tax shifting,      known as environmental tax reform. The amount of revenue      shifted so far is small, just a few percent, but enough      experience has been gained to know it works.    </p>    <p>      Among the activities taxed in Europe are carbon emissions,      heavy metals emissions and the generation of garbage. Tax      shifting does not change the level of taxes, only their      composition. One of the better-known changes was a      four-year plan adopted in 1999 in Germany to shift taxes      from labor to energy. By 2001, this initiative had lowered      fuel use by 5 percent. A tax on carbon emissions adopted in      1990 in Finland lowered emissions 7 percent by 1998 in that      country.    </p>    <p>      Environmental tax reform is spreading outside Europe as      well. The United States, for example, imposed a stiff tax      on chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) to phase them out in      accordance with the Montreal Protocol of 1987. At the local      level, the city of Victoria, British Columbia, adopted a      trash tax of $1.20 per bag of garbage, reducing its daily      trash flow by 18 percent within one year.    </p>    <p>      One of the newer taxes gaining popularity is called a      congestion tax. Two decades ago, Singapore was the first      city to adopt such a tax. Although it was quite successful,      only recently have other cities, such as Oslo, Norway, and      Melbourne, Australia, done so. City governments tax      vehicles entering the city, or at least the inner part of      the city, where traffic congestion is most serious. In      early 2003, London became the largest city to adopt a      congestion tax; the average speed of an automobile was 9      mph-about the same as a horse-drawn carriage. An $8      charge on all motorists driving into the city center      between 7 a.m. and 6:30 p.m. immediately reduced the number      of vehicles by 24 percent, permitting traffic to flow more      freely while cutting pollution and noise.    </p>    <p>      For some products where the external costs are large and      obvious, pressure is mounting to impose taxes. By far the      most dramatic example is the agreement negotiated between      the tobacco industry and state governments in the United      States. After numerous state governments launched      litigation to force tobacco companies to reimburse them for      the Medicare costs associated with treating smoking-related      illnesses, the industry decided to negotiate a package      reimbursement, agreeing in November 1998 to reimburse the      50 state governments $251 billion-nearly $1,000 for      every person in the United States. This landmark agreement      was, in effect, a retroactive tax on cigarettes smoked in      the past, one designed to incorporate some of the indirect      costs.    </p>    <p>      Environmental tax shifting also usually brings a double      dividend. In reducing taxes on income-in effect,      taxes on labor-labor becomes less costly, creating      additional jobs while protecting the environment. This was      the principal motivation in the German four-year shift from      income to energy taxes. T he shift from fossil fuels to      more energy-efficient technologies and to renewable energy      sources reduces carbon emissions and represents a      transition to more labor-intensive industries. Similarly,      by lowering the air pollution from smokestacks and      tailpipes, carbon taxes also reduce respiratory illnesses      such as asthma and emphysema, and health care costs-a      triple dividend.    </p>    <p>      When it comes to reflecting the value of nature, ecologists      can calculate the values of services a forest provides in a      given location. Once these are determined, they can be      incorporated into the price of trees as a "stumpage tax"      similar to the sort Bulgaria and Lithuania have adopted.      Anyone wishing to cut a tree in these countries has to pay      a tax equal to the value of the services that tree      provides. Because forest services may be worth several      times as much as the timber, this tax reduces tree cutting      and encourages wood and paper recycling. These sorts of      taxes create a more truthful market.    </p>    <p>      Tax shifting also helps countries gain the lead in      producing new energy-efficient technologies. For example,      the Danish government's tax incentives for wind-generated      electricity have made Denmark, a country of only 5 million      people, the world's leading manufacturer of wind turbines.      Environmental tax shifting reduces taxes on wages and      encourages investment in activities like wind power and      recycling, thus simultaneously boosting employment and      lessening environmental destruction.    </p>        <p>      <strong>SHIFTING SUBSIDIES</strong>    </p>    <p>      Each year the world's taxpayers underwrite $700 billion in      subsidies for environmentally destructive activities, such      as burning fossil fuels, overpumping aquifers,      clear-cutting forests and overfishing. A 1997 book-length      Earth Council study entitled <em>Subsidizing Unsustainable      Development</em> observes, "There is something unbelievable      about the world spending hundreds of billions of dollars      annually to subsidize its own destruction."    </p>    <p>      Iran provides a classic example of extreme subsidies: The      country prices oil for internal use at one-tenth the world      price, strongly encouraging the consumption of gasoline.      The World Bank reports that if this $3.6 billion annual      subsidy were phased out, it would reduce Iran's carbon      emissions by a staggering 49 percent. It also would      strengthen the economy by freeing up pub lic revenues for      investment in the country's economic and social      development. But Iran is not alone. The Bank reports that      removing energy subsidies would reduce carbon emissions in      Venezuela by 26 percent, in Russia by 17 percent, in India      by 14 percent and in Indonesia by 11 percent.    </p>    <p>      Some countries already are eliminating or reducing these      climate-disrupting subsidies. Belgium, France and Japan      have phased out all subsidies for coal. Germany reduced its      coal subsidies from $5.4 billion in 1989 to $2.8 billion in      2002, meanwhile lowering its coal use by 46 percent.      Germans plan to phase these subsidies out entirely by 2010.      China cut its coal subsidy from $750 million in 1993 to      $240 million in 1995. More recently, it has imposed a tax      on high-sulfur coals. Together, these two measures helped      to reduce coal use in China by 5 percent between 1997 and      2001, when the economy was expanding by one-third.    </p>    <p>      Just as a need for tax shifting exists, we also dearly need      to shift subsidies. A world facing the prospect of      economically disruptive climate change, for example, can no      longer justify subsidies to expand burning coal and oil.      Shifting these subsidies to the development of      climate-benign energy sources such as wind power, solar      power and geothermal power is the key to stabilizing the      Earth's climate. Shifting subsidies from road construction      to rail construction can increase mobility in many areas      while reducing carbon emissions. Eliminating      environmentally destructive subsidies reduces the burden on      taxpayers while discouraging the destructive activities      themselves.    </p>    <p>      In a troubled world economy facing fiscal deficits at all      levels of government, exploiting these tax and subsidy      shifts with their double and triple dividends can help      balance the books and save the environment. Tax and subsidy      shifting promise gains in economic efficiency and      reductions in environmental destruction, a win-win      situation.    </p>    <p>      Unless we respond to the social and environmental issues      undermining our future, we may not be able to avoid      economic decline and social integration.    </p>    <p>      <strong>A CALL TO GREATNESS</strong>    </p>    <p>      History judges political leaders by whether they respond to      the great issues of their time. For today's leaders, that      issue is how to deflate the world's bubble economy before      it bursts. This bubble threatens the future of everyone,      rich and poor alike. It challenges us to restructure the      global economy, to build an eco-economy.    </p>    <p>      A sense is growing among the more thoughtful political and      opinion leaders worldwide that business as usual is no      longer a viable option, that unless we respond to the      social and environmental issues undermining our future, we      may not be able to avoid economic decline and social      disintegration. The prospect of failing states is growing      as mega-threats such as the HIV epidemic, water shortages      and land hunger threaten to overwhelm countries on the low      er rungs of the global economic ladder. Failed states are a      matter of concern not only because of the social costs to      their people, but also because they serve as ideal bases      for international terrorist organizations.    </p>    <p>      Thus, we now have some idea of what needs to be done and      how to do it. The United Nations has set social goals for      education, health and the reduction of hunger and poverty.      In my book <em>Plan B: Rescuing a Planet Under Stress and a      Civilization in Trouble</em> (available on MOTHER'S      Bookshelf, Page 127), I have sketched out a restructuring      of the energy economy to stabilize atmospheric carbon      dioxide levels, a plan to stabilize population, a strategy      for raising land productivity and restoring the Earth's      vegetation, and a plan to raise water productivity      worldwide. The goals are essential, and the technologies      are available.    </p>    <p>      <strong>We have</strong> <strong>the wealth to achieve      these goals.</strong> What we do not yet have is the      leadership. And if the past is any guide to the future,      that leadership can only come from the United States. By      far the wealthiest society that has ever existed, the      United States has the resources to lead this effort.      Economist Jeffrey Sachs sums it up well: "The tragic irony      of this moment is that the rich countries are so rich and      the poor so poor that a few added tenths of 1 percent of      GNP from the rich ones camped up over the coming decades      could do what was never before possible in human      history-ensure that the basic needs of health and      education are met for all impoverished children in this      world." How many more tragedies will we suffer in this      country before we wake up to our capacity to help make the      world a safer and more prosperous place not through      military might, but through the gift of life itself?    </p>    <p>      Unfortunately, the United States continues to focus on      building a stronger military, as though that were the key      to addressing these threats. The $343-billion U.S. defense      budget for 2002 (which does not include the most recent      appropriation of $87 billion for Iraq) dwarfs those of      other countries-allies and others alike (see chap on      Page 96). U.S. allies, most of them NATO members, spend      $205 billion a year on the military; Russia spends $60      billion; China, $42 billion; and Iran, Iraq, and North      Korea combined spend $12 billion. <strong>The United States      is spending more militarily than all its allies and      possible adversaries combined</strong> . As retired admiral      Eugene Carroll, Jr., observed, "For 45 years of the Cold      War, we were in an arms race with the Soviet Union. Now it      appears we are in an arms race with ourselves."    </p>    <p>      The World Bank conservatively estimates the additional      external funding needed to achieve universal primary      education in the 88 developing countries that require help      at $15 billion per year. Funding for an adult literacy      program based largely on volunteers is estimated at $4      billion. The World Health Organization estimates that      providing for basic health care would cost $21 billion. The      additional funding needed to provide reproductive health      and family planning services to all women in developing      countries is $10 billion a year.    </p>    <p>      Closing the condom gap and providing the additional condoms      needed to control the spread of HIV in the developing world      and Eastern Europe requires $2.2 billion-$270 million      for condoms and $1.9 billion for AIDS prevention education      and condom distribution. The cost per year of extending      school lunch programs to the 44 poorest countries is $6      billion per year. An additional $4 billion per year would      cover the cost of assistance to preschool children and      pregnant women in these countries.    </p>    <p>      In total, this comes to $62 billion, <strong>less than one      tenth of what the world currently spends on military      programs!</strong> If the United States offered to cover      one-third of this additional funding, the other industrial      countries would almost certainly be willing to provide the      remainder, and the worldwide effort to eradicate hunger,      illiteracy, disease and poverty would begin.    </p>    <p>      It is easy to spend billions in response to terrorist      threats, but the reality is that the resources needed to      disrupt a modern economy are small, and a Department of      Homeland Security, however heavily funded, provides only      minimal protection from terrorists. The challenge is not      only to provide a high-tech military response to terrorism,      but to build a global society that is environmentally      sustainable, socially equitable and democratically based.      Such an effort would more effectively undermine the spread      of terrorism than a doubling of military expenditures.    </p>    <p>      The challenge is not just to alleviate poverty, but also to      build an economy that is compatible with the Earth's      natural systems-an eco-economy, an economy that can      sustain progress. This means a fundamental restructuring of      the energy economy and a substantial modification of the      food economy. It also requires raising energy productivity      and shifting from fossil fuels to renewables. Lastly, it      entails raising water productivity over the next      half-century, much as we increased land productivity over      the last one.    </p>    <p>      We can build an economy that does not destroy its natural      support systems, a global community where the basic needs      of all the Earth's people are satisfied, and a world that      will allow us to think of ourselves as civilized. This is      entirely doable. To paraphrase Franklin Roosevelt at      another hinge point in history: Let no one say it cannot be      done.    </p>    <p>      The choice is ours-yours and mine. We can continue      business as usual and preside over a global bubble economy      that will expand until it bursts and leads to economic      decline. Or, we can adopt Plan B and become the generation      that stabilizes population and climate, and eradicates      poverty. Historians will record the choice, but it is ours      to make.    </p>    <p>      <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span>    </p>
