                    <p>      Many thanks for your enthusiastic review of our      just-released book, <em>The Survival Greenhouse,</em> in      the Access section of MOTHER NO. 39 ... and thanks also for      your nice presentation of my article on organic hydroponics      in the same issue. (Your color reproductions look better      than the Kodachrome slides you took them from!)    </p>    <p>      I'd like, however, to point out a couple of errors in the      article that could cause a budding organic hydroponic      gardener some needless frustration. As printed, my organic      nutrient formula reads (pp. 34-35) "one small-size      Quaker Oats box full of a mixture containing equal parts      rabbit manure, chicken manure, earthworm castings (manure),      and wood ashes" to 20 gallons of well water or fish tank      effluent. The correct ratio is one small oatmeal box full      of <em>each</em> of the ingredients listed- i.e.,      four measures, one of each component-in the same 20      gallons of liquid. Putting only <em>one</em> measure of the      combined ingredients into that much water would result in a      very weak solution.    </p>    <p>      The second error is in the paragraph (p. 35) dealing with      the wilting phenomenon we observed with plants raised in      the non-organic solution: "Within five minutes of being fed      the organic nutrient solution, however, all wilt symptoms      disappeared." The fact of the matter is, the non-organic      plants were kept "pure"- that is, they received no      organic nutrients-in order to make the experiment      valid. The roots of the wilted plants were flushed with the      commercial formula, and perked up-as      stated-immediately. The organically fed plants needed      <em>no</em> extra feeding at this time of day.    </p>    <p>      (We explain the wilting phenomenon with the commercial      solution in the chapter on organic hydroponics in our book.      Briefly, the problem has to do with an excess nutrient salt      concentration around the plant roots. The organic liquid is      significantly weaker than the commercial nutrient solution      and doesn't cause wilting ... though conceivably it could      do so if made too strong.)    </p>    <p>      I hope the article encourages MOTHER's readers to give      hydroponics a try. For my money, it's the <em>only</em> way      to go in a greenhouse vegetable garden. Meanwhile, our      experiments continue ... and, as usual, we'll keep you      posted on the results.    </p>    <p>      James B. DeKorne<br />      El Rito, N.M.    </p>
