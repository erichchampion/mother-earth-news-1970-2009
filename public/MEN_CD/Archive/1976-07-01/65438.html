        <p>About a year and a half ago-when 35 students at Coburg Elementary School outside Eugene, Oregon decided that they wanted to learn more about wind energy-they also decided that they wouldn't be satisfied with simply reading a book on the subject.</p><p>Instead, the group of 5th and 6th graders-along with their teacher, Gary Raze-chose to <em>build</em> a 33-foot-tall, 500-watt-output Savonius rotor . . . a rotor which is now used to run nine 50-watt light bulbs inside their classroom.</p><p>The inspiration for the class project came back in the winter of 1975 when Gerald Ford-as part of his "Whip Inflation Now" program-urged all Americans to become more energy conscious. "We wanted to find a way to help save electricity," 6th grade student Debbie Lueck explains. "So when Mr. Raze found an idea in THE <span style="font-size: 14px; font-variant: small-caps;">Mother Earth News</span> (restricted) , Issue No. 26, for something called the Savonius rotor-and told us how it works-we all thought it'd be a great project for the class!"</p><p>Raze singled out the S-rotor design in particular because [1] such a windplant would-by virtue of its low speed of operation-require less precision in its construction and balancing than a conventional Stewart-type rotor, and [2] parts would be easy to find, meaning-in turn-that [3] the cost of the undertaking could be kept reasonably low.</p><p>The third point was vitally important, since-educational budgets being what they are these days-Raze knew the class could rely on no funding from the school district. Happily, businesses and parents around the Eugene area contributed nearly all the parts needed for the windplant . . . and the class was able-by making and selling hanging wooden candleholders after school-to raise enough money to purchase the few items that <em>weren't</em> donated.</p><p>Thus, it was possible for Gary Raze and his students to build their wind generator (or "WIN" generator, as the class likes to call it) over a three-month period at a cost of only $100!</p><p>How does the finished plant work? The entire system revolves (if you will) around a recycled 45-amp Dodge alternator which is driven-via belts and pulleys-at 18 times the rotational speed of the S-rotor itself. That is, when the three-story-tall WIN turbine turns at a modest 33 rpm-as it does in a 7- to 8-mph breeze-the alternator spins at some 600 rpm . . . and produces five amperes of electrical current. This "juice" can then be used either to [A] charge the system's six heavy-duty 12-volt car batteries, or [B] run nine 12-volt, 50-watt bulbs that Raze and his pupils have rigged to light their classroom.</p><p>In a <em>strong</em> wind-when the S-rotor turns at about 60 rpm-the alternator, spinning at more than 1,000 rpm, puts out a full 40 amps of 12-volt current. Which means that-if you multiply 40 X 12-the system is capable of delivering something like 480 watts of power . . . which ain't bad for a Savonius rotor assembled by grade school youngsters at a total cost of $100!</p><p>We salute you, Mr. Raze . . . and we salute the students who participated in the WIN generator project. More power to you!</p>
